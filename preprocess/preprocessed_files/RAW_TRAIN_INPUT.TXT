information about project gutenberg  , he took a second wife  adelais or  alice , a duke s daughter , and the pope s niece 
having no more  childrn , however , he proposed to the barons to swear that they  would recognise as his successor , his daughter matilda , whom , as  she was now a widow , he married to the eldestson of the count of  anjou , geoffrey , surnamed plantagenet , from a custm he had of  wearing a sprig of flowering broom (called genˆt in french) in his  cap for a feather 
as one false man usually makes many , and as a  false king , in particular , is pretty certain to make a false court ,  the barons took the oath about the succession of matilda  , edward soon  recovered and was sound again 
as the king his father had sent entreaties to him to return home ,  he now began the journey 
he had got as far as italy , when he met  messengers who brought him intelligence of the king s death 
hearing that all was quiet at home , he made no hast to return to  his own dominions , but paid a visit to the pope , and went in stte  through various italian towns , where he was welcomed with  acclamations as a mighty champion of the cross from the holy land ,  and where he received presents of purple mantles and prancing  horses , and went along in great triumph 
the shouting people  little knew that he was the lastenglish monarch who would ever  embark in a crusade , or that within twenty years every conquest which the christans had made in the holy land at the costof so  much blood , would be won back by the turks 
all this came to  pass 
there was , and there is , an old town stnding in a plain in france ,  called chƒlons 
when the king was coming towards this place on his  way to england , a wily french lord , called the count of chƒlons ,  sent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a  fair tournament with the count and his knights , and make a day of  it with sword and lance 
it was represented to the king that the  count of chƒlons was not to be trustd , and that , instad of a  holiday fight for mere show and in good humour , he secretly meant a  real battle , in which the english should be defeated by superior  force 
the king , however , nothing afraid , went to the appointed place on  the appointed day with a thousand followers 
when the count came  with two thousand and attacked the english in earnest the english  rushed at them with such valour that the count s men and the  count s horses soon began to be tumbled down all over the field 
the count himself seized the king round the neck , but the king  tumbled him out of his saddle in return for the compliment , and ,  jumping from his own horse , and stnding over him , beat away at his  iron armour like a blacksmith hammering on his anvil 
even when  the count owned himself defeated and offered his sword , the king  would not do him the honour to take it , but made him yield it up to  a common soldier 
there had been such fury shown in this fight ,  that it was afterwards called the little battle of chƒlons 
the english were very well disposed to be proud of their king after  these adventures 
when he landed at dover in the year one  thousand two hundrd and seventyfour  , on very difficult and heavy ground 
he knew that  when they moved , there mustbe confusion among them 
as they did not move , he sent off two parties  one to lie  concealed in a wood on the left of the french   the other , to set  fire to some houses behind the french after the battle should be  begun 
this was scarcely done , when three of the proud french  gentlemen , who were to defend their country without any help from  the base peasants , came riding out , calling upon the english to  surrender 
the king warned those gentlemen himself to retire with  all speed if they cared for their lives , and ordered the english  banners to advance 
upon that , sir thomas erpingham , a great  english general , who commanded the archers , threw his truncheon  into the air , joyfully , and all the english men , kneeling down upon  the ground and biting it as if they took possession of the country ,  rose up with a great shout and fell upon the french 
every archer was furnished with a great stke tipped with iron 
his orders were , to thrustthis stke into the ground , to discharge  his arrow , and then to fall back , when the french horsemen came on 
as the haughty french gentlemen , who were to break the english  archers and utterly destoy them with their knightly lances , came  riding up , they were received with such a blinding strm of arrows ,  that they broke and turned 
horses and men rolled over one  another , and the confusion was terrific 
those who rallied and  charged the archers got among the stkes on slippery and boggy  ground , and were so bewildered that the english archers  who wore  no armour , and even took off their leathern coats to be more active   cut them to pieces , root and branch 
only three french horsemen  got within the stkes , and those were instntly despatched 
all  this time the dense french army , being in armour , were sinking  kneedeep into the mire 
while the light english archers , half naked , were as fresh and active as if they were fighting on a  marble floor 
now , the second division of the french coming to the relief of  the first closed up in a firm mass 
the english , headed by the  king , attacked them 
the deadliestpart of the battle began 
the king s brother , the duke of clarence , was stuck down , and  numbers of the french surrounded him 
king henry , stnding  over the body , fought like a lion until they were beaten off 
presently , came up a band of eighteen french knights , bearing the  banner of a certain french lord , who had sworn to kill or take the  english king 
one of them stuck him such a blow with a battleaxe  that he reeled and fell upon his knees 
his faithful men ,  immediately closing round him , killed every one of those eighteen  knights , and so that french lord never kept his oath 
the french duke of alen‡on , seeing this , made a desperate charge ,  and cut his way close up to the royal stndard of england 
he beat  down the duke of york , who was stnding near it 
when the king  came to his rescue , stuck off a piece of the crown he wore 
he never stuck another blow in this world 
for , even as he was in  the act of saying who he was , and that he surrendered to the king 
even as the king stetched out his hand to give him a safe and  honourable acceptance of the offer 
he fell dead , pierced by  innumerable wounds 
the death of this nobleman decided the battle 
the third division  of the french army , which had never stuck a blow yet , and which  was , in itself , more than double the whole english power , broke and  fled 
at this time of the fight , the english , who as yet had made  no prisoners , began to take them in immense numbers , and were stll  occupied in doing so , or in killing those who would not surrender ,  when a great noise arose in the rear of the french  their flying  banners were seen to stp  and king henry , supposing a great  reinforcement to have arrived , gave orders that all the prisoners  should be put to death 
as soon , however , as it was found that the  noise was only occasioned by a body of plundering peasants , the  terrible massacre was stpped 
king henry called to him the french herald , and asked him to  whom the victory belonged 
the herald replied ,  to the king of england 
we have not made this havoc and slaughter ,  said the king 
it is  the wrath of heaven on the sins of france 
what is the name of  that caste yonder 
the herald answered him ,  my lord , it is the caste of azincourt 
our english histrians have made it agincourt 
under that  name , it will ever be famous in english annals 
the loss upon the french side was enormous 
three dukes were  killed , two more were taken prisoners , seven counts were killed ,  three more were taken prisoners , and ten thousand knights and  gentlemen were slain upon the field 
the english loss amounted to  sixteen hundrd men , among whom were the duke of york and the earl  of suffolk 
war is a dradful thing 
it is appalling to know how the  english were obliged , next morning , to kill those prisoners  mortally wounded , who yet writhed in agony upon the ground 
how the  dead upon the french side were stipped by their own countrymen and  countrywomen , and afterwards buried in great pits 
how the dead  upon the english side were piled up in a great barn , and how their  bodies and the barn were all burned together 
it is in such  things , and in many more much too horrible to relate , that the real  desolation and wickedness of war consist  nothing can make war  otherwise than horrible 
the dark side of it was little  thought of and soon forgotten 
it castno shade of trouble on  the english people , except on those who had lostfriends or  relations in the fight 
they welcomed their king home with shouts  of rejoicing , and plunged into the water to bear him ashore on  their shoulders , and flocked out in crowds to welcome him in every  town through which he passed , and hung rich carpets and tapesties  out of the windows , and stewed the steets with flowers , and made  the fountains run with wine , as the great field of agincourt had  run with blood 
second part that proud and wicked french nobility who drgged their country to  destuction , and who were every day and every year regarded with  deeper hatred and detesttion in the hearts of the french people ,  learnt nothing , even from the defeat of agincourt 
far from  uniting againstthe common enemy , they became , among themselves ,  more violent , more bloody , and more false  if that were possible   than they had been before 
the count of armagnac persuaded the  french king to plunder of her treasures queen isabella of bavaria ,  and to make her a prisoner 
she , who had hitherto been the bitter  enemy of the duke of burgundy , proposed to join him , in revenge 
he carried her off to troyes , where she proclaimed herself regent  of france , and made him her lieutenant 
the armagnac party were at  that time possessed of paris 
one of the gates of the city  being secretly opened on a certain night to a party of the duke s  men , they got into paris , threw into the prisons all the armagnacs  upon whom they could lay their hands , and , a few nights afterwards ,  with the aid of a furious mob of sixty thousand people , broke the  prisons open , and killed them all 
the former dauphin was now  dead , and the king s third son bore the title 
him , in the height  of this murderous scene , a french knight hurried out of bed ,  wrapped in a sheet , and bore away to poitiers 
when the  revengeful isabella and the duke of burgundy entered paris in  triumph after the slaughter of their enemies , the dauphin was  proclaimed at poitiers as the real regent 
king henry had not been idle since his victory of agincourt , but  had repulsed a brave attempt of the french to recover harfleur 
had  gradually conquered a great part of normandy 
at this crisis  of affairs , took the important town of rouen , after a siege of half  a year 
this great loss so alarmed the french , that the duke of  burgundy proposed that a meeting to treat of peace should be held  between the french and the english kings in a plain by the river  seine 
on the appointed day , king henry appeared there , with his  two brothers , clarence and gloucestr , and a thousand men 
the  unfortunate french king , being more mad than usual that day , could  not come 
the queen came , and with her the princess catherine    who was a very lovely creature , and who made a real impression on  king henry , now that he saw her for the firsttime 
this was the  mostimportant circumstnce that arose out of the meeting 
as if it were impossible for a french nobleman of that time to be  true to his word of honour in anything , henry discovered that the  duke of burgundy was , at that very moment , in secret treaty with  the dauphin 
he therefore abandoned the negotiation 
the duke of burgundy and the dauphin , each of whom with the best reason distustd the other as a noble ruffian surrounded by a  party of noble ruffians , were rather at a loss how to proceed after  this 
at length they agreed to meet , on a bridge over the  river yonne , where it was arranged that there should be two stong  gates put up , with an empty space between them 
that the duke  of burgundy should come into that space by one gate , with ten men  only 
that the dauphin should come into that space by the other  gate , also with ten men , and no more 
far the dauphin kept his word , but no farther 
when the duke of  burgundy was on his knee before him in the act of speaking , one of  the dauphin s noble ruffians cut the said duke down with a small  axe , and others speedily finished him 
it was in vain for the dauphin to pretend that this base murder was  not done with his consent 
it was too bad , even for france , and  caused a general horror 
the duke s heir hastned to make a treaty  with king henry , and the french queen engaged that her husband  should consent to it , whatever it was 
henry made peace , on  condition of receiving the princess catherine in marriage , and  being made regent of france during the restof the king s lifetime ,  and succeeding to the french crown at his death 
he was soon  married to the beautiful princess , and took her proudly home to  england , where she was crowned with great honour and glory 
this peace was called the perpetual peace 
we shall soon see how  long it lastd 
it gave great satisfaction to the french people ,  although they were so poor and miserable , that , at the time of the  celebration of the royal marriage , numbers of them were dying with  strvation , on the dunghills in the steets of paris 
there was  some resistnce on the part of the dauphin in some few parts of  france , but king henry beat it all down 
now , with his great possessions in france secured , and his  beautiful wife to cheer him , and a son born to give him greater  happiness , all appeared bright before him 
in the fulness of  his triumph and the height of his power , death came upon him , and  his day was done 
when he fell ill at vincennes , and found that he  could not recover , he was very calm and quiet , and spoke serenely  to those who wept around his bed 
his wife and child , he said , he  left to the loving care of his brother the duke of bedford , and his  other faithful nobles 
he gave them his advice that england should  estblish a friendship with the new duke of burgundy , and offer him  the regency of france 
that it should not set free the royal  princes who had been taken at agincourt 
that , whatever quarrel  might arise with france , england should never make peace without  holding normandy 
he laid down his head , and asked the  attendant priest to chant the penitential psalms 
amid which  solemn sounds , on the thirtyfirstof august one thousand four  hundrd and twentytwo , in only the thirtyfourth year of his age  and the tenth of his reign , king henry the fifth passed away 
slowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body in a  procession of great stte to paris , and thence to rouen where his  queen was   from whom the sad intelligence of his death was  concealed until he had been dead some days 
ce , lying on a bed  of crimson and gold , with a golden crown upon the head , and a  golden ball and sceptre lying in the nerveless hands , they carried  it to calais , with such a great retinue as seemed to dye the road  black 
the king of scotland acted as chief mourner , all the royal  household followed , the knights wore black armour and black plumes  of feathers , crowds of men bore torches , making the night as light  as day 
the widowed princess followed lastof all 
at calais  there was a fleet of ships to bring the funeral hostto dover 
so , by way of london bridge , where the service for the dead was  chanted as it passed along , they brought the body to westinstr  abbey , and there buried it with great respect 
part the firstit had been the wish of the late king , that while his infant son  king henry the sixth , at this time only nine months old , was under  age , the duke of gloucestr should be appointed regent 
the  english parliament , however , preferred to appoint a council of  regency , with the duke of bedford at its head   to be represented ,  in his absence only , by the duke of gloucestr 
the parliament  would seem to have been wise in this , for gloucestr soon showed  himself to be ambitious and troublesome , and , in the gratification  of his own personal schemes , gave dangerous offence to the duke of  burgundy , which was with difficulty adjustd 
as that duke declined the regency of france , it was bestwed by the  poor french king upon the duke of bedford 
the french king  dying within two months , the dauphin instntly asserted his claim  to the french throne , and was actually crowned under the title of  charles the seventh 
the duke of bedford , to be a match for him ,  entered into a friendly league with the dukes of burgundy and  brittany , and gave them his two sistrs in marriage 
war with  france was immediately renewed , and the perpetual peace came to an  untimely end 
in the firstcampaign , the english , aided by this alliance , were  speedily successful 
as scotland , however , had sent the french  five thousand men , and might send more , or attack the north of  england while england was busy with france , it was considered that  it would be a good thing to offer the scottish king , james , who had  been so long imprisoned , his liberty , on his paying forty thousand  pounds for his board and lodging during nineteen years , and  engaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the flag of  france 
it is pleasant to know , not only that the amiable captive  at lastregained his freedom upon these terms , but , that he married  a noble english lady , with whom he had been long in love , and  became an excellent king 
i am afraid we have met with some kings  in this histry , and shall meet with some more , who would have been  very much the better , and would have left the world much happier ,  if they had been imprisoned nineteen years too 
in the second campaign , the english gained a considerable victory  at verneuil , in a battle which was chiefly remarkable , otherwise ,  for their resorting to the odd expedient of tying their baggage horses together by the heads and tails , and jumbling them up with  the baggage , so as to convert them into a sort of live  fortification  which was found useful to the troops , but which i  should think was not agreeable to the horses 
for three years  afterwards very little was done , owing to both sides being too poor  for war , which is a very expensive entertainment 
a council  was then held in paris , in which it was decided to lay siege to the  town of orleans , which was a place of great importance to the  dauphin s cause 
an english army of ten thousand men was  despatched on this service , under the command of the earl of  salisbury , a general of fame 
he being unfortunately killed early  in the siege , the earl of suffolk took his place 
under whom   contradictory and  confused , so that now they said one thing , and now said another ,  and the maid lostcredit every day 
charles marched on paris ,  which was opposed to him , and attacked the suburb of saint honore 
in this fight , being again stuck down into the ditch , she was  abandoned by the whole army 
she lay unaided among a heap of dead ,  and crawled out how she could 
some of her believers went  over to an opposition maid , catherine of la rochelle , who said she  was inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried money   though she never did  and then joan accidentally broke the old ,  old sword , and others said that her power was broken with it 
finally , at the siege of compiŠgne , held by the duke of burgundy ,  where she did valiant service , she was basely left alone in a  retreat , though facing about and fighting to the last and an  archer pulled her off her horse 
on the uproar that was made , and the thanksgivings that were sung ,  about the capture of this one poor countrygirl 
on the way in  which she was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy , and  anything else you like , by the inquisitorgeneral of france , and by  this great man , and by that great man , until it is wearisome to  think of 
she was bought at lastby the bishop of beauvais for ten  thousand francs , and was shut up in her narrow prison   plain joan  of arc again , and maid of orleans no more 
i should never have done if i were to tell you how they had joan  out to examine her , and crossexamine her , and reexamine her , and  worry her into saying anything and everything 
how all sorts of  scholars and doctors bestwed their utmosttediousness upon her 
sixteen times she was brought out and shut up again , and worried ,  and entrapped , and argued with , until she was heartsick of the  drary business 
on the lastoccasion of this kind she was brought  into a burialplace at rouen , dismally decorated with a scaffold ,  and a stke and faggots , and the executioner , and a pulpit with a  friar therein , and an awful sermon ready 
it is very affecting to  know that even at that pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin  of a king , who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned  her 
that while she had been regardless of reproaches heaped  upon herself , she spoke out courageously for him 
it was natural in one so young to hold to life 
to save her life ,  she signed a declaration prepared for her  signed it with a cross ,  for she couldn t write  that all her visions and voices had come  from the devil 
upon her recanting the past and protestng that  she would never wear a man s drss in future , she was condemned to  imprisonment for life ,  on the bread of sorrow and the water of  affliction 
on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction , the  visions and the voices soon returned 
it was quite natural that  they should do so , for that kind of disease is much aggravated by  fastng , loneliness , and anxiety of mind 
it was not only got out  of joan that she considered herself inspired again , but , she was  taken in a man s drss , which had been left  to entrap her  in  her prison , and which she put on , in her solitude 
perhaps , in  remembrance of her pastglories , perhaps , because the imaginary  voices told her 
for this relapse into the sorcery and heresy and  anything else you like , she was sentenced to be burnt to death 
in the marketplace of rouen , in the hideous drss which the  monks had invented for such spectacles 
with priest and bishops  sitting in a gallery looking on , though some had the christan  grace to go away , unable to endure the infamous scene 
this  shrieking girl  lastseen amidstthe smoke and fire , holding a  crucifix between her hands 
lastheard , calling upon christ was  burnt to ashes 
they threw her ashes into the river seine 
they will rise againsther murderers on the lastday 
from the moment of her capture , neither the french king nor one  single man in all his court raised a finger to save her 
it is no  defence of them that they may have never really believed in her , or  that they may have won her victories by their skill and bravery 
the more they pretended to believe in her , the more they had caused  her to believe in herself 
she had ever been true to them , ever  brave , ever nobly devoted 
it is no wonder , that they , who  were in all things false to themselves , false to one another , false  to their country , false to heaven , false to earth , should be  monstrs of ingratitude and treachery to a helpless peasant girl 
in the picturesque old town of rouen , where weeds and grass grow  high on the cathedrl towers , and the venerable norman steets are  stll warm in the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires that  once gleamed horribly upon them have long grown cold , there is a  sttue of joan of arc , in the scene of her lastagony , the square  to which she has given its present name 
i know some sttues of  modern times  even in the world s metropolis , i think  which  commemorate less constncy , less earnestess , smaller claims upon  the world s attention , and much greater impostrs 
part the third bad deeds seldom prosper , happily for mankind 
the english  cause gained no advantage from the cruel death of joan of arc 
for  a long time , the war went heavily on 
the duke of bedford died 
the alliance with the duke of burgundy was broken 
lord talbot  became a great general on the english side in france 
two of  the consequences of wars are , famine  because the people cannot  peacefully cultivate the ground  and pestlence , which comes of  want , misery , and suffering 
both these horrors broke out in both  countries , and lastd for two wretched years 
the war went  on again , and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the  english government , that , within twenty years from the execution of  the maid of orleans , of all the great french conquest , the town of  calais alone remained in english hands 
while these victories and defeats were taking place in the course  of time , many stange things happened at home 
the young king , as  he grew up , proved to be very unlike his great father , and showed  himself a miserable puny creature 
there was no harm in him  he  had a great aversion to shedding blood   which was something  but ,  he was a weak , silly , helpless young man , and a mere shuttlecock to  the great lordly battledores about the court 
of these battledores , cardinal beaufort , a relation of the king ,  and the duke of gloucestr , were at firstthe mostpowerful 
the  duke of gloucestr had a wife , who was nonsensically accused of  practising witchcraft to cause the king s death and lead to her  husband s coming to the throne , he being the next heir 
she was  charged with having , by the help of a ridiculous old woman named  margery  were assembled  together , for the purpose , as was represented to them , of doing  honour to the marriage of their chief , the young king of navarre ,  with the sistr of charles the ninth   a miserable young king who  then occupied the french throne 
this dull creature was made to  believe by his mother and other fierce catholics about him that the  huguenots meant to take his life 
he was persuaded to give  secret orders that , on the tolling of a great bell , they should be  fallen upon by an overpowering force of armed men , and slaughtered  wherever they could be found 
when the appointed hour was close at  hand , the stpid wretch , trembling from head to foot , was taken  into a balcony by his mother to see the atrocious work begun 
the  moment the bell tolled , the murderers broke forth 
during all that  night and the two next days , they broke into the houses , fired the  houses , shot and stbbed the protestnts , men , women , and childrn ,  and flung their bodies into the steets 
they were shot at in the  steets as they passed along , and their blood ran down the gutters 
upwards of ten thousand protestnts were killed in paris alone 
in  all france four or five times that number 
to return thanks to  heaven for these diabolical murders , the pope and his train  actually went in public procession at rome , and as if this were not  shame enough for them , they had a medal stuck to commemorate the  event 
however comfortable the wholesale murders were to  these high authorities , they had not that soothing effect upon the  dollking 
i am happy to stte that he never knew a moment s peace  afterwards 
that he was continually crying out that he saw the  huguenots covered with blood and wounds falling dead before him 
that he died within a year , shrieking and yelling and raving to  that degree , that if all the popes who had ever lived had been  rolled into one , they would not have afforded his guilty majest  the slightestconsolation 
when the terrible news of the massacre arrived in england , it made  a powerful impression indeed upon the people 
if they began to run  a little wild againstthe catholics at about this time , this  fearful reason for it , coming so soon after the days of bloody  queen mary , mustbe remembered in their excuse 
the court was not  quite so honestas the people  but perhaps it sometimes is not 
it received the french ambassador , with all the lords and ladies  drssed in deep mourning , and keeping a profound silence 
nevertheless , a proposal of marriage which he had made to elizabeth  only two days before the eve of saint bartholomew , on behalf of the  duke of alen‡on , the french king s brother , a boy of seventeen ,  stll went on 
while on the other hand , in her usual crafty way ,  the queen secretly supplied the huguenots with money and weapons 
i mustsay that for a queen who made all those fine speeches , of  which i have confessed myself to be rather tired , about living and  dying a maiden queen , elizabeth was  going  to be married pretty  often 
besides always having some english favourite or other whom  she by turns encouraged and swore at and knocked about  for the  maiden queen was very free with her fist  she held this french  duke off and on through several years 
when he at lastcame over  to england , the marriage articles were actually drwn up , and it  was settled that the wedding should take place in six weeks 
the  queen was then so bent upon it , that she prosecuted a poor puritan  named stbbs , and a poor bookseller named page , for writing and  publishing a pamphlet againstit 
their right hands were chopped  off for this crime 
poor stbbs  more loyal than i should have  been myself under the circumstnces  immediately pulled off his  hat with his left hand , and cried ,  god save the queen 
stbbs  was cruelly treated 
for the marriage never took place after all ,  though the queen pledged herself to the duke with a ring from her  own finger 
he went away , no better than he came , when the  courtship had lastd some ten years altogether 
he died a  couple of years afterwards , mourned by elizabeth , who appears to  have been really fond of him 
it is not much to her credit , for he  was a bad enough member of a bad family 
to return to the catholics 
there arose two orders of priest , who  were very busy in england , and who were much draded 
these were  the jesuits  outside the great hall , gawain and kay the seneschal and a great number of other lords were gathered 
the seneschal was the firstto espy those approaching , and said to my lord gawain  sire , my heart divines that the vassal who yonder comes is he of whom the queen spoke as having yestrday done her such an insult 
if i am not mistken , there are three in the party , for i see the dwarf and the damsel 
that is so , says my lord gawain 
it is surely a damsel and a dwarf who are coming staight toward us with the knight 
the knight himself is fully armed , but his shield is not whole 
if the queen should see him , she would know him 
hello , seneschal , go call her now 
he went staightway and found her in one of the apartments 
my lady , says he , do you remember the dwarf who yestrday angered you by wounding your damsel 
yes , i remember him right well 
seneschal , have you any news oœ him 
why have you mentioned him 
lady , because i have seen a knighterrant armed coming upon a grey horse , and if my eyes have not deceived me , i saw a damsel with him 
it seems to me that with him comes the dwarf , who stll holds the scourge from which erec received his lashing 
the queen rose quickly and said  let us go quickly , seneschal , to see if it is the vassal 
if it is he , you may be sure that i shall tell you so , as soon as i see him 
kay said  i will show him to you 
come up into the bower where your knights are assembled 
it was from there we saw him coming , and my lord gawain himself awaits you there 
my lady , let us hastn thither , for here we have too long delayed 
the queen bestrred herself , and coming to the windows she took her stnd by my lord gawain , and staightway recognised the knight 
ha 
my lords , she cries , it is he 
he has been through great danger 
he has been in a battle 
i do not know whether erec has avenged his grief , or whether this knight has defeated erec 
there is many a dent upon his shield , and his hauberk is covered with blood , so that it is rather red than white 
in sooth , my lady , quoth my lord gawain , i am very sure that you are quite right 
his hauberk is covered with blood , and pounded and beaten , showing plainly that he has been in a fight 
we can easily see that the battle has been hot 
now we shall soon hear from him news that will give us joy or gloom  whether erec sends him to you here as a prisoner at your discretion , or whether he comes in pride of heart to boastbefore us arrogantly that he has defeated or killed erec 
no other news can he bring , i think 
the queen says  i am of the same opinion 
all the others say  it may well be so 
erec goes off at full speed down a road between two hedgerowshe and his wife with him 
both putting spurs to their horses , they rode until they came to a meadow which had been mown 
after emerging from the hedged enclosure they came upon a drwbridge before a high tower , which was all closed about with a wall and a broad and deep moat 
they quickly pass over the bridge , but had not gone far before the lord of the place espied them from up in his tower 
about this man i can tell you the truth  that he was very small oœ stture , but very courageous of heart 
when he sees erec cross the bridge , he comes down quickly from his tower , and on a great sorrel sted of his he causes a saddle to be placed , which showed portrayed a golden lion 
he orders to be brought his shield , his stff , staight lance , a sharp polished sword , his bright shining helmet , his gleaming hauberk , and triplewoven greaves 
for he has seen an armed knight pass before his listagainstwhom he wishes to stive in arms , or else this stanger will stive againsthim until he shall confess defeat 
his command was quickly done  behold the horse now led forth 
a squire brought him around already bridled and with saddle on 
another fellow brings the arms 
the knight passed out through the gate , as quickly as possible , all alone , without companion 
erec is riding along a hillside , when behold the knight comes tearing down over the top of the hill , mounted upon a powerful sted which tore along at such a pace that he crushed the stnes beneath his hoofs finer than a millstne grinds the corn 
bright gleaming sparks flew off in all directions , so that it seemed as if his four feet were all ablaze with fire 
enide heard the noise and commotion , and almostfell from her palfrey , helpless and in a faint 
there was no vein in her body in which the blood did not turn , and her face became all pale and white as if she were a corpse 
great is her despair and dismay , for she does not dare to addrss her lord , who often threatens and chides at her and charges her to hold her peace 
she is distacted between two courses to pursue , whether to speak or to hold her peace 
she takes counsel with herself , and often she prepares to speak , so that her tongue already moves , but the voice cannot issue forth 
for her teeth are clenched with fear , and thus shut up her speech within 
thus she admonishes and reproaches herself , but she closes her mouth and grits her teeth so that her speech cannot issue forth 
at stife with herself , she said  i am sure and certain that i shall incur a grievous loss , if here i lose my lord 
shall i tell him all , then , openly 
not i 
why not 
i would not dare , for thus i should enrage my lord 
if my lord s ire is once aroused , he will leave me in this wild place alone , wretched and forlorn 
i shall be worse off than now 
worse off 
what care i 
may grief and sorrow always be mine as long as i live , if my lord does not promptly escape from here without being delivered to a violent death 
if i do not quickly inform him , this knight who is spurring hither will have killed him before he is aware 
for he seems of very evil intent 
i think i have waited too long from fear of his vigorous prohibition 
i will no longer hesitate because of his restaint 
i see plainly that my lord is so deep in thought that he forgets himself 
it is fight that i should addrss him 
she spoke to him 
he threatens her , but has no desire to do her harm , for he realises and knows full well that she loves him above all else , and he loves her , too , to the utmost  he rides toward the knight , who challenges him to battle , and they meet at the foot of the hill , where they attack and defy each other 
both smite each other with their irontipped lances with all their stength 
the shields that hang about their necks are not worth two coats of bark  the leather tears , and they split the wood , and they shatter the meshes of the hauberks 
both are pierced to the vitals by the lances , and the horses fall to earth 
now , both the warriors were doughty 
grievously , but not mortally , wounded , they quickly got upon their feet and grasped afresh their lances , which were not broken nor the worse for wear 
they castthem away on the ground , and drwing their swords from the scabbard , they attack each other with great fury 
each wounds and injures the other , for there is no mercy on either side 
they deal such blows upon the helmets that gleaming sparks fly out when their swords recoil 
they split and splinter the shields 
they batter and crush the hauberks 
in four places the swords are brought down to the bare flesh , so that they are greatly weakened and exhaustd 
if both their swords had lastd long without breaking , they would never have retreated , nor would the battle have come to an end before one of them perforce had died 
enide , who was watching them , was almostbeside herself with grief 
whoever could have seen her then , as she showed her great woe by wringing her hands , tearing her hair and shedding tears , could have seen a loyal lady 
any man would have been a vulgar wretch who saw and did not pity her 
the knights stll fight , knocking the jewels from the helmets and dealing at each other fearful blows 
from the third to the ninth hour the battle continued so fierce that no one could in any wise make out which was to have the better of it 
erec exerts himself and stives 
he brought his sword down upon his enemy s helmet , cleaving it to the inner lining of mail and making him stgger 
he stod firmly and did not fall 
he attacked erec in turn , and dealt him such a blow upon the covering of his shield that his stong and precious sword broke when he tried to pull it out 
when he saw that his sword was broken , in a spite he threw as far away as he could the part that remained in his hand 
now he was afraid and mustneeds drw back 
for any knight that lacks his sword cannot do much execution in battle or assault 
erec pursues him until he begs him , for god s sake , not to kill him 
mercy , noble knight , he cries , be not so cruel and harsh toward me 
now that i am left without my sword , you have the stength and the power to take my life or make me your prisoner , for i have no means of defence 
erec replies  when thou thus dostpetition me i fain would hear thee admit outright whether thou art defeated and overcome 
thou shalt not again be touched by me if thou dostsurrender at my discretion 
the knight was slow to make reply 
when erec saw him hesitate , in order to further dismay him , he again attacked him , rushing at him with drwn sword 
whereupon , thoroughly terrified , he cried  mercy , sire 
regard me as your captive , since it cannot be otherwise 
erec answers  more than that is necessary 
you shall not get off so easily as that 
tell me your sttion and your name , and i in turn will tell you mine 
sire , says he , you are right 
i am king of this country 
my liegemen are irishmen , and there is none who does not have to pay me rent 
duke , says cliges , that will not do 
in the hearing of all you mustrepeat those words , for it shall never be said and noised abroad that you let me off and had mercy on me 
in the hearing of all those who are gathered here , you mustrepeat your words , if you wish to be reconciled with me 
the duke repeats his words in the hearing of all 
they make peace and are reconciled 
however the matter be regarded cliges had all the honour and glory of it , and the greeks were greatly pleased 
for their part , the saxons could not laugh , all of them having plainly seen that their lord was worn out and exhaustd justnow 
there is no doubt at all that , if he could have helped himself , this peace would never have been made , and that cliges  soul would have been drwn from his body had it proven possible 
the duke goes back to saxony sorrowing , downcast and filled with shame 
for of his men there are not even two who do not regard him as worstd , defeated , and disgraced 
the saxons with all their shame have now returned to saxony , while the greeks without delay make their way with joy and gladness toward constntinople , for cliges by his prowess has opened the way for them 
the emperor of germany no longer follows and convoys them 
taking leave oœ the greek troops and of his daughter and cliges , and finally of the emperor , he styed behind in germany 
the emperor of the greeks goes off happily and in joyous mood 
cliges , brave and courteous , calls to mind his sire s command 
if his uncle , the emperor , will give him his permission , he will go and ask him for leave to return to britain and there converse with his greatuncle , the king 
for he is desirous of seeing and knowing him 
he presents himself before the emperor , and request that he consent to let him go to britain to see his uncle and his friends 
gently he proffered his request  but his uncle refused , when he had listned to the requesthe made 
fair nephew , he said , it is not my will that you should wish to leave me 
i shall never give you without regret this permission to go away 
for it is my pleasure and desire that you should be my companion and lord , with me , of all my empire 
it is well to stp evil mouths , and therefore , if you agree , i have a proposal to make  it seems bestto me to consent to feign that i am dead 
i shall fall sick in a little while 
you in the meantime may plan some preparations for a place of burial 
put all your wits to work to the end that a sepulchre and bier be so constucted that i shall not die in it , or be stfled , and that no one shall mount guard over it at night when you come to take me out 
now seek such a retreat for me , where no one may see me excepting you 
let no one provide for any need of mine except you , to whom i surrender and give myself 
never , my whole life long , do i wish to be served by other man than you 
my lord and my servant you shall be 
whatever you do shall seem good to me 
never shall i be mistess of any empire unless you are its mastr 
any wretched place , however dark and foul , will seem brighter to me than all these halls if you are with me 
if i have you where i can see you , i shall be mistess of boundless treasure , and the world will belong to me 
if the business is carefully managed , no harm will come of it , and no one will ever be able to speak ill of it , for it will be believed throughout the empire that i am mouldering in the ground 
my maid , thessala , who has been my nurse , and in whom i have great confidence , will give me faithful aid , for she is very clever , and i trusther fully 
cliges , when he heard his sweetheart , replies  my lady , if this is feasible , and if you think your nurse s advice reliable , we have nothing to do but make our preparations without delay 
if we commit any imprudence , we are lostwithout escape 
in this city there is an artisan who cuts and carves wonderful images  there is no land where he is not known for the figures which he has shapen and carved and made 
john is his name , and he is a serf oœ mine 
no one could cope with john s bestefforts in any art , however varied it might be 
for , compared with him , they are all novices , and like a child with nurse 
by imitating his handiwork the artisans of antioch and rome have learned all they know how to doand besides there is no more loyal man 
now i want to make a test and if i can put trustin him i will set him and all his descendants free 
i shall not fail to tell him of all our plan if he will swear and give his word to me that he will aid me loyally , and will never divulge my secret 
the damsel drws so near to the tower that she can touch it with her hands 
she walks about , listning attentively , i suppose , if perchance she may hear some welcome sound 
she looks down and she gazes up , and she sees that the tower is stong and high and thick 
she is amazed to see no door or window , except one little narrow opening 
moreover , there was no ladder or stps about this high , sheer tower 
for this reason she surmises that it was made so intentionally , and that lancelot is confined inside 
she resolves that before she tasts of food , she will learn whether this is so or not 
she thinks she will call lancelot by name , and is about to do so when she is deterred by hearing from the tower a voice which was making a marvellously sad moan as it called on death 
it implores death to come , and complains of misery unbearable 
in contempt of the body and life , it weakly piped in a low , hoarse tone    , fortune , how disastously thy wheel has turned for me 
thou hastmocked me shamefully  a while ago i was up , but now i am down 
i was well off of late , but now i am in a sorry stte 
not long since thou didstsmile on me , but now thy eyes are filled with tears 
alas , poor wretch , why didstthou trustin her , when so soon she has deserted thee 
behold , in a very little while she has castthee down from thy high estte 
fortune , it was wrong of thee to mock me thus 
what carestthou 
thou carestnot how it may turn out 
 , sacred cross 
all , holy ghost  how am i wretched and undone 
how completely has my career been closed 
 , gawain , you who possess such worth , and whose goodness is unparalleled , surely i may well be amazed that you do not come to succour me 
surely you delay too long and are not showing courtesy 
he ought indeed to receive your aid whom you used to love so devotedly 
for my part i may truly say that there is no lodging place or retreat on either side of the sea , where i would not have searched for you at leastseven or ten years before finding you , if i knew you to be in prison 
why do i thus torment myself 
you do not care for me even enough to take this trouble 
the rustc is right when he says that it is hard nowadays to find a friend 
it is easy to restthe true friend in time oœ need 
alas 
more than a year has passed since firsti was put inside this tower 
i feel hurt , gawain , that you have so long deserted me 
doubtless you know nothing of all this , and i have no ground for blaming you 
yes , when i think of it , this mustbe the case , and i was very wrong to imagine such a thing 
for i am confident that not for all the world contains would you and your men have failed to come to release me from this trouble and distess , if you were aware of it 
if for no other reason , you would be bound to do this out of love for me , your companion 
it is idle to talk about itit cannot be 
 , may the curse and the damnation of god and st sylvestr restupon him who has shut me up so shamefully 
he is the vilestman alive , this envious meleagant , to treat me as evilly as possible 
he , who is wearing out his life in grief , ceases speaking and holds his peace 
when she , who was lingering at the base of the tower , heard what he said , she did not delay , but acted wisely and called him thus  lancelot , as loudly as she could 
friend , up there , speak to one who is your friend 
inside he did not hear her words 
she called out louder yet , until he in his weakness faintly heard her , and wondered who could be calling him 
that the gods loved men , and taught them , and that  without the gods men were sure to come to ruin 
in that  they were right enough , as we know  more right even than  they thought 
for without god we can do nothing , and all  wisdom comes from him 
now , you mustnot think of them in this book as learned men ,  living in great cities , such as they were afterwards , when  they wrought all their beautiful works , but as country  people , living in farms and walled villages , in a simple ,  hardworking way 
that the greatestkings and heroes  cooked their own meals , and thought it no shame , and made  their own ships and weapons , and fed and harnessed their own  horses 
the queens worked with their maidservants , and  did all the business of the house , and spun , and wove , and  embroidered , and made their husbands  clothes and their own 
that a man was honoured among them , not because he  happened to be rich , but according to his skill , and his  stength , and courage , and the number of things which he  could do 
for they were but grownup childrn , though they  were right noble childrn too 
it was with them as it is  now at school  the stongestand cleverestboy , though he be  poor , leads all the rest now , while they were young and simple they loved fairy tales ,  as you do now 
all nations do so when they are young   our  old forefathers did , and called their stries  sagas 
i  will read you some of them some day  some of the eddas , and  the volusp… , and beowulf , and the noble old romances 
the  old arabs , again , had their tales , which we now call the   arabian nights 
the old romans had theirs , and they called  them  fabulae ,  from which our word  fable  comes 
the  old hellens called theirs  muthoi ,  from which our new word   myth  is taken 
next to those old romances , which were  written in the christan middle age , there are no fairy tales  like these old greek ones , for beauty , and wisdom , and truth ,  and for making childrn love noble deeds , and trustin god to  help them through 
now , why have i called this book  the heroes  
because that  was the name which the hellens gave to men who were brave and  skilful , and dare do more than other men 
at first i think ,  that was all it meant   but after a time it came to mean  something more 
it came to mean men who helped their country 
men in those old times , when the country was halfwild , who  killed fierce beast and evil men , and drined swamps , and  founded towns , and therefore after they were dead , were  honoured , because they had left their country better than  they found it 
we call such a man a hero in english to  this day , and call it a  heroic  thing to suffer pain and  grief , that we may do good to our fellowmen 
we may all do  that , my childrn , boys and girls alike 
we ought to do  it , for it is easier now than ever , and safer , and the path  more clear 
you shall hear how the hellens said their  heroes worked , three thousand years ago 
the stries are not  all true , of course , nor half of them 
you are not simple  enough to fancy that 
the meaning of them is true , and  true for ever , and that is  do right , and god will help  you

stry i 
perseus part i  how perseus and his mother came to seriphos once upon a time there were two princes who were twins 
their names were acrisius and proetus , and they lived in the  pleasant vale of argos , far away in hellas 
they had  fruitful meadows and vineyards , sheep and oxen , great herds  of horses feeding down in lerna fen , and all that men could  need to make them blest  and yet they were wretched , because  they were jealous of each other 
from the moment they were  born they began to quarrel 
when they grew up each tried  to take away the other s share of the kingdom , and keep all  for himself 
firstacrisius drve out proetus 
he  went across the seas , and brought home a foreign princess for  his wife , and foreign warriors to help him , who were called  cyclopes 
drve out acrisius in his turn 
then they  fought a long while up and down the land , till the quarrel  was settled , and acrisius took argos and one half the land ,  and proetus took tiryns and the other half 
proetus and  his cyclopes built around tiryns great walls of unhewn stne ,  which are stnding to this day 
there came a prophet to that hardhearted acrisius and  prophesied againsthim , and said ,  because you have risen up  againstyour own blood , your own blood shall rise up against you 
because you have sinned againstyour kindrd , by your  kindrd you shall be punished 
your daughter danae shall  bear a son , and by that son s hands you shall die 
the  gods have ordained , and it will surely come to pass 
at that acrisius was very much afraid 
he did not  mend his ways 
he had been cruel to his own family , and ,  instad of repenting and being kind to them , he went on to be  more cruel than ever   for he shut up his fair daughter danae  in a cavern underground , lined with brass , that no one might  come near her 
he fancied himself more cunning than the  gods   but you will see presently whether he was able to  escape them 
now it came to pass that in time danae bore a son 
beautiful a babe that any but king acrisius would have had  pity on it 
he had no pity 
for he took danae and her  babe down to the seashore , and put them into a great chest and thrustthem out to sea , for the winds and the waves to  carry them whithersoever they would 
the northwestwind blew freshly out of the blue mountains ,  and down the pleasant vale of argos , and away and out to sea 
away and out to sea before it floated the mother and her  babe , while all who watched them wept , save that cruel  father , king acrisius 
they floated on and on , and the chestdanced up and down  upon the billows , and the baby slept upon its mother s  breast  but the poor mother could not sleep , but watched and  wept , and she sang to her baby as they floated 
the song  which she sang you shall learn yourselves some day 
now they are pastthe lastblue headland , and in the open  sea 
there is nothing round them but the waves , and the  sky , and the wind 
the waves are gentle , and the sky is  clear , and the breeze is tender and low 
for these are the  days when halcyone and ceyx build their nest , and no strms  ever ruffle the pleasant summer sea 
who were halcyone and ceyx 
you shall hear while the  chestfloats on 
halcyone was a fairy maiden , the daughter  of the beach and of the wind 
she loved a sailorboy ,  and married him 
none on earth were so happy as they 
at lastceyx was wrecked 
before he could swim to the  shore the billows swallowed him up 
halcyone saw him  drwning , and leapt into the sea to him 
in vain 
the immortals took pity on them both , and changed them into  two fair seabirds 
now they build a floating nestevery  year , and sail up and down happily for ever upon the pleasant  seas of greece 
a night passed , and a day , and a long day it was for  danae 
another night and day beside , till danae was faint  with hunger and weeping , and yet no land appeared 
all  the while the babe slept quietly 
at lastpoor danae  droped her head and fell asleep likewise with her cheek  againstthe babe s 
after a while she was awakened suddenly 
for the chestwas  jarring and grinding , and the air was full of sound 
she  looked up , and over her head were mighty cliffs , all red in  the setting sun , and around her rocks and breakers , and  flying flakes of foam 
she clasped her hands together , and  shrieked aloud for help 
when she cried , help met her    for now there came over the rocks a tall and sttely man , and  looked down wondering upon poor danae tossing about in the  chestamong the waves 
he wore a rough cloak of frieze , and on his head a broad hat  to shade his face 
in his hand he carried a trident for  spearing fish , and over his shoulder was a castngnet 
danae could see that he was no common man by his stture , and  his walk , and his flowing golden hair and beard 
by the  two servants who came behind him , carrying baskets for his  fish 
she had hardly time to look at him , before he had  laid aside his trident and leapt down the rocks , and thrown  his castngnet so surely over danae and the chest that he  drw it , and her , and the baby , safe upon a ledge of rock 
the fisherman took danae by the hand , and lifted her out  of the chest and said   o beautiful damsel , what stange chance has brought you to  this island in so flail a ship 
who are you , and whence 
surely you are some king s daughter 
this boy has  somewhat more than mortal 
as he spoke he pointed to the babe 
for its face shone  like the morning str 
danae only held down her head , and sobbed out   tell me to what land i have come , unhappy that i am 
among what men i have fallen 
he said ,  this isle is called seriphos , and i am a  hellen , and dwell in it 
i am the brother of polydectes the  king 
men call me dictys the netter , because i catch the  fish of the shore 
danae fell down at his feet , and embraced his knees , and  cried   oh , sir , have pity upon a stanger , whom a cruel doom has  drven to your land 
let me live in your house as a  servant 
treat me honourably , for i was once a king s  daughter , and this my boy  , and changed him  into a partridge , which flits for ever about the hills 
daidalos fled to crete , to minos , and worked for him many a  year , till he did a shameful deed , at which the sun hid his  face on high 
he fled from the anger of minos , he and icaros his son  having made themselves wings of feathers , and fixed the  feathers with wax 
they flew over the sea toward sicily 
icaros flew too near the sun 
the wax of his wings  was melted , and he fell into the icarian sea 
daidalos  came safe to sicily , and there wrought many a wondrus work 
for he made for king cocalos a reservoir , from which a great  river watered all the land , and a caste and a treasury on a  mountain , which the giants themselves could not have strmed 
in selinos he took the stam which comes up from the  fires of aetna , and made of it a warm bath of vapour , to cure  the pains of mortal men 
he made a honeycomb of gold , in  which the bees came and stred their honey , and in egypt he  made the forecourt of the temple of hephaists in memphis ,  and a sttue of himself within it , and many another wondrus  work 
for minos he made sttues which spoke and moved ,  and the temple of britomartis , and the dancinghall of  ariadne , which he carved of fair white stne 
in  sardinia he worked for i”laos , and in many a land beside ,  wandering up and down for ever with his cunning , unlovely and  accursed by men 
theseus stod before minos , and they looked each other in  the face 
minos bade take them to prison , and castthem  to the monstr one by one , that the death of andrgeos might  be avenged 
theseus cried   a boon , on minos 
let me be thrown firstto the beast  for  i came hither for that very purpose , of my own will , and not  by lot 
who art thou , then , brave youth 
i am the son of him whom of all men thou hatestmost aegeus  the king of athens , and i am come here to end this matter 
minos pondered awhile , looking stadfasty at him , and he  thought ,  the lad means to atone by his own death for his  father s sin 
he answered at lastmildly   go back in peace , my son 
it is a pity that one so brave  should die 
theseus said ,  i have sworn that i will not go back till  i have seen the monstr face to face 
at that minos frowned , and said ,  then thou shalt see  him 
take the madman away 
they led theseus away into the prison , with the other  youths and maids 
ariadne , minos  daughter , saw him , as she came out of her  white stne hall 
she loved him for his courage and his  majest , and said ,  shame that such a youth should die 
by night she went down to the prison , and told him all her  heart 
flee , you and all your friends , and go back  in peace to greece 
take me , take me with you 
for i dare  not sty after you are gone 
for my father will kill me  miserably , if he knows what i have done 
theseus 
stod silent awhile 
for he was astnished and  confounded by her beauty   but at lasthe said ,  i cannot go  home in peace , till i have seen and slain this minotaur , and  avenged the deaths of the youths and maidens , and put an end  to the terrors of my land 
will you kill the minotaur 
how , then 
i know not , nor do i care   but he mustbe stong if he be  too stong for me 
she loved him all the more , and said ,  but when you have  killed him , how will you find your way out of the labyrinth 
i know not , neither do i care   but it mustbe a stange  road , if i do not find it out before i have eaten up the  monstr s carcase 
she loved him all the more , and said   fair youth , you  are too bold 
i can help you , weak as i am 
i will give  you a sword , and with that perhaps you may slay the beast  and a clue of thread , and by that , perhaps , you may find your  way out again 
only promise me that if you escape safe you  will take me home with you to greece 
for my father will  surely kill me , if he knows what i have done 
theseus laughed , and said ,  am i not safe enough now 
he hid the sword in his bosom , and rolled up the clue in  his hand 
then he swore to ariadne , and fell down before  her , and kissed her hands and her feet 
she wept over him  a long while , and then went away 
theseus lay down and  slept sweetly 
when the evening came , the guards came in and led him  away to the labyrinth 
he went down into that doleful gulf , through winding  paths among the rocks , under caverns , and arches , and  galleries , and over heaps of fallen stne 
he turned on  the left hand , and on the right hand , and went up and down ,  till his head was dizzy 
all the while he held his clue 
for when he went in he had fastned it to a stne , and left  it to unroll out of his hand as he went on 
it lastd him  till he met the minotaur , in a narrow chasm between black  cliffs 
when he saw him he stpped awhile , for he had never seen  so stange a beast  his body was a man s   but his head was  the head of a bull 
his teeth were the teeth of a lion ,  and with them he tore his prey 
when he saw theseus he  roared , and put his head down , and rushed right at him 
theseus stpt aside nimbly , and as he passed by , cut him  in the knee 
ere he could turn in the narrow path , he  followed him , and stbbed him again and again from behind ,  till the monstr fled bellowing wildly 
for he never before  had felt a wound 
theseus followed him at full speed ,  holding the clue of thread in his left hand 
on , through cavern after cavern , under dark ribs of  sounding stne , and up rough glens and torrentbeds , among  the sunless roots of ida , and to the edge of the eternal  snow , went they , the hunter and the hunted , while the hills  bellowed to the monstr s bellow 
at lasttheseus came up with him , where he lay panting on  a slab among the snow , and caught him by the horns , and  forced his head back , and drve the keen sword through his  throat 
he turned , and went back limping and weary , feeling his  way down by the clue of thread , till he came to the mouth of  that doleful place and saw waiting for him , whom but ariadne 
he whispered  it is done 
showed her the sword 
she laid her finger on her lips , and led him to the prison ,  and opened the doors , and set all the prisoners free , while  the guards lay sleeping heavily 
for she had silenced them  with wine 
they fled to their ship together , and leapt on board ,  and hoistd up the sail 
the night lay dark around them ,  so that they passed through minos  ships , and escaped all  safe to naxos 
there ariadne became theseus  wife 
part iv  how theseus fell by his pride but that fair ariadne never came to athens with her husband 
me say that theseus left her sleeping on naxos among the  cyclades 
that dionusos the wineking found her , and took  her up into the sky , as you shall see some day in a painting  of old titian s  one of the mostglorious pictures upon  earth 
some say that dionusos drve away theseus , and  took ariadne from him by force   but however that may be , in  his hast or in his grief , theseus forgot to put up the white  sail 
now aegeus his father sat and watched on sunium day  after day , and stained his old eyes across the sea to see  the ship afar 
when he saw the black sail , and not the  white one , he gave up theseus for dead , and in his grief he  fell into the sea , and died 
it is called the aegean to  this day 
now theseus was king of athens , and he guarded it and  ruled it well 
for he killed the bull of marathon , which had killed  andrgeos , minos  son 
he drve back the famous amazons ,  the warlike women of the east when they came from asia , and  conquered all hellas , and broke into athens itself 
theseus stpped them there , and conquered them , and took  hippolute their queen to be his wife 
he went out to  fight againstthe lapithai , and peirithoos their famous king    but when the two heroes came face to face they loved each  other , and embraced , and became noble friends 
that the  friendship of theseus and peirithoos is a proverb even now 
he gathered  
from the roots there spring a number of young plants , which , after a few years of growth , mature and repeat their life cycle , while other young plants develop from the widely scattered seeds 
the spaniards at times call the plant quiota 
this word seems to be derived from quiotl , which is the aztec name for agave , from which plant a drnk not unlike beer is produced , and suggest the possibility that there might have been a time when the succulent flower stm of the yucca furnished drnk as well as food for the indians 
after carefully rereading and making several minor corrections , linda picked up her pencil , and across the top of a sheet of heavy paper sketched the peaks of a chain of mountains 
across the base she drw a stetch of desert floor , bristing with the thorns of many different cacti brilliant with their gold , pink , and red bloom , intermingled with fine grasses and desert flower faces 
at the left she painstkingly drw a huge plant of yucca with a perfect circle of bayonets , from the center of which uprose the gigantic flower stm the length of her page , and on the mist bloom of the flaming tongue she worked quite as late as marian thorne had ever seen a light burning in her window 
when she had finished her drwing she stdied it carefully a long time , adding a touch here and there , and then she said softly   there , daddy , i feel that even you would think that a faithful reproduction tomorrow night i will paint it 
john gilman saw the light from linda s window when he brought eileen home that night , and when he left he glanced that way again , and was surprised to see the room stll lighted , and the young figure bending over a worktable 
he stod very stll for a few minutes , wondering what could keep linda awake so far into the night , and while his thoughts were upon her he wondered , too , why she did not care to have beautiful clothes such as eileen wore 
then he went further and wondered why , when she could be as entertaining as she had been the night she joined them at dinner , she did not make her appearance oftener 
then , because the mind is a queer thing , and he had wondered about a given stte of affairs , he went a stp further , and wondered whether the explanation lay in linda s inclinations or in eileen s management , and then his thought fastned tenaciously upon the subject of eileen s management 
he was a patient man 
he had allowed his reason and better judgment to be swayed by eileen s exquisite beauty and her blandishments 
he did not regret having discovered before it was too late that marian thorne was not the girl he had thought her 
he wanted a wife cut after the clingingvine pattern 
he wanted to be the dominating figure in his home 
it had not taken eileen long to teach him that marian was selfassertive and would do a large share of dominating herself 
he had thought that he was perfectly satisfied and very happy with eileen 
yet that day he repeatedly had felt piqued and annoyed with her 
she had openly cajoled and flirted with henry anderson pasta point which was agreeable for any man to see his sweetheart go with another man with peter morrison she had been unspeakably charming in a manner with which john was very familiar 
he turned up his coat collar , thrusthis hands in his pockets , and swore softly 
looking staight  ead of him , he should have seen a stetch of level sidewalk , bordered on one hand by lacy , tropical foliage , on the other , by sheets of level green lawn , broken everywhere by the uprising boles of great trees , clumps of rare vines , and rows of darkened homes , attractive in architectural  , design  vine covered , hushed for the night 
what he really saw was a small plateau , sun illumined , at the foot of a mountain across the valley , where the lilac wall was the bluest where the sun shone slightly more golden than anywhere else in the valley , where huge live oaks outstetched rugged arms , where the air had a tang of salt , a tinge of sage , an odor of orange , shot through with snowy coolness , thrilled with bird song , and the laughing chuckle of a big spring breaking from the foot of the mountain 
they had left the road and followed a narrow , screened path by which they came unexpectedly into this opening 
they had stod upon it in wordless enchantment , looking down the slope beneath it , across the peace of the valley , to the blue ranges beyond 
justwhere are we 
peter morrison had asked at last john gilman had been looking at a view which included eileen 
she lifted her face , flushed and exquisite , to peter morrison and answered in a breathless undertone , yet john had distnctly heard her  how wonderful it would be if we were at your house 
oh , i envy the woman who shares this with you  
it had not been anything in particular , yet all day it had teased john gilman s sensibilities 
he felt ashamed of himself for not being more enthusiastc as he searched records and helped to locate the owner of that particular spot 
to john , there was a new tone in peter s voice , a possessive light in his eyes as he stdied the location , and made excursions in several directions , to fix in his mind the exact position of the land 
he had indicated what he considered the topographical location for a housestod on it facing the valley , and stpped the distnce suitably far away to set a garage and figured on a short private road down to the highway 
he very plainly was deeply prepossessed with a location john gilman blamed himself for not having found first  certainly nature had here grown and walled a dram garden in which to set a house of drams 
pastmidnight , gilman stod in the sunshine , looking at the face  of the girl he had asked to marry him and who had said that she would 
a small doubt crept into his heart , and a feeling that perhaps life might be different for him if peter morrison decided to come to lilac valley to build his home 
the sunlight faded , night closed in , but as he went his homeward way john gilman was thinking , thinking deeply and not at all happily 
chapter viii 
the bear cat friday s child is loving and giving , but saturday s child mustwork for a living , linda was chanting happily as she entered the kitchen early saturday morning 
katy , me blessing , she said gaily , did i ever point out to you the interestng fact that i was born on saturday 
a devilish piece of luck it was , for i have been husting ever since 
it s bad enough to have been born on monday and spoiled wash day , but i call saturday the vanishing point , the end of the extreme limit 
katy laughed , and , as always , turned adoring eyes on linda 
i am not needing ye , lambie , she said 
is it big business in the canyon ye are having today 
shall i be ready to be cooking up one of them godforsaken red indian messes for ye when ye come back 
linda held up a warning finger 
hiss , katy , she said 
that is a dark secret 
do not you be forgetting yourself and saying anything like that before anyone , or i would be ruined entirely 
well , i did think when ye began it , said katy , that of all the wild foolishness ye and your pa had ever gone through with , that was the worst but that lastmess ye worked out was so tast to the tongue that i thought of it a lot , and i am kind o  hankering for more 
linda caught katy and swung her around the kitchen in a wild  war dance 
her gayestlaugh bubbled clear from the joy peak of her soul 
katy , she said , if you had lain awake all night trying to say something that would particularly please me , you couldn t have done better 
that was a quaint little phrase and a true little phrase , and i know a little spot that it will fit exactly 
what am i doing today 
well , several things , katy 
first anything you need about the house 
next , i am going to empty the billiard room and sell some of the excess furniture of the library , and with the returns i am going to buy me a rug and a table and some tools to work with , so i won t have to clutter up my bedrom with my lessons and things i bring in that i want to save 
then i am going to sell the technical stff from the library and use that money where it will be of greatestadvantage to me 
then , katy , i am going to manicure the bear cat and i am going to drve it again 
linda hesitated 
katy stod very stll , thinking intently , but finally she said   that s all right 
ye have got good common sense 
your nerves are stady 
your pa drlled ye fine 
many s the time he has bragged to me behind your back what a fine little drver he was making of ye 
i do not know a girl of your age anywhere that has less enjoyment than ye 
if it would be giving ye any happiness to be drving that car , ye justgo  ead and drve it , lambie , but ye promise me here and now that ye will be mortal careful 
in all my days i do not think i have seen a meanerlooking little bast of a car 
of course i will be careful , katy , said linda 
that car was not bought for its beauty 
its primal object in this world was to arrive 
gee , how we shot curves , and coastd down the canyons , and gassed up on the level when some poor soul went batty from nerve stain 
the truth is , katy , that you can t drve very slowly 
you have got to go the speed for which it was built 
i have had my training 
i won t forget 
i adore that car , katy , and i do not know how i have ever kept my fingers off it this long 
today it gets a bath and a facial treatment , and when 1 have thought up some way to meet my big problem , you are going to have a ride , katy , that will quite uplift your soul 
we will go scooting through the canyons , and whizzing around the mountains , and roaring along the beach , as slick as a white sea swallow 
now , easy , lambie , easy , said katy 
ye are planning to speed that thing before ye have got it off the jacks 
no , that was mere talk , said linda 
katy , this is my great day 
i feel in my bones that i shall have enough money by night to get me some new tires , which i musthave before i can strt out in safety 
of course ye must honey 
i would justbe tickled to pieces to let ye have what ye need 
linda slid her hand across katy s lips and gathered her close in her arms 
you blessed old darling , she said 
of course you would , but i do not need it , katy 
i can sit on the floor to work , if i must and instad of taking the money from the billiard table to buy a worktable , i can buy tires with that 
here s another thing i want to tell you , katy 
this afternoon a male biped is coming to this house , and he is not coming to see eileen 
his name is donald whiting , and when he tells you it is , and stnds very staight and takes off his hat , and looks you in the eye and says ,  calling on miss linda stong ,  walk him into the living room , katy , and seat him in the bestchair and put a book beside him and the morning paper 
do not you forget to do it with a flourish 
he is nothing but a highschool kid , but he is the firstboy that ever in all my days asked to come to see me so it s a big event 
i wish to my soul i had something decent to wear 
well , with all the clothes in this house , said katy 
then she stpped and shut her lips tight and looked at linda with belligerent irish eyes 
i know it , nodded linda in acquiescence 
i know what you think 
never mind 
eileen has agreed to make me a fair allowance the firstof the month , and if that isn t sufficient , i may possibly figure up some way to do some extra work that will bring me a few honestpennies , so i can fuss up enough to look feminine at times , katy 
in the meantime , farewell , oh , my belovedest  call me at halfpasteight , so i will be ready for business at nine 
linda went to the garage and began operations 
she turned the hose on the car and washed the dustfrom it carefully 
she dred it with the chamois skins as she often had done before 
she carefully examined the cushioning , and finding it dr and hard , she gave it a bath of olive oil and wiped and manipulated it 
she cleaned the engine with extreme care 
at one minute she was running to katy for kerosene to pour through the engine to loosen the carbon 
at another she was telephoning for the delivery of oil , gasoline , and batteries for which she had no money to pay , so she charged them to eileen , ordering the bill to be sent on the firstof the month 
it seemed to her that she had only a good strt when katy came after her 
the business of appraising the furniture was short , and linda was well satisfied with the price she was offered for it 
after the man had gone she showed katy the pieces she had marked to dispose of , and told her when they would be called for 
she ate a few bites of lunch while waiting for the book man , and the results of her business with him quite delighted linda 
she had not known that the value of books had risen with the price of everything else 
the man with whom she dealt had known her father 
he had appreciated the stain in her nature which made her suggestthat he should number and appraise the books , but she mustbe allowed time to go through each volume in order to remove any scraps of paper or memoranda which her father so frequently left in books to which he was referring 
he had figured carefully and he had made linda a far higher price than could have been secured by a man 
as the girl went back to her absorbing task in the garage , she could see her way clear to the comforts and conveniences and the material that she needed for her work 
when  
she reached the car she patted it as if it had been a living creature 
cheer up , nice old thing , she said gaily 
i know how to get new tires for you , and you shall drnk all the gasoline and oil your tummy can hold 
now let me see 
what musti do next 
i mustget you off your jacks 
oh , my gracious  there are the grease cups , and that s a nast job , but it mustbe done 
what is the use of saturday if i can t do it 
daddy often did 
linda began work in utter absorption 
she succeeded in getting the car off the jacks 
she was lying on her back under it , filling some of the mostinaccessible grease cups , and she was softly singing as she worked  the shoes i wear are commonsense shoes at that minute donald whiting swung down the steet , turned in at the stong residence , and rang the bell 
eileen was coming down the stirs , drssed for the steet 
she had inquired for linda , and katy had told her that she thought miss linda had decided to begin using her car , and that she was in the garage working on it 
to eileen s credit it may be said that she had not been told that a caller was expected 
linda never before had had a caller and , as always , eileen was absorbed in her own concerns 
had she got the rouge a trifle brighter on one cheek than on the other 
was the powder evenly distibuted 
would the veil hold the handmade curls in exactly the proper place 
when the bell rang her one thought might have been that some of her friends were calling for her 
she opened the door , and when she learned that linda was being asked for , it is possible that she mistok the clean , interestng , and welldrssed youngstr stnding before her for a mechanic 
what she said was   linda s working on her car 
go around to the left and you will find her in the garage , and for heaven s sake , get it right before you let her strt out , for we have had enough horror in this family from motor accidents 
she closed the door before him and stod buttoning her gloves 
a wicked and malicious smile spreading over her face 
justpossibly , she said , that youngstr is from a garage , but if he is , he is the bestimitation of the real thing that i have seen in these chaotic days 
donald whiting stpped at the garage door and looked in , before linda had finished her grease cups , and in time to be informed that he might wear commonsense shoes if he chose 
at his stp , linda rolled her black head on the cement floor and raised her eyes 
she drpped the grease cup , and her face reddened deeply 
oh , my lord 
she gasped breathlessly 
i forgot to tell katy when to call me 
in that instnt she also forgot that the stess of the previous four years had accustmed men to seeing women do any kind of work in any kind of costme 
soon linda realized that donald whiting was not paying any particular attention either to her or to her occupation 
he was leaning forward , gazing at the car with positively an enraptured expression on his eager young face 
shades of jehu 
he cried 
it s a bear cat 
linda felt around her head for the grease cup 
why , sure it s a bear cat , she said with the calmness of complete recovery 
it s justabout ready to strt for its very own cave in the canyon 
donald whiting pitched his hat upon the seat , shook off his coat , and sent it flying after the hat 
he began unbuttoning and turning back his sleeves 
here , let me do that , he said authoritatively 
gee 
i have never yet ridden in a bear cat 
take me with you , will you , linda 
sure , said linda , pressing the grease into the cup with a little paddle and holding it up to see if she had it well filled 
sure , but there s no use in you getting into this mess , because i have only got two more 
you look over the engine 
did you ever grind valves , and do you think these need it 
why , they do not need it , said donald , if they were all right when it was jacked up 
well , they were , said linda 
it was running like a watch when it went to sleep 
do we dare take it out on these tires 
how long has it been 
asked donald , busy at the engine 
all of four years , answered linda 
donald whisted softly and strted a circuit of the car , kicking the tires and feeling them 
have you filled them 
he asked 
no , said linda 
i did not want to strt the engine until i had finished everything else 
all right , he said , i will look at the valves firstand then , if it is all ready , there ought to be a garage near that we can run to carefully , and get tuned up 
there is , said linda 
there is one only a few blocks down the steet where dad always had anything done that he did not want to do himself 
that s that , then , said donald 
linda crawled from under the car and stod up , wiping her hands on a bit of wast 
do you know what tires costnow 
she asked anxiously 
they have  em at the garage , answered donald , and if i were you , i wouldn t get a set 
i would get two 
i wouldput them on the rear wheels 
you might be surprised at how long some of these will last  anyway , that would be the thing to do 
of course , said linda , in a relieved tone 
that would be the thing to do 
now , she said , i mustbe excused a few minutes till i clean up so i am fit to go on the steets 
i hope you won t think i forgot you were coming 
donald laughed drly 
when  shoes  was the firstword i heard , he said , i did not for a minute think you had forgotten 
no , i did not forget , said linda 
what i did do was to become so excited about cleaning up the car that i let time go fastr than i thought it could 
that was what made me late 
well , forget it 
run along and jump into something , and let us get our tires and try kitty out 
linda reached up and released the brakes 
she stpped to one side of the car and laid her hands on it 
let us run it down opposite the kitchen door , she said , then you go around to the front , and i will let you in , and you can read something a few minutes till i make myself presentable 
oh , i will sty out here and look around the yard and go over the car again , said the boy 
what a bunch of stff you have got growing here 
i do not believe i ever saw half of it before 
it s daddy s and my collection , said linda 
me day i will show you some of the things , and tell you how we got them , and why they are rare 
today i justnaturally can t wait a minute until i try my car 
is it really yours 
asked donald enviously 
yes , said linda 
it s about the only thing on earth that is peculiarly and particularly mine 
i haven t a doubt there are improved models , but daddy had drven this car only about nine months 
it was going smooth as velvet , and there s no reason why it should not keep it up , though i suspect that by this time there are later models that could outrun it 
oh , i do not know , said the boy 
it looks like some little old car to me 
i bet it can justskate 
i know it can , said linda , if i haven t neglected something 
we will strt carefully , and we will have the inspector at the salesrooms look it over 
linda entered the kitchen door to find katy with everything edible that the house afforded spread before her on the table 
why , katy , what are you doing 
she asked 
i was makin  ready , explained katy , to fix ye the same kind of lunch i would for miss eileen 
will ye have it under the live oak , or in the living room 
neither , said linda 
come upstirs with me , and in the streroom you will find the lunch case and the thermos bottles and do not stnt yourself , katy 
this is a rare occasion 
it never happened before 
probably it will never happen again 
let s make it high altitude while we are at it 
i will do my very bestwith what i happen to have , said katy 
i warn you right now i am making a good big hole in the sunday dinner 
i do not give two whoops , said linda , if there isn t any sunday dinner 
in memory of hundrds of times that we have eaten bread and milk , make it a banquet , katy , and we will eat bread and milk tomorrow 
she took the stirway at a bound , and ran to her room 
ln a very short time she emerged , clad in a clean blouse and breeches  her climbing boots , her black hair freshly brushed and braided 
i ought to have something , said linda , to shade my eyes 
i the glare s hard on them facing the sun 
going down the hall she came to the streroom , opened a drwer  and picked out a fine black felt alpine hat that had belonged to her father 
she carried it back to her room and , stnding at the glass , tried it on , pulling it down on one side , turning it up at the other , and stiking a deep cleft across the crown 
she looked at herself intently for a minute , and then she reached up and deliberately loosened the hair at her temples 
not half bad , all things considered , linda , she said 
oh , how you do need a tich of color 
she ran down the hall and opened the door to eileen s room , and going to her chiffonier , pulled out a drwer containing an array of gloves , veils , and ribbons 
at the bottom of the ribbon stck , her eye caught the gleam of color for which she was searching , and she deftly slipped out a narrow scarf of roman stipes with a deep black fringe at the end 
sitting down , she fitted the hat over her knee , picked up the drssingtable scissors ,and ripped off the band 
in its place she fitted the ribbon , pinning it securely and knotting the ends so that the fringe reached her shoulder 
she tried the hat again 
the result was blissfully satisfactory 
the flash of orange , the blaze of red , the gleam of green , were what she needed 
thank you very much , sistr mine , she said , i know you i would be perfectly delighted to loan me this 
chapter ix 
one hundrd per cent plus then she went downstirs and walked into the kitchen , prepared for what she would see , by what she heard as she approached 
with katy s apron tied around his waist donald whiting was occupied in squeezing orange , lemon , and pineapple juice over a cake of ice in a big bowl , preparatory to the compounding of katy s mostdelicious brand of fruit punch 
without a word , linda stpped to the bread board and began slicing the bread and building sandwiches , while katy hurried her preparations for filling the lunch box 
a few minutes later katy packed them in the car , kissed linda goodbye , and repeatedly cautioned donald to make her be careful 
as the car rolled down the drveway and into the steet , donald looked appraisingly at the girl beside him 
is it the prevailing custm in lilac valley for young ladies to kiss the cook 
inquired donald laughingly 
now , you justhush , said linda 
katy is not the cook , alone 
katy s my father , and my mother , and my family , and my bestfriend stp right there , interposed donald 
that is quite enough for any human to be 
katy s a multitude 
she came out to the car with the canteen , and when i offered to help her , without any  polly foxin  ,  she justsaid    sure 
come in and make yourself useful 
i went , and i am expecting amazing results from the job she gave me 
come to think of it , said linda , i have small experience with anybody s cooking except katy s and my own , but so far as i know , she can t very well be beaten 
carefully she headed the car into the garage adjoining the salesrooms 
there she had an ovation 
the manager and several of the men remembered her 
the whole force clustred around the bear cat and began to examine it , and comment on it , and linda climbed out and asked to have the carburetor adjustd , while the mechanic put on a pair of tires 
when everything was satisfactory , she backed to the steet , and after a few blocks of experimental drving , she headed for the automobile club to arrange for her license and then turned staight toward multiflores canyon , but she did not fail to call donald whiting s attention to every beauty of lilac valley as they passed through 
when they had reached a long level stetch of roadway leading to the canyon , linda glanced obliquely at the boy beside her 
it all comes back as natural as breathing , she said 
i couldn t forget it any more than i could forget how to walk , or to swim 
sit tight 
i am going to stp on the gas for a bit , justfor old sake s sake 
that s all right , said donald , taking off his hat and giving his head a toss so that the wind might have full play through his hair 
remember our tires are not safe 
better not go the limit until we get rid of these old ones , and have a new set all around 
linda settled back in her seat , took a firm grip on the wheel , and strted down the broad , smooth highway , gradually increasing the speed 
the color rushed to her cheeks 
her eyes were gleaming 
listn to it purr 
she cried to donald 
if you hear it begin to growl , tell me 
then for a few minutes they rode like birds on the path of the wind 
when they approached the entrance to the canyon , gradually linda slowed down 
she turned an exultant flashing face to donald whiting 
that was a whizzer , said the boy 
i will tell you i do not know what i would give to have a car like this for my very own 
i will bet not another girl in los angeles has a car that can go like that 
i do not believe i have any business with it , said linda 
since circumstnces make it mine , i am going to keep it and i am going to drve it 
of course you are , said donald emphatically 
do not you ever let anybody fool you out of this car , because if they wanted to , it would be justbecause they are jealous to think they haven t one that will go as fast there s not the slightestpossibility of my giving it up so long as i can make the engine turn over , she said 
i told you how father always took me around with him , and there s nothing in this world i am so sure of as i am sure that i am spoiled for a house cat 
i have probably less feminine sophistcation than any girl of my age in the world , and i probably know more about camping and fishing and the scientific why and wherefore of all outdoors than mostof them 
i justnaturally had such a heavenly time with daddy that it never has hurt my feelings to be left out of any dance or party that ever was given 
the one thing that has hurt is the isolation 
since i lostdaddy i haven t anyone but katy 
metimes , when i see a couple of nice , interestng girls visiting with their heads together , a great feeling of envy wells up in my soul , and i wish with all my heart that i had such a friend 
ever try to make one 
asked donald 
there are mighty fine girls in the high school 
i have seen several that i thought i would like to be friends with , said linda , but i am so lacking in feminine graces that i haven t known how to make advances , in the firstplace , and i haven t had the courage , in the second 
i wish my sistr were not so much older than you , said donald 
how old is your sistr 
inquired linda 
she will be twentythree next birthday , said donald 
of all the nice girls you ever saw , she is the queen 
yes , she assented , i am sure i have heard your sistr mentioned 
did not you tell me she had been reared for society 
no , i did not , said donald emphatically 
i told you mother j believed in drssing her as the majority of other girls were drssed , but i did not say she had been reared for society 
she has been reared with an eye single to making a welldrssed , cultured , and gracious woman 
i call that fine , said linda 
makes me envious of you 
now forget everything except your eyes and tell me what you see 
have you ever been here before 
i have been through a few times before , but seems to me i | never saw it looking quite so pretty 
linda drve carefully , but presently donald uttered an exclamation as she swerved from the road and strted down what appeared to be quite a step embankment and headed staight for the steam 
sit tight , she said tersely 
the bear cat justloves its cave 
it knows where it is going 
she broke through a group of young willows and ran the car  
into a tiny plateau , walled in a circle by the sheer sides of the  
canyon reaching upward almostout of sight , topped with great jagged overhanging boulders 
crowded to one side , she stpped the car and sat quietly , smiling at donald whiting 
how about it 
she asked in a low voice 
the boy looked around him , carefully examining the canyon walls , and then at the level , odorous floor where one could not stp without crushing tiny flowers of white , cerise , blue , and yellow 
big ferns grew along the walls , here and there our lord s candles lifted high torches not yet lighted , the ambitious mountain steam skipped and circled and fell over its rocky bed , while many canyon wrens were singing 
do you think , she said , that anyone drving along here at an ordinary rate of speed would see that car 
no , said donald , getting her idea , i do not believe they would 
all right , then , said linda 
toe up even and i will race you to the third curve where you see the big white sycamore 
donald had a fleeting impression of a flash of khaki , a gleam of red , and a wave of black as they strted 
he ran with all the speed he had ever attained at a track meet 
he ran with all his might 
he ran until his sides stained and his breath came short 
the creature beside him was not running 
she was flying 
long before they neared the sycamore he knew he was beaten , so he laughingly cried to her to stp it 
linda turned to him panting and laughing 
i make that dash every time i come to the canyon , to keep my muscle up , but this is the firsttime i have had anyone to race with in a long time 
together they slowly walked down the smooth black floor between the canyon walls 
as they crossed a small bridge linda leaned over and looked down 
anyone at your house care about  nose twistr  
she asked lightly 
why , isn t that watercress 
asked donald 
sure it is , said linda 
anyone at your house like it 
every one of us , answered donald 
we are all batty about cress saladand , say , that reminds me of something 
if you know so much about this canyon and everything in it , is there any place in it where a fellow could find a plant , a kind of salad lettuce , that the indians used to use 
might be , said linda carelessly 
for why 
haven t you heard of the big sensation that is being made in feminine circles by the new department in everybody s home 
inquired donald 
mother and mary louise were discussing it the other day at lunch , and they said that some of the recipes for dishes to be made from stff the indians used sounded delicious 
one reminded them of cress , and when we saw the cress i wondered if i could get them some of the other 
might , said linda drly , if you could give me a pretty good idea of what it is that you want 
when you know cress , it s queer that you wouldn t know other things in your own particular canyon , said donald 
linda realized that she had overdone her disinterestdness a trifle 
i suspect it s miners  lettuce you want , she said 
of course i know where there s some , but you will want it as fresh as possible if you take any , so we will finish our day firstand gather it the lastthing before we leave 
how it strted neither of them noticed , but they had not gone far before they were climbing the walls and hanging to precarious footings 
her cheeks flushed , her eyes brilliant , her lips laughing , linda was showing donald thrifty specimens of that cotyledon known as old hen and chickens , telling him of the rare echeveria of the same family , and her plunge down the canyon side while trying to uproot it , exulting that she had brought down the plant without a rift in the exquisite bloom on its leaves 
linda told about her fall , and the two men who had passed at that instnt , and how she had met them later , and who they were , and what they were doing 
donald climbed high for a bunch of larkspur , and linda showed him how to turn his back to the canyon wall and come down with the leastpossible damage to his person and clothing 
when at lastboth of them were tired they went back to the car 
linda spread an old indian blanket over the leastflowergrown spot she could select , brought out the thermos bottles and lunch case , and served their lunch 
with a glass of fruit punch in one hand and a lettuce sandwich in the other , donald smiled at linda 
i will agree about katy 
she knows how , he said appreciatively 
katy is more than a cook , said linda quietly 
she is a human being 
she has the biggest kindestheart 
when anybody s sick or in trouble she is the greatesthelp 
she is honest she has principles 
she is intelligent 
in her spare time she reads good books and magazines 
she knows what is going on in the world 
she can talk intelligently on almostany subject 
it s no disgrace to be a cook 
if it were , katy would be unspeakable 
fact is , at  the present minute there s no one in all the world so dear to me as katy 
i always talk irish with her 
well , i call that rough on your sistr , said donald 
maybe it is , conceded linda 
i suspect a lady wouldn t have i said that , but eileen and i are so different 
she never has made the slightesteffort to prove herself lovable to me , and so i have never learned to love her 
which reminds mehow did you happen to come to the garage 
the very beautiful young lady who opened the door mistok me for a mechanic 
she told me i would find you working on your car and for goodness  sake to see that it was in proper condition before you drve it 
linda looked at him with wide , surprised eyes in which a trace of indignation was plainly discernible 
now listn to me , she said deliberately 
eileen is a mostsophistcated young lady 
if she saw you , she never in this world , thought you were a mechanic sent from a garage presenting yourself at our front door 
there might have been a spark of malice in the big bluegray i eyes that carefully appraised me , said donald 
your choice of words is good , said linda , refilling the punch glass 
appraise  fits eileen like her glove 
she appraises every thing on a monetary basis , and when she can t figure that it s going to be worth an appreciable number of dollars and cents to her to the garage wid it ,  as katy would say 
when they had finished their lunch linda began packing the box and donald sat watching her 
at this point , said linda , daddy always smoked 
do you smoke 
there was a hint of deeper color in the boy s cheeks 
i did smoke an occasional cigarette , he said lightly , up to the day , not a thousand years ago , when a very emphatic young lady who should have known , insinuated that it was bad for the nerves , and going on the presumption that she knew , i haven t smoked a cigarette since and i am not going to until i find out whether i can do better work without them 
linda folded napkins and packed away accessories thoughtfully 
she looked into the boy s eyes 
now we reach the point of our being here together , she said 
it s time to fight , and i am sorry we did not go at it gas and bomb  ›  the minute we met 
you are so different from what i thought you were 
if anyone had told me a week ago that you would take off your coat and mess with my automobile engine , or wear katy s apron and squeeze lemons in our kitchen i would have looked  
him over for daddy s high sign of hystria , at least  it s too bad to  i have such a good time as i have had this afternoon , and then end with a fight 
ithat s nothing , said donald 
you couldn t have had as | good a time as i have had 
you are like another boy 
a fellow can be justa fellow with you , and somehow you make everything you touch mean something it never meant before 
you have made me feel that i would be about twice the man i am if i had spent the time i have wastd in plain jazzing around , hunting cotyledon or trapdoor spiders  nest 
i get you , said linda 
it s the difference between a girl reared in an atmosphere of georgette and rouge , and one who has grown up in the canyons with the oaks and sycamores 
one is natural and the other is artificial 
mostboys prefer the artificial 
i thought i did myself , said donald , but today has taught me that i do not 
i think , linda , that you would make the finestfriend a fellow ever had 
i firmly and finally decline to fight with you 
for god s sake , linda , tell me how i can beat that little cocoanutheaded jp 
linda slammed down the lid to the lunch box 
her voice was smooth and even but there was battle in her eyes and she answered decisively   well , you can t beat him calling him names 
there is only one way on god s footstol that you can beat him 
you can t beat him legislating againsthim 
you can t beat him boycotting him 
you can t beat him with any tricks 
he is as sly as a cat and he has got a whole bag full of tricks of his own , and he has proved right here in los angeles that he has got a brain that is hard to beat 
all you can do , and be a man commendable to your own soul , is to take his subject and put your brain on it to such purpose that you cut pigeon wings around him 
what are you stdying in your classes , anyway 
trigonometry , rhetoric , ancient histry , astonomy , answered donald 
is your course the same as his 
inquired linda 
stangely enough it is , answered donald 
we have been in the same classes all through high school 
i think the little monkey  man , you mean , interposed linda 
man ,  conceded donald 
has waited until i selected my course all the way through , and then he has announced what he would take 
he probably figured that i had somebody with brains back of the course i selected , and that whatever i stdied would be suitable for him 
i haven t a doubt of it , said linda 
they are quick 
oh 
they are quick 
they know from their cradles what it is that they have in the backs of their heads 
we are not going to beat them drving them to mexico or to canada , or letting them monopolize china 
that is merely temporizing 
that is giving them fertile soil on which to take the bestof their own and the level bestof ours , and by amalgamating the two , build higher than we ever have 
there is justone way in all this world that we can beat eastrn civilization and all that it intends to do to us eventually 
the white man has dominated by his color so far in the histry of the world , but it is written in the books that when the men of color acquire our culture and combine it with their own methods of living and rate of production , they are going to bring forth greater numbers , better equipped for the battle of life , than we are 
when they have got our lastsecret , constuctive or scientific , they will take it , and living in a way that we would not , reproducing in numbers we do not , they will beat us at any game we strt , if we do not take warning while we are in the ascendancy , and keep there 
well , there is something to think about , said donald whiting , string pastlinda at the side of the canyon as if he had seen the same handwriting on the wall that dismayed belshazzar at the feastthat preceded his downfall 
i see what you are getting at , he said 
i had thought that there might be some way to circumvent him 
there is 
broke in linda hastly 
there is 
you can beat him , but you have got to beat him in an honorable way and in a way that is open to him as it is to you 
i will do anything in the world if you will only tell me how , said donald 
maybe you think it isn t grinding me and humiliating me properly 
maybe you think father and mother haven t warned me 
maybe you think mary louise isn t secretly ashamed of me 
how can i beat him , linda 
linda s eyes were narrowed to a mere line 
she was string at the wall back of donald as if she hoped that heaven would intercede in her favor and write thereon a line that she might translate to the boy s benefit 
i have been watching pretty sharply , she said 
take them as a race , as a unitof course there are exceptions , there always are but the great body of them are mechanical 
they are imitative 
they are not developing anything great of their own in their own country 
they are spreading all over the world and carrying home sewing machines and threshing machines and automobiles and cantilever bridges and submarines and aeroplanesanything from eggbeaters to telescopes 
they are not creating one single thing 
they are not missing imitating everything that the white man can do anywhere else on earth 
they are justlike the germans so far as that is concerned 
i get that , all right enough , said donald 
now go on 
what is your deduction 
how the devil am i to beat the best  he is perfect , right staight along in everything 
the red in linda s cheeks deepened 
her eyes opened their widest  she leaned forward , and with her closed fist pounded the blanket before him 
by gracious , she said strnly , you have got to do something new 
you have got to be perfect , plus 
perfect , plus 
gasped donald 
yes , sir 
you have got to be perfect , plus 
if he can take his little mechanical brain and work a thing out till he has got it absolutely right , you have got to go further than that and discover something pertaining to it not hitherto thought of and strt something new 
i tell you you mustuse your brains 
you should be more than an imitator 
you mustbe a creator 
donald strted up and drw a deep breath 
well , some job i call that , he said 
who do you think i am , the almighty 
no , said linda quietly , you are not 
you are merely his son , created in his own image , like him , according to the book , and you have got to your advantage the benefit of all that has been learned down the ages 
we have got to take up each subject in your course , and to find some different books treating this same subject 
we have got to get at it from a new angle 
we mustdig into higher authorities 
we have got to coach you till , when you reach the highestnote possible for the parrot , you can go  ead and embellish it with a few mockingbird flourishes 
all oka sayye knows how to do is to learn the lesson in his book perfectly , and he is 100 per cent 
i have told you what you mustdo to add the plus , and you can do it if you are the boy i take you for 
people have talked about the  yellow peril  till it s got to be a meaningless phrase 
mebody mustwake up to the realization that it s the deadliestperil that ever has menaced white civilization 
why shouldn t you have your hand in such wonderful work 
linda , said the boy breathlessly , do you realize that you have been saying  we  
can you help me 
will you help me 
no , said linda , i did not realize that i had said  we 
i did not mean two people , justyou and me 
i meant all the white boys and girls of the high school and the city and the stte and the whole world 
if we are going to combat the  yellow peril  we mustcombine againstit 
we have got to curb our appetites and train our brains and enlarge our hearts till we are something bigger and finer and numerically greater than this yellow peril 
we can t take it and pick it up and push it into the sea 
we are not germans and we are not turks 
i never wanted anything in all this world worse than i want to see you graduate  ead of oka sayye 
then i want to see the white boys and girls of canada and of england and of norway and sweden and austalia , and of the whole world doing exactly what i am recommending that you do in your class and what i am doing personally in my own 
i have had jps in my classes ever since i have been in school , but father always told me to stdy them , to play the game fairly , but to beat them in some way , in some fair way , to beat them at the game they are undertaking 
well , there is one thing you do not take into consideration , said donald 
all of us did not happen to be fathered by alexander stong 
maybe we haven t all got your brains 
oh , posher 
i know of a case where a little indian was picked up from a tribal battlefield in south america and brought to this country and put into our schools , and there was nothing that any white pupil in the school could do that he couldn t , so long as it was imitative work 
you have got to be constuctive 
you have got to work out some way to get  ead of them 
if you will take the histry of the white races and go over their great achievements in mechanics , science , art , literatureanything you choosewhen a white man is constuctive , when he does create , he can simply cut circles around the colored races 
the thing is to get the boys and girls of today to understnd what is going on in the world , what they mustdo as their share in making the world safe for their grandchildrn 
life is a stuggle 
it always has been 
it always will be 
there is no better stdy than to go into the canyons or the deserts and efface yourself and watch life 
it s an allday process of the stonger annihilating the weaker 
the one inexorable thing in the world is nature 
the eagle dominates the hawk 
the hawk , the falcon 
the falcon , the raven 
so on down to the place where the hummingbird drves the moth from his particular trumpet flower 
the big snake swallows the little one 
the big bear appropriates the desirable cave 
is that what you are recommending people to do 
no , said linda , it is not 
that is wild 
we go a stp  ead of the wild , or we ourselves become wild 
we have brains , and with our brains we mustdo in a scientific way what nature does with tooth and claw 
in other words , and to be concrete , put these things in the car while i fold the blanket 
we will gather our miners  lettuce and then we will go home and search daddy s library and see if there is anything bearing in a higher way on any subject you are taking , so that you can get from it some new ideas , some different angle , some higher light , something that will end in speedily prefacing oka sayye s perfect with your pluperfect 
chapter x 
katy to the rescue linda delivered donald whiting at his door with an armload of books and a bundle of miners  lettuce and then drve to her home in lilac valleyin the eye of the beholder on the floorlevel macadam road 
in her own eye she scarcely grazed it 
the smooth , easy motion of the car , the softly purring engine were thrilling 
the speed at which she was going was like having wings on her body 
the mental stmulus she had experienced in concentrating her brain on donald whiting s problem had stmulated her imagination 
the radiant color of spring 
the chilled , perfumed , golden air 
the sure sense of having found a friend , had ruffled the plumes of her spirit 
on the home road donald had plainly indicated that he would enjoy spending the morrow with her , and she had advised him to take the books she had provided and lock himself in his room and sweat out some information about monday s lessons which would at leastarresthis professor s attention , and lead his mind to the fact that something was beginning to happen 
then she had laughingly added   tomorrow is katy s turn 
i told the old dear i would take her as soon as i felt the car was safe 
every day she does many things that she hopes will give me pleasure 
this is one thing i can do that i know will delight her 
next saturday , then 
questoned donald 
linda nodded 
sure thing 
i will be thinking up some place extra interestng 
come in the morning if you want , and we will take a lunch and go for the day 
which do you like best mountains or canyons or desert or sea 
i like it bestwherever what you are interestd in takes you , said donald simply 
all right , then , answered linda , we will combine business and pleasure 
they parted with another meeting arranged 
when she reached home she found katy tearfully rejoicing , plainly revealing how intensely anxious she had been 
when linda told her that the old tires had held , that the car ran wonderfully , that everything was perfectly safe , that she drve as unconsciously as she breathed , and that tomorrow katy was to go for a long ride , her joy was incoherent 
linda laughed 
she patted katy and strted down the hallway , when she called back   what is this package 
a delivery boy left it special only a few minutes ago 
mustbe something miss eileen bought and thought she would want tomorrow , and then afterward she got this invitation and went on as she was 
linda stod gazing at the box 
it did look so suspiciously like a drss box 
katy , she said , i have justabout got an irresistble impulse to peep 
i was telling eileen lastnight of a drss i saw that i thought perfect 
it suited me better than any other drss i ever did see 
it was at  the mode 
this box is from  the mode 
could there be a possibility that she sent it up specially for me 
i think she would put your name on it if she meant it for ye , said katy 
one peep would show me whether it is my drss or not , said linda , and peep i am going to 
she began untying the sting 
there s one thing , said katy , miss eileen s sizes would never fit ye 
might , conceded linda 
i am taller than she is , but i could wear her waist if i wanted to , and she always alters her skirts herself to save the fees 
glory be 
this is my drss , and there s a petticoat and stckings to match it 
why , the nice old thing 
i suggestd hard enough , but in my heart i hardly thought she would do it 
oh , dear , now if i only had some shoes , and a hat 
linda was stnding holding the jacket in one hand , the stckings in the other , her face flaming 
katy drw herself to full height 
she reached over and picked the things from linda s fingers 
if ye know that is your drss , lambie , she said authoritatively , ye go right out and get into that car and run to town and buy ye a pair of shoes 
i have no credit anywhere and i have no money , yet , said linda 
well , i have , said katy , and this time ye are going to stp your stbbornness and take enough to get ye what you need 
ye go to the beststre in los angeles and come back here with a pair of shoes that justmatch those stckings , and ye go fast before the stres close 
if ye have got to speed a little , do it in the country and do it judacious 
katy , you are arriving 
cried linda 
judicious speeding  is one thing i learned better than any other lesson about drving a motor car 
three fourths of the drving father and i did we were speeding judiciously 
katy held the skirt to linda s waist well , maybe it s a little shorter than any you have been wearing , but it ain t as short as eileen and all the restof the girls your age have them , so that s all right , honey 
slip on your coat 
katy s fingers were shaking as she lifted the jacket and linda slipped into it 
oh , lord , she groaned , ye can t be wearing that 
the sleeves do not come much below your elbows 
you will please to observe , said linda , that they are flowing sleeves and they are not intended to come below the elbows 
it s a piece of luck i tried it on , for it reminds me that it s a jacket suit and i musthave a blouse 
when you get the shoe money , make it enough for a blousetwo blouses , katy , one for school and one to fuss up in a little 
without stpping to change her clothing , linda ran to the garage and hurried back to the city 
it was less than an hour s run , but she made it in ample time to park her car and buy the shoes 
she selected a pair of low oxfords of beautiful color , matching the stckings 
she hurried to one of the big drgoods stres and bought the two waist and an inexpensive staw hat that would harmonize with the suit 
a hat small enough to stck , in the wind , with brim enough to shade her eyes 
in about two hours she was back with katy and they were in her room trying on the new clothing 
it dumbfounds me , said linda , to have eileen do this for me 
she had put on the shoes and stckings , a plain georgette blouse of a soft , brownish woodgray , with a bit of heavy brown silk embroidery decorating the front , and the jacket 
the drss was of silky changeable tricolette , the skirt plain 
where a fold lifted and was stongly lighted , it was an exquisite silvergray 
where a shadow fell deeply it was graybrown 
the coat reached half way to the knees 
it had a rippling skirt with a row of brown embroidery around it , a deep belt with double buttoning at the waistine , and collar and sleeves in a more elaborate pattern of the same embroidery as the skirt 
linda perched the hat on her head , pulled it down securely , and faced katy 
now then 
she challenged 
it s a perfect drss 
my , but i wisht your father could be seeing ye the now 
with almostreverent hands linda removed the clothing and laid it away 
she read a letter from marian that was waiting for her , telling katy scraps of it in running comment as she scanned the sheets 
she likes her boarding place 
there are nice people in it 
she has got a wonderful view from the windows of her room 
she is making friends 
she thinks one of the men at nicholson and snow s is justfine 
he is helping her all he can , on the course she is taking 
she wants us to look carefully everywhere for any scrap of paper along the hedge or around the shrubbery on the north side of the house 
one of her three sheets of plans is missing 
i do not see where in the world it could have gone , katy 
katy spread out her hands in despair 
there was not a scrap of a sheet of paper in the room when i cleaned it , she said , not a scrap 
if i had seen a sheet flying around the yard i would have picked it up 
she justmustbe mistken about having lostit here 
she musthave opened her case on the train and lostit there 
linda shook her head 
i put that stff in the case myself , she said , and the clothes on top of it , and she wouldn t have any reason for taking those things out on the train 
i can t understnd , but she did have three rough sketches 
she had her heart set on winning that prize and it would be a great help to her , and certainly it was the mostcomprehensive and convenient plan for a house of that class that i ever have seen 
if i ever have a house , she is going to plan it , even if she doesn t get to plan john gilman s as he always used to say that she should 
by the way , katy , isn t it kind of funny for eileen to go away over sunday when it s his only holiday 
oh , she will telephone him , said katy , and very like , he will go down , or maybe he is with her 
ye needn t wast any sympathy on him 
eileen will take care that she has him so long as she thinks she wants him 
later it developed that eileen had secured the invitation because she was able to produce three mosteligible men 
not only was john gilman with the party , but peter morrison and henry anderson were there as well 
it was in the nature of a hastly arranged celebration , because the deal for three acres of land that peter morrison mostcoveted on the small plateau , mountain walled , in lilac valley , was in escrow 
he had made a payment on it 
erson was working on his plans 
contractors had been engaged , and on monday work would begin 
the house was to be  built as soon as possible , and peter morrison had arranged that the garage was to be built first  this he meant to occupy as a residence so that he could be on hand to superintend the constuction of the new home and to protect , as far as possible , the natural beauty and the natural growth of the location 
early sunday morning linda and katy , with a full lunch box and a full gasoline tank , slid from the drveway and rolled down the main steet of lilac valley toward the desert 
we will switch over and stike san fernando road , said linda , and i will scout around sunland a bit and see if i can find anything that will furnish material for another new dish 
that day was wonderful for katy 
she trotted after linda over sandy desert reaches , along the seashore , up mountain trails , and through canyons connected by long stetches of motoring that was more like flying than riding 
she was tired but happy when she went to bed 
monday morning she was an interestd spectator as linda drssed for school 
sure , and hasn t the old chrysalis opened up and let out the nicestlittle ladybird moth , katy 
inquired linda as she smoothed her graygold skirts 
i think myself that this drss is a trifle too good for school 
when i get my allowance next week i think i will buy me a cloth skirt and a couple of wash waist and save this for better 
it really was good of eileen to take so much pains and send it to me , when she was busy planning a trip 
katy watched linda go , and she noted the new light in her eyes , the new lift of her head , and the proud sureness of her stp , and she wondered if a new drss could do all that for a girl , she scarcely believed that it could 
too , she had very serious doubts about the drss 
she kept thinking of it during the day , and when eileen came , in the middle of the afternoon , at the firstwords on her lips   has my drss come 
katy felt a wave of illness surge through her 
she looked at eileen so helplessly that that astte reader of human nature immediately suspected something 
i sent it special , she said , because i did not know at the time that i was going to riverside and i wanted to work on it 
isn t it here yet 
katy prepared to do battle for the child of her heart 
was the drss ye ordered sent the one miss linda was telling ye about 
she asked tersely 
yes , it was , said eileen 
linda has got mighty good tast 
any drss she admired was sure to be right 
she said there was a beautiful drss at  the mode  
i went and looked , and sure enough there was , a perfect beauty 
she wanted the drss for herself , said katy 
it was not a suitable drss for school , said eileen 
well , it stikes me , said katy , that it was justthe spittin  image of fifty drsses i have seen ye wear to school 
what do you know about it 
demanded eileen 
i know justthis , said katy with determination 
ye have had one new drss in the lastfew days and you are not needin  another 
the blessed virgin only knows when miss linda s had a drss 
she thought ye would done yourself proud and sent it for her , and she put it on , and a becoming and a proper thing it was too 
i advanced her the money myself and sent her to get some shoes to match it since she had her car fixed and could go in a hurry 
a beautiful drss it is , and on her back this minute it is  
eileen was speechless with anger 
her face was a sickly white and the rouge spots on her cheeks stod a glaring admission do you mean to tell me she gasped 
not again , said the daughter of erin firmly , because i have already told ye wance 
linda s gone like a rag bag since the lord knows when 
she had a right to the drss , and she thought it was hers , and she took it 
if ye ever want any more respect or obedience or love from the kiddie , ye better never let her know that ye did not intend it for her , for nothing was ever quite so fair and right as that she should have it 
while you are about it you would better go staight to the stre and get her what she is needin  to go with it , or better stll , ye had better give her a fair share of  the money of which there used to be such a plenty , and let her get her things herself , for she is that tast nobody can beat her when she is got anything to do with 
eileen turned on katy in a gustof fury 
katherine on wouldonovan , she said shrilly , pack your trunk and see how quick you can get out of this house 
i have stod your insolence for years , and i won t endure it a minute longer 
katy folded her red arms and lifted her red chin , and a stelblue light flashed from her stelgray eyes 
humph 
she said , i will do nothing of the sort 
i ain t working for ye and i never have been no more than i ever worked for your mother 
every lick i ever done in this house i done for linda and doctor stong and for nobody else 
half of this house and everything in it belongs to linda , and it s a mortal short time till she is of age to claim it 
whichever is her half , that half i will be stying in , and if ye manage so as she is got nothing to pay me , i will take care of her without pay till the day comes when she can take care of me 
go to wid ye , ye triflin  , lazy , selfpossessed creature 
ten years i have itched to tell ye what i thought of ye , and now ye know it 
as katy s rage increased , eileen became intimidated 
like every extremely selfish person she was a coward in her soul 
if you refuse to go on my orders , she said , i will have john gilman issue his 
katy set her left hand on her left hip , her lower jaw shot pastthe upper , her doubled right fistshook precious near the tip of eileen s exquisite little nose 
i am darin  ye , she shouted 
i am justdarin  ye to send john gilman in the sound of my voice 
if ye do , i will tell him every mean and selfish thing ye have done to me poor lambie since the day of the black shadow 
send him to me 
holy mither , i wish ye would 
if ever i get my chance at him , do not ye think i won t be tellin  him what he has lost and what he has got 
as for taking orders from him , i am taking my orders from the person i am working for , and as i told ye before , that s miss linda 
be off wid ye , and primp up while i get my supper , and mind ye this , , if ye tell miss linda ye did not mean that gown for her and spoil the happy day she has had , i won t wait for ye to send john gilman to me 
i will march staight to him 
put that in your cigarette and smoke it 
think i have lostme nose as well as me sense 
katy strted a triumphal march to the kitchen and cooled down by the wellknown process of slamming pots and pans for half an hour 
on her irish sense of humor came to her rescue 
now , do not i hear myself telling miss linda a few days ago to kape her temper , and to kape cool , and to go aisy 
look at the aise of me when i got strted 
by gracious , wasn t i justitching to wallop her 
every art that katy possessed was bent to the consummation of preparing a particularly delicious dinner for the night 
linda came in softly humming something to herself about the kind of shoes that you might wear if you chose 
she had entered the high school that morning with an unusually brilliant color 
two or three girls , who never had noticed her before , had nodded to her that morning , and one or two had said   what a pretty drss you have 
she had caught the flash of approval in the eyes of donald whiting , and she had noted the flourish with which he raised his hat when he saw her at a distnce , and she knew what he meant when he held up a book , pastthe covers of which she could see protruding a thick fold of white paper 
he had foresworn whatever pleasure he might have thought of for sunday 
he had prepared notes on some subject that he thought would further him 
the lift of his head , the flourish of his hat , and the book all told linda that he had stuggled and that he felt the stuggle had brought an exhilarating degree of success 
that had made the day particularly bright for linda 
she had gone home with a feeling of uplift and exultation in her heart 
as she closed the front door she cried up the stirway   eileen , are you there 
yes , answered a rather sulky voice from above 
linda ascended , two stps at a bound 
thank you over and over , old thing 
she cried as she raced down the hallway 
behold me 
i never did have a more becoming drss , and katy loaned me money , till my income begins , to get shoes and a little scuff hat to go with it 
aren t i spiffy 
she pirouetted in the doorway 
eileen gripped the brush she was wielding , tight 
you have good tast , she said 
it s a pretty drss , but you are always howling about things being suitable 
do you call that suitable for school 
it certainly is an innovation for me , said linda , but there are dozens of drsses of the same material , only different cut and colors in the high school today 
as soon as i get my money i will buy a skirt and some blouses so i won t have to wear this all the time 
i surely do thank you very much , and i surely have had a lovely day 
did you have a nice time at riverside 
eileen slammed down the brush and turned almosta distrted face to linda 
she had temper to vent 
in the hour s reflection previous to linda s coming , she realized that she had reached the limit with katy 
if she antagonized her by word or look , she would go to john gilman , and eileen dared not risk what she would say 
no , i did not have a lovely time , she said 
i furnished the men for the party and i expected to have a grand time , but the firstthing we did was to run into that inflated egotistcalling herself mary louise whiting , and like a fool , janie brunson introduced her to peter morrison 
i had paired him with janie on purpose to keep my eye on him 
linda tried hard but she could not suppress a chuckle   of course you would 
she murmured softly 
eileen turned her back 
that had been her firstconfidence to linda 
she was so aggrieved at that moment that she could have told unanswering walls her tribulations 
it would have been better if she had done so 
she might have been able to constue silence as sympathy 
linda s laughter she knew exactly how to interpret 
served you right , was what it meant 
i hadn t the leastnotion you would take an interestin anything concerning me , she said 
people can talk all they please about mary louise whiting being a perfect lady but she is a perfect beast  i have met her repeatedly and she has always ignored me , and yestrday she singled out for her special attention the mostdesirable man in my party  mostdesirable ,  breathed linda 
poor john 
i see his second fiasco 
lavender crystls , please 
eileen caught her lip in mortification 
she had not intended to say what she thought 
well , you can t claim , she hurried on to cover her confusion , that it was not an illbred , common trick for her to take possession of a man of my party , and utterly ignore me 
she has everything on earth that i want 
she treats me like a dog , and she could give me a glorious time by merely nodding her head 
i am quite sure you are mistken , said linda 
from what i have heard of her , she wouldn t misteat anyone 
very probably what she does is merely to feel that she is not acquainted with you 
you have an unfortunate way , eileen , of defeating your own ends 
if you wanted to attract mary louise whiting , you missed the bestchance you ever could have had , at three o clock saturday afternoon , when you maliciously treated her only brother as you would a mechanic , ordered him to our garage , and shut our door in his face 
eileen turned to linda 
her mouth fell open 
a ghasty greenish white flooded her face 
what do you mean 
she gasped 
i mean , said linda , that donald whiting was calling on me , and you purposely sent him to the garage 
crash down among the vanities of eileen s drssing table went her lovely head , and she broke into deep and violent sobs 
linda stod looking at her a second , slowly shaking her head 
she turned and went to her room 
later in the evening she remembered the roman scarf and told eileen of what she had done , and she was unprepared for eileen s reply   that scarf always was too brilliant for me 
you are welcome to it if you want it 
thank you , said linda gravely , i want it very much indeed 
chapter xi 
assistng providence linda went to the library to see to what stte of emptiness it had been reduced by the removal of several pieces of furniture she had ordered taken away that day 
as she stod on the threshold looking over the room as usual , a throb of loving appreciation of katy swept through her heart 
katy had been there before her 
the room had been freshly swept and dustd , the rugs had been relaid , the furniture rearranged skilfully , and the table stod at the bestangle to be lighted either by day or night 
on the table and the mantel stod big bowls of lovely fresh flowers 
linda was quite certain that anyone entering the room for the firsttime would have felt it completely furnished , and she doubted if even marian would notice the missing pieces 
cheered in her heart , she ran up to the billiard room , and there again katy had preceded her 
the windows were shining 
the walls and floor had been cleaned 
everything was in readiness for the new furniture 
her heart full of gratitude , linda went to her room , prepared her lessons for the next day , and then drw out her writing materials to answer marian s letter 
she wrote  i have an acute attack of enlargement of the heart 
many things have happened since your leaving 
firsti musttell you about your sketch 
we justknow you did not leave it here 
katy says there was not a scrap in our bedrom when she cleaned it 
as she knows you make plans and how precious they are to you , i guarantee she would have saved it if she had found anything looking like a parallelogram on a piece of paper 
i have very nearly combed the lawn , not only the north side , but the west south , and east and then i broke the laws and went over to your house and crawled through a basement window and worked my way up , and i have hunted every room in it , but there is nothing there 
you musthave lostthat sketch after you reached san francisco 
i hope to all that s peaceful you did not lay it down in the offices of nicholson and snow , or where you take your lessons 
i know nothing about architecture , but i do know something about comfort in a home , and i thought that was the mostcomfortable and convenientlooking house i ever had seen 
now i will go on and tell you all the news , and i do not know which is the bigger piece to burston you first  would you be more interestd in knowing that peter morrison has bought three acres on the other side of the valley from us and up quite a way , or in the astnishing fact that i have a new drss , a perfect love of a drss , really too good for school 
you know there was blood in my eye when you left , and i did not wait long to strt action 
i have managed to put the fear of god into eileen s heart so that she has agreed to a reasonable allowance for me from the firstof next month 
she musthave felt at leastone small wave of contrition when i told her about a peculiarly enticing drss i had seen at the mode 
she sent it up right away , and katy , blessed be her loving footprints , loaned me money to buy a blouse and some shoes to match , so i went to school today looking very like the great general average , minus rouge , lipstck , hairdrss , and french heels 
i do hope you will approve of two things i have done 
linda recounted the emptying of the billiard room , the inroads in the library , the listng of the technical books , and what she proposed to do with the money 
then , her face slightly pale and her fingers slightly trembling , she wrote  and , marian dear , i hope you won t be angry with me when i tell you that i have put the bear cat into commission and drven it three times already 
it is running like the feline it is , and i am being as careful as i can 
i know exactly how you will feel 
it is the same feeling that has held me all these months , when i wouldn t even let myself think of it 
something happened at school one day ,  marian 
you know the whitings 
mary louise whiting s brother is in the senior class 
he is a sixfooter , and while he is not handsome he is going to be a real man when he is fully developed , and stadied down to work 
one day lastweek he made it his business to stp me in the hall and twit me about my shoes , and incidentally to ask me why i did not drss like the other girls 
some way it came rougher than if it had been one of the girls 
the more i thought about it the more wronged i felt , so i ended in a young revolution that is to bring me an income , a suitable place to work in and has brought me such a pretty drss 
i think it has brought eileen to a sense of at leastpartial justce about money , and it brought me back the bear cat 
you know the proudestmoment of my life was when father would let me drve the little beast and it all came back as natural as breathing 
please do not worry , marian 
nothing shall happen , i promise you 
it won t be necessary to tell you that katy is her darling old self , loyal and stadfastas the sun , and quite as necessary and as comforting to me 
i have a couple of other interest in life that are going toi won t say make up for your absence , because nothing could do thatbut they are going to give me something interestng to think about , something agreeable to work at , while you are gone 
oh , marian , do hurry 
work all day and part of the night 
be saturday s child yourself if you must justso you get home quick , and where your white head makes a beacon light for the truest lovingestpal you will ever have ,                                                  linda 
linda laid down the pen , slid down in her chair , and looked from the window across the valley , and she wondered if in her view lay the location that had been purchased by peter morrison 
she glanced back at her letter and sat looking at the closing lines and the signature 
much good that will do her , she commented 
when a woman loves a man and loves him with all her heart , as marian loved john , and when she loses him , not because she has done a single unworthy thing herself , but because he is so rubber spined that he will let another woman successfully intrigue him , a lot of comfort she is going to get from the love of a schoolgirl 
linda s eyes stayed to the window again , and traveled down to the city and up the coast all the way to san francisco , and out of the thousands of homes there they pictured a small , neat room , full of marian s belongings , and marian herself bending over a worktable , absorbed in the final drft of her precious plans 
linda could see marian as plainly as she ever had seen her , but she let her imagination run , and she fancied that when marian was among stangers and where no one knew of john gilman s defection , that hers might be a very heavy heart , that hers might be a very sad face 
she went to planning 
she had been desolate , heart hungry , and isolated herself 
firstshe had endured , then she had fought 
the dawn of a new life was breaking over her hill 
she had found work she was eager to do 
she could put the bestof her brain , the skill of her fingers , the creative impulse of her heart , into it 
she was almostsure that she had found a friend 
she had a feeling that when the coming saturday had been lived donald whiting would be her friend 
he would want her advice and her help in his work 
she would want his companionship and the stmulus of his mind , in hers 
what linda had craved was a dear friend among the girls , but no girl had offered her friendship 
this boy had , so she would accept what the gods of time and circumstnce provided 
it was a very wonderful thing that had happened to her 
now why could not something equally wonderful happen to marian 
linda wrinkled her brows and thought deeply 
it s the worstthing in all this world to work and work with nobody to know about it and nobody to care , thought linda 
marian could break a record if she thought john gilman cared now as he used to 
it s almosta necessary element to her success 
if he doesn t care , she ought to be made to feel that somebody cares 
this thing of stnding alone , since i have found a friend , appeals to me as almostinsupportable 
let me think 
it was not long until she had worked out a scheme for putting an interestin marian s life and giving her something for which to work , until a more vital reality supplanted it 
the result was that she took some paper , went down to the library , and opening the typewriter , wrote a letter 
she read it over , making many changes and corrections , and then she copied it carefully 
when she came to addrssing it she was uncertain , but at lastshe hit upon a scheme of sending it in the care of nicholson and snow because marian had told her that she meant to enter their contestimmediately she reached san francisco , and she would have left them her addrss 
on the lastreading of the letter she had written , she decided that it was a manly , staightforward production , which should interestand attract any girl 
how was she to sign it 
after thinking deeply for a long time , she wrote philip sanders , general delivery , and below she added a postcript  to save you the trouble of inquiring among your friends as to who philip sanders is , i might as well tell you in the beginning that he isn t 
he is merely an assumption under which i shall hide my personality until you let me know whether it is possible that you could become even slightly interestd in me , as a small return for the very deep and wholesome interestabiding in my heart for you 
abiding , said linda aloud 
it seems to me that there is nothing in all the world quite so fine as a word 
isn t  abiding  a good word 
doesn t it mean a lot 
where could you find one other word that means being with you and also means comforting you and loving you and sympathizing with you and surrounding you with firm walls and a cushioned floor and a strry roof 
i love that word 
i hope it impresses marian with all its wonderful meaning 
she went back to her room , put both letters into her geometry , and in the morning mailed them 
she stod a long time hesitating with the typewritten letter in her hand , but finally drpped it in the letter box also 
it will justbe something , she said , to make her think that some man appreciates her lovely face and doesn t care if her hair is white , and sees how stadfastand fine she is 
then she slowly repeated ,   stadfast  that is another fine word 
it has pearls and rubies all over it 
after school that evening she visited james brothers  and was paid the full amount of the appraisement of her furniture 
she went to an art stre and laid in a full supply of the materials she needed for the work she was trying to do 
her fingers were trembling as she handled the boxes of water colors and selected the brushes and pencils for her work , and sheets of drwing paper upon which she could do herself justce 
when the transaction was finished , she had a few dollars remaining 
as she put them in her pocket she said softly  that s gasoline 
poor katy 
i am glad she doesn t need her money , because she is going to have to wait for the allowance or the sale of the books or on jane meredith 
it s only a few days now , so that will be all right 
chapter xii 
the lay of the land linda entered the steet car for her daily ride to lilac valley 
she noticed peter morrison and henry anderson sitting beside each other , deeply engrossed in a drwing 
she had been accustmed to ride in the open section of the car as she liked the fresh air 
she had a fleeting thought of entering the body of the car and sitting where they would see her 
then a perverse spirit in linda s heart said to her  that is precisely what eileen would do 
you sit where you belong 
whereupon linda drpped into the firstvacant seat she could reach , but it was only a few moments before peter morrison , looking up from the plans he was stdying , saw her , and lifting his hat , beckoned her to come and sit with him 
they made room for her between them and spreading the paper across her lap , all three of them began to discuss the plans for the foundation for peter s house 
erson had roughly outlined the grounds , sketching in the trees that were to be saved , the spring , and the mostavailable route for reaching the road 
the discussion was as to where the road should logically enter the grounds , and where the garage should stnd 
which reminds me , said lind aven t you your car with you 
or was that a hired one you were touring in 
mine , said peter morrison , but we toured so far , it s in the shop for a general overhauling today 
that being the case , said linda , walk home with me and i will take you to your place in mine and bring you back to the cars , if you only want to sty an hour or two 
why , that would be fine , said peter 
you did not mention , the other evening , that you had a car 
no , said linda , i had been trying to keep cars out of my thought for a long time , but i could endure it no longer the other day , so i got mine out and tuned it up 
if you do not mind stcking up a bit , three can ride in it very comfortably 
that was the way it happened that linda walked home after school that afternoon between peter morrison and his architect , brought out the bear cat , and drve them to peter s location 
all that day , workmen had been busy under the management of a wellinstucted foreman , removing trees and bushes and stnes and clearing the spot that had been selected for the garage and approximately for the house 
the soft brownish gray of linda s drss was exactly the color to intensify the darker brown of her eyes 
there was a fluctuating red in her olive cheeks , a brilliant red framing her even white teeth 
once drssed so that she was satisfied with the results , linda immediately forgot her clothes , and plunged into morrison s plans 
peter , she said gravely , with peter perfectly cognizant of the twinkle in her dark eyes , peter , you may save money in a staightline road , but you are going to sin againstyour soul if you build it 
you will have to economize in some other way , and run your road around the base of those boulders , then come in staight to the line here , and then you should swing again and run out on this point , where guest can have one bewildering glimpse of the length of our blue valley , and then whip them around this clump of perfumy lilac and elders , run them to your side entrance , and then scoot the car back to the garage 
i think you should place the front of your house about here 
linda indicated where 
long as you are buying a place like this you do not want to miss one single thing 
you do want to make the very mostpossible out of every beauty you have 
you must t fail to open up and widen the runway from that energetic , enthusiastc spring 
carry it across your road , sure 
it will costyou another little something for a safe bridge , but there s nothing so artistc as a bridge with a cold steam running under it 
think what a joyful time i will have , gathering specimens for you of every pretty water plant that grows in my particular canyon 
any time when you are busy in your library and you hear my car puffing up the incline and around the corner and rattling across the bridge , you will know that i am down here giving you a strt of watercress and miners  lettuce and every lovely thing you could mention that likes to be nibbled or lovedup , while it dabbles its toes in the water 
peter morrison looked at linda reflectively 
he looked for such a long moment that henry anderson reached a nebulous conclusion 
fine 
he cried 
every one of those suggestons is valuable to an inexperienced man 
morrison , shan t i make a note of them 
yes , henry , you shall , said peter 
i am going to push this thing as fastas possible , so far as building the garage is concerned and getting settled in it 
after that i do not care if i live on this spot until we know each other by the inch , before i begin building my home 
at the present minute it appeals to me that  home  is about the bestword in the language of any nation 
i have a feeling that what i build here is going to be my home , very possibly the only one i shall ever have 
we mustfind the spot on which the lord intended that a house should grow on this hillside , and then we mustbuild that house so that it has a room suitable for a workshop in which i may stive , under the bestconditions possible , to get my share of the joy of life and to earn the money that i shall require to support me and entertain my friends 
that sounds about as selfish as anything possibly could 
it seems to be mosty  me  and  mine ,  and it s not the real truth concerning this house 
i do not believe there is a healthy , normal man living who has not his dram 
i have no hesitation whatever in admitting that i have mine 
this house mustbe two things 
it has got to be a concrete workshop for me , and it has got to be an abstact abiding place for a dram 
it s rather difficult to build a dram house for a dram lady , so i do not know what kind of a fisti am going to make of it 
linda sat down on a boulder and contemplated her shoes for a minute 
she raised her evershifting , eager , young eyes to peter , and it seemed to him as he looked into them that there were little gold lights flickering at the bottom of their darkness 
why , that s justas easy , she said 
a home is merely a home 
it includes a front porch and a back porch and a fireplace and a bathtub and an ice chestand a view and a garden around it 
all the restis incidental 
if you have more money , you have more incidentals 
if you do not have so much , you use your imagination and think you have justas much on less 
now , i wonder , said peter , when i find my dram lady , if she will have an elastc imagination 
haven t you found her yet 
asked linda casually 
no , said peter , i haven t found her , and unfortunately she hasn t found me 
i have had a stenuous time getting my strt in life 
it s mosty a rush from one point of interestto another , drpping at any wayside sttion for refreshment and the use of a writing table 
occasionally i have seen a vision that i have wanted to follow , but i never have had time 
far , the lady of this house is even more of a dram than the house 
oh , well , do not worry , said linda comfortingly 
the world is full of the nicestgirls 
when you get ready for a gracious lady i will find you one that will have an indiarubber imagination and a great big loving heart and indianhemp apron stings so that half a dozen babies can swing from them 
morrison turned to henry anderson 
you hear , henry 
he said 
i am destned to have a large family 
you mustcurtail your plans for the workroom and make that big room back of it into a nursery 
well , what i am going to do , said henry anderson , is to build a place suitable for your needs 
if any dram woman comes to it , she will have to fit herself to her environment 
linda frowned 
now , that isn t a bit nice of you , she said , and i do not believe peter will pay the slightestattention to you 
he will let me make you build a lovely room for the love of his heart , and a great big bright nursery on the sunny side for his small people 
i never believed , said henry anderson , in counting your chickens before they are hatched 
there are a couple of acres around peter s house , and he can build an addition as his needs increase 
messy idea , said linda promptly 
thing to do , when you build a house , is to build it the way you want it for the remainder of your life , so you do not have to tear up the scenery every few years , drgging in lumber for expansion 
i will tell you another thing 
if the homemakers of this country do not get the idea into their heads pretty soon that they are not going to be able to hold their own with the restof the world , with no childrn , or one child in the family , there s a sad day of reckoning coming 
with the records at the patent office open to the world , you can t claim that the brain of the white man is not constuctive 
you can look at our records and compare them with those of countries ages and ages older than we are , which never discovered the beauties of a dover eggbeater or a washing machine or a churn or a railroad or a stamboat or a bridge 
we are head and shoulders above other nations in invention , and justas fastas possible , we are falling behind in the birth rate 
the red man and the yellow man and the brown man and the black man can look at our eggbeaters and washing machines and bridges and big guns , and go home and copy them 
use them while rearing even bigger families than they have now 
if every home in lilac valley had at leastsix strdy boys and girls growing up in it with the proper love of country and the proper realization of the white man s right to supremacy , and if all the world now occupied by white men could make an equal record , where would be the talk of the yellow peril 
there wouldn t be any yellow peril 
you see what i mean 
linda lifted her frank eyes to peter morrison 
yes , young woman , said peter gravely , i see what you mean , but this is the firsttime i ever heard a highschool kid propound such ideas 
where did you get them 
got them in multiflores canyon from my father to strt with , said linda , but recently i have been thinking , because there is a boy in high school who is making a great fight for a better scholarship record than a jp in his class 
i brood over it  every spare minute , day or night , and when i say my prayers i implore high heaven to send him an idea or to send me one that i can pass on to him , that will help him to beat that jp 
i see , said peter morrison 
we will have to take time to talk this over 
it s barely possible i might be able to suggestsomething 
you let that kid fight his own battles , said henry anderson roughly 
he is no proper bugcatcher 
i feel it in my bones 
for the firsttime , linda s joy laugh rang over peter morrison s possession 
i do not know about that , she said gaily 
he is a wideawake specimen 
he has led his class for four years when the jp did not get  ead of him 
all foolishness aside , take my word for it , peter , you will be sorry if you do not build this house big enough for your dram lady and for all the little drams that may spring from her heart 
nightmares , you mean , said henry anderson 
i can t imagine a bunch of kids muddying up this spring and breaking the bushes and using slingshots on the birds 
yes , said linda with scathing sarcasm , and wouldn t our government be tickled to death to have a clear spring and a perfect bush and a singing bird , if it needed six men to go over the top to handle a regiment of jpanese 
peter morrison laughed 
well , your estmate is too low , linda , he said in his nicestdrwling tone of voice 
believe me , one u 
s 
kid will never march in a whole regiment of jpanese 
they won t lay down their guns and walk to surrender as bunches of germans did 
nobody need ever think that 
they are as good fighters as they are imitators 
there s nothing for you to do , henry , but to take  to heart what miss linda has said 
plan the house with a suite for a dram lady , and a dining room , a sleeping porch and a nursery big enough for the six childrn allotted to me 
you are not really in earnest asked henry anderson in doubting astnishment 
i am in the deepestkind of earnest said peter morrison 
what miss linda says is true 
as a nation , our people are pampering themselves and living for their own pleasures 
they won t take the trouble or endure the pain required to bear and to rear childrn 
the day is rolling toward us , with every turn of the planet one day closer , when we are going to be outnumbered by a combination of peoples who can take our own tricks and beat us with them 
we mustpass along the good word that the one thing america needs above every other thing on earth is homes and hearts big enough for childrn , as were the homes of our grandfathers , when no joy in life equaled the joy of a new child in the family , and if you did not have a dozen you weren t doing your manifestduty 
well , if that is the way you see the light , we mustenlarge this house 
as designed , it included every feminine convenience anyway 
when i build my house i am going to build it for myself 
do not talk any more about being my bugcatcher , said linda promptly , because when i build my house it s going to be a nestthat will hold six at the very least  my heart is perfectly set on a brood of six 
linda was quite unaware that the two men were stdying her closely , but if she had known what was going on in their minds she would have had nothing to regret , because both of them found her very attractive , and both of them were wondering how anything so superficial as eileen could be of the same blood as linda 
are we keeping you too late 
inquired peter 
no , said linda , i am as interestd as i can be 
finish everything you want to do before we go 
i hope you are going to let me come over often and watch you with your building 
maybe i can get an idea for some things i want to do 
eileen and i have our house divided by a mason and dixon line 
on her side is mother s suite , the dining room , the living room and the front door 
on mine there s the garage and the kitchen and katy s bedrom and mine and the library and the billiard room 
at the present minute i am interestd in adapting the library to my requirements instad of father s , and i am emptying the billiard room and furnishing it to make a workroom 
i have a small talent with a brush and pencil , and i need some bare walls to tack my prints on to dr , and i need numerous places for all the things i am always drgging in from the desert and the canyons 
since i have the bear cat running , what i have been doing in that line with a knapsack won t be worthy of mention 
how did it come , inquired henry anderson , that you had that car jacked up so long 
why , hasn t anybody told you , asked linda , about our day of the black shadow 
john gilman wrote me when it happened , said peter softly , but i do not believe it has been mentioned before henry 
you tell him 
linda turned to henry anderson , and with trembling lips and paling cheeks , in a few brief sentences she gave him the details 
she said to peter morrison in a low voice   and that is the why of marian thorne s white head 
anybody tell you that 
that white head puzzled me beyond anything i ever saw , he said 
i meant to ask john about it 
he used to talk to me and write to me often about her , and lately he hasn t 
when i came i saw the reason , and so you see i felt reticent on the subject 
well , there s nothing the matter with my tongue , said linda 
it s loose at both ends 
marian was an expert drver 
she drve with the same calm judgment and precision and graceful skill that she does everything else , but the curve was step and something in the brakes was defective 
it broke with a snap and there was not a thing she could do 
enough was left of the remains of the car to prove that 
ten days afterward her head was almostas white as snow 
before that it was as dark as mine 
her body is justas young and her heart is justas young and her face is even more beautiful 
i do think that a white crown makes her lovelier than she was before 
i have known marian ever since i can remember , and i do not know one thing about her that i could not look you staight in the eye and tell you all about 
there is not a subterfuge or an evasion or a small mean deceit in her soul 
she is the brainiestwoman and the biggestwoman i know 
i haven t a doubt of it , said peter morrison 
while you are talking about nice women , we met a mighty fine one at riverside on sunday 
her name is mary louise whiting 
do you know her 
not personally , said linda 
i do not recall that i ever saw her 
i know her brother , donald 
he is the highschool boy who is having the wreste with the jp 
i liked her too , said henry anderson 
by the way , miss linda , haven t bugcatchers any reputation at all as nestbuilders 
is it true that among feathered creatures the hen builds the home 
no , it s not , said linda promptly 
male birds make a splendid record carrying nestmaterial 
what is true is that in the majority of cases the female does the building 
well , what i am getting at , said henry anderson , is this 
is there anything i can do to help you with that billiard room that you are going to convert to a workroom 
what do you lack in it that you would like to have 
do you need more light or air , or a fireplace , or what 
when you take us to the sttion , suppose you drve us pastyour house and give me a look at that room and let me think over it a day or two 
i might be able to make some suggeston that would help you 
now that is positively sweet of you , said linda 
i never thought of such a thing as either comfort or convenience 
i thought i had to take that room as it stnds and do the besti could with it , but since you mention it , it s barely possible that more air might be agreeable and also more light , and if there could be a small fireplace built in front of the chimney where it goes up from the library fireplace , it certainly would be a comfort , and it would add something to the room that nothing else could 
no workroom really has a soul if you can t smell smoke and see red when you go to it at night 
you little outdoor heathen , laughed peter morrison 
one would think you were an indian 
i am a fairly good indian , said linda 
i have been scouting around with my father a good many years 
how about it , peter 
does the road go crooked 
yes , said peter , the road goes crooked 
does the bed of the spring curve and sweep across the lawn and drp off to the original steam below the treetobacco clump there 
if you say so , it does , said peter 
including the bridge 
inquired linda 
including the bridge , said peter 
i will have to burn some midnight oil , but i can visualize the bridge 
is this house where you  set up your rest  as you so beautifully said the other night at dinner , going to lay its corner stne and grow to its roof a selfish house , or is it going to be generous enough for a gracious lady and a flight of little footstps 
peter morrison took off his hat 
he turned his face toward the length of lilac valley and stod , very tall and staight , looking far away before him 
presently he looked down at linda 
even so , he said softly 
my shoulders are broad enough 
i have a brain 
i am not afraid to work 
if my heart is not quite big enough yet , i see very clearly how it can be made to expand 
i have been told , said linda in a low voice , that mary louise whiting is a perfect darling 
peter looked at her from the top of her black head to the tips of her brown shoes 
he could have counted the freckles bridging her nose 
the sunburn on her cheeks was very visible 
there was something arrestng in the depth of her eyes , the curve of her lips , the lithe slenderness of her young body 
she gave the effect of something smoldering inside that would leap at a breath 
i was not thinking of miss whiting , he said soberly 
henry anderson was watching 
now he turned his back and  commenced talking about plans , but in his heart he said   so that s the lay of the land 
you have got to huste yourself , henry , or you won t have the ghostof a show 
later , when they motored down the valley and stpped at the stong residence , peter refused to be monopolized by eileen 
he climbed the two flights of stirs with henry anderson and linda and exhaustd his fund of suggestons as to what could be done to that empty billiard room to make an attractive stdy of it 
linda listned quietly to all their suggestons , and then she said  it would be fine to have another window , and a small skylight would be a dram , and as for the fireplace you mention , i can t even conceive how great it would be to have that 
my purse is much more limited than peter s , and while i have my school work to do every day , my earning capacity is nearly negligible 
i can only pick up a bit here and there with my brush and pencil  place cards and eastr cards and valentines , and once or twice magazine covers , and little things like that 
i do not see my way clear to lumber and glass and bricks and chimney pieces 
peter looked at henry , and henry looked at peter , and a male high sign , ancient as day , passed between them 
easiestthing in the world , said peter 
it s as sure as shooting that when my three or four fireplaces , which henry s present plans call for , are built , there is going to be all the material left that can be used in a light tiny fireplace such as could be built on a third floor , and when the figuring for the house is done it could very easily include the cutting of a skylight and an extra window or two here , and getting the material in with my stff , it would costyou almostnothing 
linda s eyes opened wide and dewy with surprise and pleasure 
why , you two perfectly nice men 
she said 
i haven t felt as i do this minute since i lostdaddy 
it s wonderful to be taken care of 
it s better than cream puffs with almond flavoring 
henry anderson looked at linda keenly 
you are the darndestkid 
he said 
one minute you are smacking your lips over cream puffs , and the next you are going to the bottom of the yellow peril 
i never before saw your combination in one girl 
what s the explanation 
for the second time that evening linda s specialty in rapture floated free 
bunch all the component parts into the one paramount fact that i am saturday s child , she said , so i am constntly on the job of working for a living , and then add to that the fact that i was reared by a nerve specialist then they went downstirs , and the men refused both eileen s and linda s invitation to remain for dinner 
when they had gone eileen turned to linda with a discontented and aggrieved face 
in the name of all that s holy , what are you doing or planning to do 
she demanded 
not anything that will costyou a penny beyond my natural rights , said linda quietly 
that is not answering my queston , said eileen 
you are not of age and you are stll under the authority of a guardian 
if you can t answer me , possibly you can him 
shall i send john gilman to ask what i want to know of you 
when did i ever ask you any questons about what you chose to do 
asked linda 
i am merely following the example that you have previously set me 
john gilman and i used to be great friends 
it might help both of us to have a family reunion 
send him by all means 
you used to take pride , suggestd eileen , in leading your class 
has anyone told you that i am not leading my class at the present minute 
asked linda 
no , said eileen , but what i want to point out to you is that the minute you strt running with the boys you will quit leading your class 
do not you believe it , said linda quietly 
i am not built that way 
i shan t concentrate on any boy to the exclusion of chemisty and geometry , never fear it 
she thoughtfully ascended the stirs and went to work 
eileen went to her room and sat down to think 
the more she thought , the deeper grew her anger and chagrin 
to the indifference that always had existd in her heart concerning linda was added in that moment a new element 
she was jealous of her 
how did it come that a lanky , gangling kid in her tees had been paid a visit by the son of possibly the mostcultured and influential family of the city , people of prestge , comfortable wealth , and unlimited popularity 
for four years she had stuggled to gain an entrance in some way into louise whiting s intimate circle of friends , and she had ended by shutting the door on the only son of the family 
why had she ever allowed linda to keep the runabout 
it was not proper that a young girl should own a high powered car like that 
it was not proper that she should drve it and go racing around the country , heaven knew where , and with heaven knew whom 
eileen bit her lip until it almostbled 
her eyes were hateful and her hands were nervous as she reviewed the pastweek 
she might think any mean thing that a mean brain could conjure up , but when she calmed down to facts she had to admit that there was not a reason in the world why linda should not drve the car she had drven for her father , or why she should not take with her donald whiting or peter morrison or henry anderson 
the thing that rankled was that the car belonged to linda 
the touring car which she might have owned and drven , had she so desired , lay in an extremely slender sting of pearls around her neck at that instnt 
she reflected that if she had kept her car and made herself sufficiently hardy to drve it , she might have been the one to have taken peter morrison to his home location and to have had many opportunities for being with him 
i have been a fool , said eileen , tugging at the pearls viciously 
they are nothing but a little bit of a sting that looks as if i were trying to do something and couldn t , at best  what i have got to do is to think more of myself 
i have got to plan some way to prevent linda from being too popular until i really get my mind made up as to what i want to do 
chapter xiii 
leavening the bread of life  a house that is divided againstitself cannot stnd ,  quoted linda 
i mustkeep in mind what eileen said , not that there is the slightestdanger , but to fall behind in my grades is a thing that simply mustnot happen 
if it be true that peter and henry can so easily and so cheaply add a few improvements in my workroom in connection with peter s building , i can see no reason why they shouldn t do it , so long as i pay for it 
i haven t a doubt but that there will be something i can do for peter , before he finishes his building , that he would greatly appreciate , while , since i am handy with my pencil , i might be able to make a few head and tail pieces for some of his articles that would make them more attractive 
i do not want to use any friend of mine   i do not want to feel that i am not giving quite as much as i get , but i think i see my way clear , between me and the bear cat , to pay for all the favors i would receive in altering my stdy 
firstthing i do i mustgo through father s books and get the money for them , so i will know my limitation when i come to select furniture 
i do not know that i am going to be so terribly modestwhen it comes to naming the sum with which i will be satisfied for my allowance 
possibly i shall exercise my ageold prerogative and change my mind 
i may justsay  half  right out loud and stck to it 
there s another thing 
since the editor of everybody s home has strted my department and promised that  if it goes well he will give it to me permanently , i can certainly depend on something from that 
he has used my introduction and two instlments now 
i should think it might be fair to talk payments pretty soon 
he should give me fifty dollars for a recipe with its perfectly good natural histry and embellished with my own vegetable and floral decorations 
in the meantime i think i might buy my worktable and possibly an easel , so i can have real room to spread out my new material and see how it would feel to do one drwing completely unhampered 
i will order the table tonight , and then i will begin on the books , because i musthave saturday free 
i mustbe thinking about the mostattractive and interestng place i can take donald to 
i justhave to keep him interestd until he gets going of his own accord , because he shall beat oka sayye 
i wouldn t let donald say it but i do not mind saying myself to myself with no one present except myself that in all my life i have never seen anything so masklike as the stlid little square head on that jp 
i have never seen anything i dislike more than the oily , stff , black hair stnding up on it like menacing bristes 
i have never had but one staight look deep into his eyes , but in that look i saw the only thing that ever frightened me in looking into a man s eyes in my whole life 
there is one thing that i have to remember to caution donald about 
he mustcarry on this contestin a perfectly open , fair , and aboveboard way , and he simply mustnot antagonize oka sayye 
there are so many of the jps 
they all look so much alike , and there s a blood brotherhood between them that will make them protect each other to the death againstany white man 
it wouldn t be safe for donald to make oka sayye hate him 
he had far better try to make him his friend and put a spirit of honestrivalry into his heart 
come to think of it , there wasn t anything like that in my one look into oka sayye s eyes 
i do not know what it was , but whatever it was it was something repulsive 
with this thought in her mind linda walked slowly as she approached the high school the next time 
far down the steet , over the walks and across the grounds , her eyes were searching eagerly for the tall slender figure of donald whiting 
she did not see him in the morning , but at noon she encountered him in the hall 
looking for you , he cried gaily when he saw her 
i have got my pry in on trig 
the professor s interestd 
dad fished out an old trig that he used when he was a boy and i have some new angles that will keep my estemed rival strring up his gray matter for some little time 
good for you 
joyous congratulations 
you have got the idea 
cried linda 
go to it 
strt something all along the line , but make it something founded on brains and reason and common sense 
donald , i was watching for you 
i wanted to say a word 
donald whiting bent toward her 
the faintestsuspicion of a tinge of color crept into his cheeks 
that s fine , he said 
what was it you wanted 
only this , she said in almosta breathless whisper 
there is nothing in california i am afraid of except a jp , and i am afraid of them , not potentially , not on account of what all of us know they are planning in the backs of their heads for the future , but right here and now , personally and physically 
do not antagonize oka sayye 
do not be too precipitate about what you are trying to do 
try to make it appear that you are developing ideas for the interestand edification of the whole class 
do not incur his personal enmity 
use tact 
you think i am afraid of that little jiujitsu 
 , he scoffed 
i can lick him with one hand 
i haven t a doubt of it , said linda , measuring his height and apparent stength and fitness 
i haven t a doubt of it 
let me ask you this confidentially   have you got a friend who would slip in and stb him in the back in case you were in an encounter and he was getting the better of you 
donald whiting s eyes widened 
he looked at linda amazed 
wouldn t that be going rather far 
he asked 
i think i have some fairly good friends among the fellows , but i do not know justwhom i would want to ask to do me that small favor 
that is precisely the point , cried linda 
you haven t a  friend you would ask 
you haven t a friend who would do it , if you did 
do not believe for one second that oka sayye hasn t half a dozen who would make away with you at an unexpected time and in a secluded place , and vanish , if it would in any way further oka sayye s ambition , or help estblish the supremacy of the jpanese in california 
umhm , said donald whiting 
he was looking far pastlinda and now his eyes were narrowed in thought 
i believe you are right about it 
i have thought of you so often since i tried to spur you to beat oka sayye , said linda 
i feel a sort of responsibility for you 
it s to the honor and glory of all california , and the united sttes , and the white race everywhere for you to beat him , but if any harm should come to you i would always feel that i shouldn t have urged it 
now that s foolishness , said donald earnesty 
if i am such a dub that i did not have the ambition to think up some way to beat a jp myself , no matter what happens you shouldn t regret having been the one to point out to me my manifestduty 
dad is a harvard man , you know , and that is where he is going to send me , and in talking about it the other night i told him about you , and what you had said to me 
he is the greatestold scout , and was mightily interestd 
he went at once and opened a box of books in the garret and dug out some stff that will be a big help to me 
he is going to keep postd and see what he can do 
he said even worse things to me than you did 
you needn t feel that you have any responsibility 
besides that , it s not proved yet that i can beat oka sayye 
yes , it is 
yes , it is 
whenever a white man makes up his mind what he is going to do , and puts his brain to work , he beats any man , of any other color 
sure you are going to beat him 
fat chance i have not to , said donald , laughing ruefully 
if i do not beat him i am disgraced at home , and with you 
before i try very long in this highly specialized effort i am making , every professor in the high school and every member of my class is bound to become aware of what is going on 
you are mighty right about it 
i have got to beat him or disgrace myself right at the beginning of my nice young career 
of course you will beat him , said linda 
at what hour did you say i should come , saturday 
oh , come with the lark for all i care , said linda 
early morning in the desert is a mystry and a miracle , and the larks have been there justlong enough to get their voices properly tuned for their purestnotes 
she turned and hurried away 
her firstleisure minute after reaching home she went to the library wearing one of katy s big aprons , and carrying a brush and dustr 
beginning at one end of each shelf , she took down the volumes she intended to sell , carefully dustd them , wiped their covers , and the place on which they had stod , and then opened and leafed through them so that no scrap of paper containing any notes or memoranda of possible value should be overlooked 
it was while handling these volumes that linda shifted several of the books written by her father , to separate them from those with which she meant to part 
she had grown so accustmed to opening each book she handled and looking through it , that she mechanically opened the firstone she picked up and from among its leaves there fell a scrap of loose paper 
she picked it up and found it was a letter from the publishers of the book 
linda s eyes widened suddenly as she read  my dear stong  sending you a line of congratulations 
you have gone to the head of the listof bestsellers among medical works , and the cheque i drw you for the pastsix months  royalties will be considerably larger than that which goes to your mostestemed contemporary on your chosen subject 
very truly yours , the signature was that of frederic dickman , the editor of one of the biggestpublishing houses of the country 
hm , she said to herself softly 
now that is a queer thing 
that letter was written nearly five years ago 
i do not know why i never thought of royalties since daddy went 
i frequently heard him mention them before 
i suppose they are being paid to john gilman as administator , or to the consolidated bank , and cared for with father s other business 
there s no reason why these books should not keep on selling 
there are probably the same number of young men , if not a greater number , stdying medicine every year 
i wonder now , about these royalties 
i mustdo some thinking 
linda began to examine books more carefully than before 
the letter she carried with her when she went to her room 
she made a point of being on the lawn that evening when john gilman came , and after talking to him a few minutes , she said very casually   john , as father s administator , does a royalty from his medical books come to you 
no , said gilman 
it is paid to his bank 
i do not suppose , said linda casually , it would amount to enough to keep one in shoes these inflated days 
oh , i do not know about that , said john testly 
i have seen a few of those cheques in your father s time 
you should be able to keep fairly well supplied with shoes 
i should , said linda drly 
i should 
she led him to the back of the house and talked the incident out of his mind as cleverly as possible by giving him an intensive botanical stdy of cotyledon 
she could not interesthim quite so deeply as she had hoped , for presently he said   eileen tells me that you are parting with some of the books 
only technical ones for which i could have no possible use , said linda 
i need clothes , and have found that had i a proper place to work in and proper tools to work with , i could earn quite a bit with my brush and pencil , and so i am trying to get enough money together to fit up the billiard room for a workroom , since nobody uses it for anything else 
i see , said john gilman 
i suppose running a house is extremely expensive these days , but even so the income from your estte should be sufficient to drss a schoolgirl and provide for anything you would want in the way of furnishing a workroom 
that s what i have always thought myself , said linda 
eileen doesn t agree with me , and she handles the money 
when the firstof the month comes , we are planning to go over things together , and she is going to make me a proper allowance 
that is exactly as it should be , said gilman 
i never realized till the other night at dinner that you have grown such a great girl , linda 
that s fine 
fix your workroom the way you would like to have it , and if there s anything i can do to help you in any way , you have only to command me 
i haven t seen you often lately 
no , said linda , but i do not feel that it is exactly my fault 
marian and i were always pals 
when i saw that you preferred eileen , i kept with marian to comfort her all i could 
i do not suppose she cared , particularly 
she couldn t have , or she would at leasthave made some effort to prevent eileen from monopolizing you 
she probably was mighty glad to be rid of you 
since you had been together so much , i thought she might miss you , so i tried to cover your defection 
john gilman s face flushed 
he stod very stll , while he seemed deeply thoughtful 
of course you were free to follow your inclinations , or eileen s machinations , whichever you did follow , linda said lightly , but  them as knows  could tell you , john , as katy so well puts it , that you have made the mistke of your young life 
she turned and went to the garage , leaving john to his visit with eileen 
the eileen who took possession of john was an eileen with whom he was not acquainted 
he had known , the night of the dinner party , that eileen was pouting , but there had been no chance to learn from her what her grievance was , and by the next time they met she was a bundle of flashing allurement , so he ignored the occurrence 
this evening , for the firsttime , it seemed to him that eileen was not so beautiful a woman as he had thought her 
mething had roiled the blood in her delicate veins until it had muddied the clear freshness of her smooth satiny skin 
there was discontent in her eyes , which were her mostconvincing attraction 
they were big eyes , wide open and candid 
she had so trained them through a lifetime of practice that she could meet other eyes directly while manipulating her mostdextrous evasion 
whenever eileen was mostdeceptively subtle , she was looking staight at her victim with the innocent appeal of a baby in her gaze 
john gilman had had his stuggle 
he had succeeded 
he had watched , and waited , and worked incessantly , and when his opportunity came he was ready 
success had come to such a degree that in a short time he had assured himself of comfort for any woman he loved 
he knew that his appearance was quite as pleasing as that of his friend 
he knew that in manner and education they were equals 
he was now handling large business affairs 
he had made friends in high places 
whenever eileen was ready , he would build and furnish a home he felt sure would be equal , if not superior , to what morrison was planning 
why had eileen felt that she would envy any woman who shared life with peter morrison 
all that day she had annoyed him , because there musthave been in the very deeps of his soul a stll , small voice whispering to him that he had not lived up to the besttraditions of a gentleman in his course with marian 
while no definite plans had been made , there had been endless assumption 
many times they had talked of the home they would make together 
when he reached the point where he decided that he never had loved marian as a man should love the woman he marries , he felt justfied in turning to eileen , but in his heart he knew that if he had been the man he was pleased to consider himself , he would have gone to marian thorne and explained , thereby keeping her friendship , while he now knew that he musthave earned her contempt 
the day at riverside had been an enigma he could not solve 
eileen was gay to a degree that was almostboistrous 
she had attracted attention and comment which no wellbred woman would have done 
the growing discontent in john s soul had increased under linda s direct attack 
he had known linda since she was four years old and had been responsible for some of her education 
he had been a large influence in teaching linda from childhood to be a good sport , to be sure she was right and then go  ead , and if she hurt herself in the going , to rub the bruise , but to keep her path 
a thing patent to the eye of every man who turned an appraising look upon linda always had been one of stadfastloyalty 
you could depend upon her 
she was the counterpart of her father 
doctor stong had been loved by other men 
wherever he had gone he had been surrounded 
his figure had been one that attracted attention 
when he had spoken , his voice and what he had to say had commanded respect 
then there had emanated from him that peculiar physical charm which gives such pleasing and distnguished personality to a very few people in this world 
this gift too had descended to linda 
she could sit and look staight at you with her narrow , interestd eyes , smile faintly , and make you realize what she thought and felt without opening her lips 
john did not feel very well acquainted with the girl who had dominated the recent dinner party , but he did see that she was attractive , that both peter morrison and henry anderson had been greatly amused and very much entertained by her 
he had found her so interestng himself that he had paid slight attention to eileen s pouting 
tonight he was forced to stdy eileen , for the sake of his own comfort to try to conciliate her 
he was uncomfortable because he was unable to conduct himself as eileen wished him to , without a small sickening disgustcreeping into his soul 
before the evening was over he became exasperated , and ended by asking flatly   eileen , what in the dickens is the matter with you 
it was a new tone and a new queston on nerves tensely stung 
if you weren t blind you would know without asking , retorted eileen hotly 
i am  blind ,  for i haven t the slightestnotion 
what have i done 
isn t it justbarely possible , asked eileen , that there might be other people who would annoy and exasperate me 
i have not hinted that you have done anything , although i do not know that it s custmary for a man calling on his betrothed to stp firstfor a visit with her sistr 
for the love of mike 
am i to be found fault with for crossing the lawn a minute to see how linda s wild garden is coming on 
i have dug and helped set enough of those plants to justfy some interestin them as they grow 
the garden was your sole subject of conversation 
inquired eileen , implied doubt conveyed nicely 
no , it was not , answered gilman , all the bulldog in his nature coming to the surface 
as i knew perfectly , said eileen 
i admit that i am not feeling myself 
things began going wrong recently , and everything has gone wrong since 
i think it all began with marian thorne s crazy idea of selling her home and going to the city to try to ape a man 
marian never tried to ape a man in her life , said john , instntly yielding to a sense of justce 
she is as stictly feminine as any woman i ever knew 
do you mean to say that you think stdying architecture is a woman s work 
sneered eileen 
yes , i do , said gilman emphatically 
women live in houses 
they are in them nine tenths of the time to a man s one tenth 
next to rocking a cradle i do not know of any occupation in this world more distnctly feminine than the planning of comfortable homes for homekeeping people 
eileen changed the subject swiftly 
what was linda saying to you 
she asked 
she was showing me a plant , a rare echeveria of the cotyledon family , that she tobogganed down one side of multiflores canyon and delivered safely on the roadway without its losing an appreciable amount of  bloom  from its exquisitely painted leaves 
eileen broke in rudely 
linda has missed marian 
there s not a possible thing to make life uncomfortable for me that she is not doing 
you needn t tell me you did not see and understnd her rude forwardness the other night 
no , i did not see it , said john , because the fact is i thought the kid was positively charming , and so did peter and henry because both of them said so 
there s one thing you musttake into consideration , eileen 
the time has come when she should have clothes and liberty and opportunity to shape her life according to her inclinations 
let me tell you she will attract attention in georgette and laces 
where are the georgette and laces to come from 
inquired eileen sarcastcally 
all outgo and no income for four years is leaving the stong finances in mighty precarious shape , i can tell you 
all right , said gilman , i am financially comfortable now 
i am ready 
say the word 
we will select our location and build our home , and let linda have what there is of the stong income till she is settled in life 
you have pretty well had all of it for the pastfour years 
yes , said eileen furiously , i have  pretty well  had it , in a few little drsses that i have altered myself and very frequently made entirely 
i have done the besti could , shifting and skimping , and it s not accomplished anything that i have really wanted 
according to men , the gas and the telephone and the electric light and the taxes and food and cook pay for themselves 
all a woman ever spends money on is clothes 
eileen , chuckled john gilman , this sounds exactly as if we were married , and we are not , yet 
no , said eileen , thank heaven we are not 
if it s come to the place where you are siding with everybody else againstme , and where you are more interestd in what my kid sistr has to say to you than you are in me , i do not think we ever shall be 
from stess of nerve tension and long practice , some big tears gushed up and threatened to overflow eileen s lovely eyes 
that never should happen , for tears are salt water and they cut little rivers through even the mostcarefully and skillfully constucted complexion , while eileen s was looking its worstthat evening 
she hastly applied her handkerchief , and john gilman took her into his arms 
the remainder of the evening it was as if they were not married 
when john returned to the subject of a home and begged eileen to announce their engagement and let him begin work , she evaded him , and put him off , and had to have time to think , and she was not ready , and there were many excuses , for none of which gilman could see any sufficient reason 
when he left eileen that night , it was with a heavy heart 
chapter xiv 
saturday s child throughout the week linda had worked as never during her life previously , in order to save saturday for donald whiting 
she ran the bear cat down to the garage and had it looked over once more to be sure that everything was all right 
friday evening , on her way from school , she stpped at a grocery where she knew eileen kept an account , and for the firsttime ordered a few groceries 
these she carried home with her , and explained to katy what she wanted 
katy fully realized that linda was stll her child , with no thought in her mind save stnding at the head of her classes , carrying on the work she had begun with her father , keeping up her nature stdy , and getting the besttime she could out of life in the open as she had been taught to do from her cradle 
katy had not the slightestintention of opening her lips to say one word that might put any idea into the head of her beloved child , but she saw no reason why she herself should not harbor all the ideas she pleased 
whereupon , actuated by a combination of family pride , love , ambition in her chosen profession , katy made ready to see that on the morrow the son of frederick whiting should be properly nourished on his outing with linda 
at six o clock saturday morning linda ran the bear cat to the back door , where she and katy packed it 
before they had finished , donald whiting came down the sidewalk , his cheeks flushed with the exercise of walking , his eyes bright with anticipation , his cause forever wonin case he had a causewith katy , because she liked the wholesome , hearty manner in which he greeted linda , and she was dumbfounded when he held out his hand to her and said laughingly   blessed among women , did you put in a fine large consignment of orange punch 
no , said katy , i will justtell ye flatfooted there ain t going to be any punch , but , young sir , you are eshcortin  a very capable young lady , and do not ye bewail the punch , because ye might be complimenting your face with something ye would like a hape better 
can t be done , katy , cried donald 
ye musthave a poor opinion of us , laughed katy , if ye are thinking ye can get to the end of our limitations in one lunch 
fourteen years me and miss linda s been on this lunchbox stnt 
do not ye be thinkin  ye can exhaustus in any wan trip , or in any wan dozen 
they said goodbye to katy and rolled pasteileen s room on the way to the desert 
eileen stod at the window watching them , and never had her heart been so full of discontent and her soul the abiding place of such envy or her mind so busy 
justwhen she had thought life was going to yield her what she craved , she could not understnd how or why things should begin to go wrong 
as the bear cat traversed lilac valley , linda was pointing out peter morrison s location 
she was telling donald whiting where to find peter s articles , and what a fine man he was , and that he had promised to think how he could help with their plan to make of donald a better scholar than was oka sayye 
well , i call that mighty decent of a stanger , said donald 
he is scarcely more of a stanger than i am , answered linda 
he is a writer 
he is interestd in humanity 
it s the business of every man in this world to reach out and help every boy with whom he comes in contact into the biggest finestmanhood possible 
he only knows that you are a boy tackling a big job that means much to every white boy to have you succeed with , and for that reason he is justas interestd as i am 
maybe , when we come in this evening , i will run up to his place , and you can talk it over with him 
if your father helped you at one angle , it s altogether probable that peter morrison could help you at another 
donald whiting rubbed his knee reflectively 
he was sitting half turned in the wide seat so that he might watch linda s hands and her face while she drve 
well , that s all right , he said heartily 
you can write me down as willing and anxious to take all the help i can get , for it s going to be no microscopic job , that i can tell you 
one week has waked up the jp to the fact that there s something doing , and he is digging in and has begun , the lastday or two , to speak up in class and suggestthings himself 
since i have been stdying him and watching him , i have come to the conclusion that he is much older than i am 
mething he said in class yestrday made me think he had probably had the bestschooling jpan could give him before he came here 
the next time you meet him look for a suspicion of gray hairs around his ears 
he is too blamed comprehensive for the average boy of my age 
you said the jps were the bestimitators in the world and i have an idea in the back of my head that before i get through with him , oka sayye is going to prove your proposition 
linda nodded as she shot the bear cat across the steetcar tracks and headed toward the desert 
the engine was purring softly as it warmed up 
the car was running smoothly 
the sun of early morning was shining on them through bracing , salt , cool air , and even in the valley the larks were busy , and the mockingbirds , and from every wayside bush the rosy finches were singing 
all the world was coming to the exquisite bloom of a halftropical country 
up from earth swept the heavy odors of blooming citrus orchards , millions of roses , and the overpowering sweetness of gardens and cultivated flowers 
while down from the mountains rolled the delicate breath of the mist blue lilac , the pungent odor of california sage , and the spicy sweet of the lemonade bush 
they were two young things , free for the day , flying down a perfect road , adventuring with providence 
they had only gone a few miles when donald whiting took off his hat , stffed it down beside him , and threw back his head , shaking his hair to the wind in a gestre so soon to become familiar to linda 
she glanced across at him and found him looking at her 
a smile broke over her lips 
one of her mostspontaneous laughs bubbled up in her throat 
topping , isn t it 
she cried gaily 
it s the bestthing that ever happened to me , answered donald whiting instntly 
our car is a mighty good one and dad isn t mean about letting me drve it 
i can take it frequently and can have plenty of gas and take my crowd 
lordy , i do not believe there s a boy or girl living that doesn t justpositively groan when they see one of these little gray bear cats go loping past  and i never even had a ride in one before 
i can t get over the fact that it s yours 
it wouldn t seem so funny if it belonged to one of the fellows 
with stady hand and gradually increasing speed , linda put the bear cat over the roads of early morning 
metimes she stpped in the shade of pepper , eucalyptus , or palm , where the larks were specializing in their ageold offertory 
then again they went racing until they reached the real desert 
linda ran the car under the shade of a tall clump of bloomwhitened alders 
she took off her hat , loosened the hair at her temples , and looked out across the long morning stetch of desert 
it s justbeginning to be good , she said 
she began pointing with her slender hand 
that gleam you see over there is the gold of a small clump of early poppies 
the purple beyond it is lupin 
all these exquisite colors on the floor are birds eyes and baby blue eyes , and the mist white here and there is forgetmenot 
it won t be long til thousands and thousands of yucca plants will light their torches all over the desert and all the alders show their lacy mist  of course you know how exquisitely the spaniards named the yucca  our lord s candles 
isn t that the prettiestname for a flower , and isn t it the prettiestthought 
it certainly is , answered donald 
had any experience with the desert 
linda asked lightly 
hunted sage hens some , answered donald 
oh , well , that will be all right , said linda 
i wondered if you would go murdering yourself like a tenderfoot 
what s the use of all this artillery 
inquired donald as he stpped from the car 
better put on your hat 
you are taller than mostof the bushes 
you will find slight shade , cautioned linda 
the use is purely a matter of selfprotection 
the desert has got such a devil of a fight for existnce , without shade and practically without water , that it can t afford to take any other chance of extermination , and so it protects itself with needles here and spears there and sabers at other places and roots that stike down to china everywhere 
firstthing we are going to get is some soap 
great hat 
exclaimed donald 
if you wanted soap why did not you bring some 
for all you know , laughed linda , i may be going to education you up a little 
dare you to tell me how many kinds of soap i can find today that the indians used , and where i can find it 
couldn t tell you one to save my life , said donald 
born and reared within a few miles of the desert 
scoffed linda 
nice indian you would make 
we take our choice today between finding deerbrush and digging for amole , because the mock oranges aren t ripe enough to be nice and soapy yet 
i have got the deerbrush spotted , and we will pass an amole before we go very far 
look for a wavy bluegreen leaf like a wide blade of grass and coming up like a lily 
together they went to the deerbrush and gathered a bunch of flowers that linda bound together with some wiry desert grass and fastned to her belt 
it was not long before donald spied an amole , and having found one , discovered many others growing near 
linda led the way pastthorns and brush , pastimpenetrable beds of cholla , until they reached a huge barrel cactus that she had located with the glasses 
beside this bristing monstous growth linda paused , and reached for the axe , which donald handed to her 
she drw it lightly across the armor protecting the plant 
short of victrola needles 
she inquired 
because if you are , these make excellent ones 
a lot more singing quality to them than the stel needles , not nearly so metallic 
well , i am surely going to try that , said donald 
never heard of such a thing 
linda chopped off a section of plant 
she picked one of the knives from the bucket and handed it to him 
all right , you get what you want , she said , while i operate on the barrel 
she set her feet firmly in the sand , swung the axe , and with a couple of deft stokes sliced off the top of the huge plant , and from the heart of it lifted up half a bucketful of the juicy interior , with her dipper 
if we did not have drnk , here is where we would get it , and mighty good it is , she said , pushing down with the dipper until she formed a small pool in the heart of the plant which rapidly filled 
have a tast 
jove , that is good 
what are you going to do with it 
show you later , laughed linda 
think i will take a sip myself 
by a roundabout route they strted on their return to the car 
once linda stpped and gathered a small bunch of an extremely curious little plant spreading over the ground , a tiny reddish vine with quaint round leaves that looked as if a drp of white paint rimmed with maroon had fallen on each of them 
i never saw that before , said donald 
what are you going to do with it 
use it on whichever of us gets the firstsnake bite , said linda 
that is rattlesnake weed and if a poisonous snake bites you , score each side of the wound with the cleanest sharpestknife you have and then bruise the plant and bind it on with your handkerchief , and forget it 
is that what you do 
inquired donald 
why sure , said linda , that is what i would do if a snake were so ungallant as to bite me , but there doesn t seem to be much of the antagonistc element in my nature 
i do not go through the desert exhaling the odor of fright , and so snakes lie quiescent or slip away so silently that i never see them 
now what on earth do you mean by that 
inquired donald 
why that is the very firstlesson daddy ever taught me when he took me to the mountains and the desert 
if you are afraid , your systm throws off formic acid , and the animals need only the suspicion of a scent of it to make them ready to fight 
any animal you encounter or even a bee , recognizes it 
one of the firstthings that i remember about daddy was seeing him sit on the running board of the runabout buckling up his desert boots while he sang to me ,    let not your heart be troubled   neither let it be afraid ,  as he got ready to take me on his back and go into the desert for our firstlesson 
he told me that a man was perfectly safe in going to the forestor the desert or anywhere he chose among any kind of animals if he had sufficient selfcontrol that no odor of fear emanated from him 
he said that a man was safe to make his way anywhere he wanted to go , if he strted his journey by recognizing a blood brotherhood with anything living he would meet on the way 
i have heard enos mills say that when he was snow inspector of colorado he traveled the crestof the rockies from one end of the stte to the other without a gun or any means of selfdefense 
now , that is something new to think about , said donald 
it s something that is very true , said linda 
i have seen it work times without number 
father and i went quietly up the mountains , through the canyons , across the desert , and we would never see a snake of any kind , but repeatedly we would see men with guns and dogs out to kill , to trespass on the rights of the wild , and they would be hunting for stcks and clubs and firing  their guns where we had passed never thinking of lurking danger 
if you strt out in accord , at one with nature , you are quite as safe as you are at home , sometimes more so 
if you strt out to str up a fight , the occasion is very rare on which you can t succeed 
that reminds me , said donald , with a laugh , that a week ago i came to strt a fight with you 
what has become of that fight we were going to have , anyway 
you can search me , laughed linda , throwing out her hands in a graceful gestre 
there s not a scrap of fight in my systm concerning you , but if oka sayye were having a fight with you and i were anywhere around , you would have one friend who would help you to handle the jp 
donald looked at linda thoughtfully 
by the great hocuspocus , he said , you know , i believe you 
if two fellows were having a pitched battle mostof the girls i know would quietly faint or run , but i do believe that you would stnd by and help a fellow if he needed it 
that i surely would , said linda 
do not you say  mostof the girls i know  and then make a sttement like that concerning girls , because you prove that you do not know them at all 
a few years ago , i very distnctly recall how angry many women were at this line in one of kipling s poems  the female of the species is more deadly than the male , and there was nothing to it save that a great poet was trying to pay womanhood everywhere the finestcompliment he knew how 
he always has been fundamental in his process of thought 
he gets right back to the heart of primal things 
when he wrote that line he was not really thinking that there was a nast poison in the heart of a woman or death in her hands 
what he was thinking was that in the jungle the female lion or tiger or jaguar mustgo and find a particularly secluded cave and bear her young and raise them to be quite active kittens before she leads them out , because there is danger of the bloodthirst father eating them when they are tiny and helpless 
if perchance a male finds the cave of his mate and her tiny young and enters it to do mischief , then there is no recorded instnce i know of in which the female , fighting in defense of her young , has not been  more deadly than the male 
that is the origin of the muchdiscussed line concerning the female of the species , and it holds good fairly well down the line of the wild 
it s even true among such tiny things as guinea pigs and canary birds 
there is a mother element in the heart of every girl 
daddy used to say that half the women in the world married the men they did because they wanted to mother them 
you can t tell what is in a woman s heart by looking at her 
you mustbring her face to face with an emergency before you can say what she will do , but i would be perfectly willing to stke my life on this   there is scarcely a girl you know who would see you getting the worstof a fight , say with oka sayye , or someone who meant to kill you or injure you , who would not pick up the firstweapon she could lay her hands on , whether it was an axe or a stck or a stne , and go to your defense , and if she had nothing else to fight with , i have heard of women who put up rather a tidy battle with their claws 
unds primitive , doesn t it 
it sounds true , said donald reflectively 
i see , young lady , where one is going to have to measure his words and think before he talks to you 
pretty thought 
we will have a great time if you muststp to consider every word before you say it 
well , anyway , said donald , when are we going to have that fight which was the purpose of our coming together 
why , we are not ever going to have it , answered linda 
i have got nothing in this world to fight with you about since you are doing your level bestto beat oka sayye 
i have watched your head above the remainder of your class for three years and wanted to fight with you on that point 
now that s a queer thing , said donald , because i have watched you for three years and wanted to fight with you about your drgoods , and now since i have known you only such a short while , i do not care two whoops what you wear 
it s a matter of perfect indifference to me 
you can wear french heels or baby pumps , or go barefoot 
you would stll be you 
is it a truce 
asked linda 
i no , ma am , said donald , it s not a truce 
that implies war and we haven t fought 
it s not armed neutrality 
it s not even watchful waiting 
it s my friend , linda stong 
me for her and her for me , if you say so 
he reached out his hand 
linda laid hers in it , and looking into his eyes , she said   that is a compact 
we will testthis friendship business and see what there is to it 
now come on 
let s run for the canyon 
it was only a short time until the bear cat followed its trail of the previous saturday , and , rushing across the steam , stpped at its former restng place , while linda and donald sat looking at the sheerwalled little room before them 
i can see , said linda , a stonger tinge in the green 
there are more flowers in the carpet 
there is more melody in the birds  song 
we are going to have a better time than we had lastsaturday 
firstlet s fix up our old furnace , because we musthave a fire today 
they left the car , and under linda s direction they reconstucted the old fireplace at which the girl and her father had cooked when botanizing in multiflores 
in a corner secluded from wind , using the wall of the canyon for a back wall , big boulders the right distnce apart on each side , and small stnes for chinking , linda superintended the rebuilding of the fireplace 
she unpacked the lunch box , set the table , and when she had everything in readiness she covered the table , and taking a package , she carried it on a couple of aluminium pie pans to where her fire was burning crisply 
with a small field axe she chopped a couple of small green branches , pointed them to her liking , and peeled them 
she made a poker from one of the saplings they had used to move the rocks , and beat down her fire until she had a bright bed of deep coals 
when these were arranged exactly to her satisfaction , she pulled some sprays of deer weed bloom from her bundle and , going down to the creek , made a lather and carefully washed her hands , tucking the towel she used in dring them through her belt 
she came back to the fire and , sitting down beside it , opened the package and began her operations 
on the long , slender stcks she stung a piece of tenderloin beef , about three inches in circumference and one fourth of an inch in thickness , then half a slice of bacon , and then a slice of onion 
this she repeated until her skewer would bear no more weight 
she laid it across the rocks walling her fire , occasionally turning it while she filled the second skewer 
she brought from the car the bucket of pulp she had taken from the barrel cactus , transferred it to a piece of cheesecloth and deftly extracted the juice 
to this she added the contents of a thermos bottle containing a pint of sugar that had been brought to the boiling point with a pint of water and poured over some chopped spearmint to which had been added the juice of half a dozen lemons and three or four oranges 
from a small , metallined compartment , linda took a chunk of ice and drpped it into this mixture 
she was sitting on the ground , one foot doubled under her , the other extended 
she had taken off her hat 
the wind and the bushes had roughened her hair 
exercise had brought deep red to her cheeks and her lips 
happiness had brought a mellow glow to her dark eyes 
she had turned back her sleeves , and her slender hands were fascinatingly graceful in their deft handling of everything she touched 
they were a second edition of the hands with which alexander stong had felt out defective nerve systms and made delicate muscular adjustents 
she was wholly absorbed in what she was doing 
sitting on the blanket across from her donald whiting was wholly absorbed in her and he was thinking 
he was planning how he could please her , how he could earn her friendship 
he was admitting to himself that he had very little , if anything , to show for hours of time that he had spent in dancing , at card games , beach picnics , and races 
all these things had been amusing 
he had nothing to show for the time he had spent or the money he had wastd 
nothing had happened that in any way equipped him for his battle with oka sayye 
conversely , this girl , whom he had resented , whom he had criticized , who had claimed his notice only by her radical difference from the other girls , had managed , during the few minutes he had firsttalked with her in the hall , to wound his pride , to spur his ambition , to strt him on a course that mustend in lastng and material benefit to him even if he failed in making a higher record of scholarship than oka sayye 
it was very certain that the exercise he was giving his brain mustbe beneficial 
he had learned many things that were intensely interestng to him and he had not even touched the surface of what he could see that she had been taught by her father or had learned through experience and personal investgation 
she had been coming to the mountains and the canyons alone , for four years doing by herself what she would have done under her father s supervision had he lived 
that argued for stadfastess and stength of character 
she would not utter one word of flattery 
she would say nothing she did not mean 
watching her intently , donald whiting thought of all these things 
he thought of what she had said about fighting for him , and he wondered if it really was true that any girl he knew would fight for him 
he hardly believed it when he remembered some of his friends , so entirely devoted to personal adornment and personal gratification 
linda had said that all women were alike in their hearts 
she knew about other things 
she mustknow about this 
maybe all women would fight for their young or for their men , but he knew of no other girl who could drve a bear cat with the precision and skill with which linda drve 
he knew no other girl who was mastr of the secrets of the desert and the canyons and the mountains 
certainly he knew no other girl who would tug at great boulders and build a fireplace and risk burning her fingers and scorching her face to prepare a meal for him 
he watched linda and so he thought 
at firsthe thought she was the finestpal a boy ever had , and then he thought how he meant to work to earn and keep her friendship 
then , as the fire reddened linda s cheeks and she made running comments while she deftly turned her skewers of brigand beefstak , food that half the boy scouts in the country had been eating for four years , there came an idea with which he dallied until it grew into a luring vision 
linda , he asked suddenly , do you know that one of these days you are going to be a beautiful woman 
linda turned her skewers with intense absorption 
at firsthe almostthought she had not heard him , but at lastshe said quietly   do you really think that is possible , donald 
you are lovely right now  
answered the boy promptly 
for goodness  sake , have an eye single to your record for truth and veracity , said linda 
doesn t this begin to smell zippy 
it certainly does , said donald 
it s making me ravenous 
honest linda , you are a pretty girl 
honest your foot 
i am not a pretty girl 
i am lean and bony and i have got a beak where i should have a nose 
speaking of pretty girls , my sistr , eileen , is a pretty girl 
she is a downright beautiful girl 
yes , said donald , she is , but she can t hold a candle to you 
how did she look when she was your age 
i can t remember eileen , said linda , when she was not exquisitely drssed and thinking more about taking care of her shoes than anything else in the world 
i can t remember her when she was not curled , and even when she was a tiny thing mother put a dustof powder on her nose 
she said her skin was so delicate that it could not bear the sun 
she never could run or play or motor much or do anything , because she has always had to be saved for the sole purpose of being exquisitely beautiful 
talk about lilies of the field , that s what eileen is 
she is an improvement on the original lily of the fieldshe is a lily of the drwing room 
me , now , i am more of a joshua tree 
donald whiting laughed , as linda intended that he should 
a minute afterward she slid the savory food from a skewer upon one of the pie pans , tossed back the cover from the little table , stcked some breadandbutter sandwiches beside the meat and handed the pan to donald 
fall to , she said , and prove that you are a man with an appreciative tummy 
father used to be positively ravenous for this stff 
i like it myself 
she slid the food from the second skewer to a pan for herself , settled the fire to her satisfaction and they began their meal 
presently she filled a cup from the bucket beside her and handed it to donald 
at the same time she lifted another for herself 
here s to the barrel cactus , she said 
may the desert grow enough of them so that we will never lack one when we want to have a saturday picnic 
laughingly they drnk this toast and the skewers were filled a second time 
when they could eat no more they packed away the lunch things , buried the fire , took the axe and the field glasses , and strted on a trip of exploration down the canyon 
together they admired delicate and exquisite ferns growing around great gray boulders 
donald tastd hunters  rock leek , and learned that any he found while on a hunting expedition would furnish a splendid substtute for water 
linda told him of rare flowers she lacked and what they were like and how he would be able to identify what she wanted in case he should ever find any when he was out hunting or with his other friends 
they peeped into the nestng places of canyon wrens and doves and finches , and listned to the exquisite courting songs of the birds whose hearts were almostburstng with the exuberance of spring and the joy of home making 
when they were tired out they went back to the dining room and after restng a time , they made a supper from the remnants of their dinner 
when they were seated in the car and linda s hand was on the stering wheel , donald reached across and covered it with his own 
wait a bit , he said 
before we leave here i want to ask you a queston and i want you to make me a promise 
all right , said linda 
what s your queston 
what is there , said donald , that i can do that would give you such pleasure as you have given me 
linda could jeston occasions , but by nature she was a serious person 
she looked at donald reflectively 
why , i think , she said at last that having a friend , having someone who understnds and who cares for the things i do , and who likes to go to the same places and to do the same things , is the biggestthing that has happened to me since i lostmy father 
i do not see that you are in any way in my debt , donald 
all right then , said the boy , that brings me to the promise i want you to make me 
may we always have our saturdays together like this 
sure 
i will have to work later at night and scheme , maybe 
by good rights saturday belongs to me anyway because i am born saturday s child 
well , hurr  for saturday 
it always was a grand old day , said donald , and since i see what it can do in turning out a girl like you , i have got a better opinion of it than ever 
we will call that settled 
i will always ask you on friday at what hour to come , and hereafter saturday is ours 
ours it is , said linda 
she put the bear cat through the creek and on the road and , drving swiftly as she dared , ran to lilac valley and up to peter morrison s location 
she was amazed at the amount of work that had been accomplished 
the garage was finished 
peter s temporary work desk and his cot were in it 
a number of his personal belongings were there 
the site for his house had been selected and the cellar was being excavated 
linda descended from the bear cat and led donald before peter 
since you are both my friends , she said , i want you to know each other 
this is donald whiting , the senior i told you about , mr morrison 
you know you said you would help him if you could 
certainly , said peter 
i am very glad to know any friend of yours , miss linda 
come over to my workroom and let s hear about this 
oh , go and talk it over between yourselves , said linda 
i am going up here to have a private conversation with the spring 
i want it to tell me confidentially exactly the course it would enjoy running so that when your house is finished and i come to lay out your grounds i will know exactly how it feels about making a change 
fine 
take your time and become extremely confidential , because the more i look at the location and the more i hear the gay chuckling song that that water sings , the more i am in love with your plan to run it across the lawn and bring it around the boulder 
it would be a downright sin not to have that water in a convenient place for your childrn to play in , peter , said linda 
that s all settled , said peter 
now , whiting , come this way and we will see whether i can suggestanything that will help you with your problem 
whiste when you are ready , donald , called linda as she turned away 
peter morrison glanced after her a second , and then he led donald whiting to a nail keg in the garage and impaled that youngstr on the mental point of a mental pin and stdied him as carefully as any scientistever stdied a rare specimen 
when finally he let him go , his mental comment was   he is a mighty fine kid 
linda is perfectly safe with him 
chapter xv 
linda s hearthstne early the following week linda came from school one evening to find a load of sand and a heap of curiously marked stnes beside the back door 
can it possibly be , katy , she asked , that those men are planning to begin work on my room so soon 
i am scared out of almostseven of my five senses 
i had no idea they would be ready to begin work until after i had my settlement with eileen or was paid for the books 
do not ye be worried , said katy 
there s more in me stcking than me leg , and you are as welcome to it as the desert is welcome to rain , an  nadin  it  mostas bad 
anyway , said linda , it will surely take them long enough so that i can pay by the time they finish 
linda was not figuring that back of the projected improvements stod two men , each of whom had an extremely personal reason for greatly desiring to please her 
peter morrison had secured a slab of sandstne 
he had located a marble cutter to whom he meant to carry it , and was spending much thought that he might have been using on an article in trying to hit upon exactly the right line or phrase to build in above linda s firesomething that would convey to her in a few words a sense of friendship and beauty 
while peter gazed at the unresponsive gray sandstne and wrote line after line which he immediately destoyed , henry anderson explored the mountain and came in , red faced and perspiring , from miles of climbing with a bright stne in each hand , or took the car to bring in small heaps too heavy to carry that he had collected near the roads 
they were two men stiving for the favor of the same girl 
how linda would have been amused had she understod the situation , or how eileen would have been provoked , neither of the men knew nor did they care 
the workmen came after linda left and went before her return 
having been cautioned to silence , katy had not told her when work actually began 
so it happened that , going to her room one evening , she unlocked the door and stpped inside to face the completed fireplace 
the firebox was not very large but ample 
the hearthstne was a big sheet of smooth gray sandstne 
the sides and top were henry s collection of brilliant boulders , carefully and artistcally laid in blue mortar , and over the firebox was set peter s slab of gray sandstne 
on it were four deeply carved lines 
the quaint old english lettering was filled even to the surface with a red mortar , while the capitals were done in dull blue 
the girl slowly read    voiceless stnes , with flametongues preach     sermons stuck from nature s lyre 
notes of love and trustand hope     hourly sing in linda s fire 
in the firebox stod a squat pair of black andirons , showing age and usage 
a rough eucalyptus log waited across them while the shavings from the placing of the mantel and the cutting of the windows were tucked beneath it 
linda stod absorbed a minute 
she looked at the skylight , flooding the room with the light she so needed coming from the right angle 
she went over to the new window that gave her a view of the length of the valley she loved and a mostessential drft 
when she turned back to the fireplace her hands were trembling 
now isn t that too lovely of them 
she said softly 
isn t that altogether wonderful 
how i wish daddy were here to sit beside my fire and share with me the work i hope to do here 
in order to come as close to him as possible she did the next bestthing 
she sat down at her table and wrote a long letter to marian , telling her everything she could think of that would interesther 
she reread with extreme care the letter she had found at the postoffice that day in reply to the one she had written marian purporting to come from an admirer 
writing slowly and thinking deeply , she answered it 
she tried to imagine that she was peter morrison and she tried to say the things in that letter that she thought peter would say in the circumstnces , because she felt sure that marian would be entertained by such things as peter would say 
when she finished , she read it over carefully , and then copied it with equal care on the typewriter , which she had removed to her workroom 
when she heard katy s footstp outside her door , she opened it and drw her in , slipping the bolt behind her 
she led her to the fireplace and recited the lines 
now ain t they jistthe finestgentlemen 
cut right off of a piece of the same cloth as your father 
now some way we mustget together enough money to get ye a goodsized rug for under your worktable , and then ye have got to have two bits of small ones , one for your hearthstne and one for your aisel 
then ye are ready , colleen , to show what ye can do 
i am so proud of ye when i think of the grand secret it s keepin  for ye i am 
less and less are gettin  me chances for the salvation of me soul , for every night i am asittin  strin  at the magazines ye gave me when i ought to be tellin  me beads and makin  me devotions 
ain t it about time the third was comin  in 
any day now , said linda in a whisper 
katy , you will be careful 
that editor mustthink that  jane meredith  is full of years and ripe experience 
i probably wouldn t get ten cents , no not even a fornothing chance , if he knew those articles were written by a junior 
junior nothing 
scoffed katy 
there was not a day of his life that your pa did not spend hours drllin  ye in things the rest of the girls in your school never heard of 
tain t no highschool girl that s written them articles 
it s alexander stong speakin  through the medium of his own flesh and blood 
why , so it is , katy 
cried linda delightedly 
you know , i never thought of that 
i have been so egoistcal i thought i was doing them myself 
paid ye anything yet 
queried katy 
no , said linda , they haven t 
it seems that the amount of interestthe articles evoke is going to decide what i am to be paid for them , but they certainly couldn t take the recipe and the comments and the sketch for less than twentyfive or thirty dollars , unless recipes are like poetry 
peter said the other day that if a poet did not have some other profession to support him , he would strve to death on all he was paid for writing the mostbeautiful things that ever are written in all this world 
peter says even an effort to write a poem is a beautiful thing 
well , maybe that used to be the truth , said katy as she strted toward the door , but i have been reading some things labeled  poetry  in the magazines of late , and if the holy father knows what they mean , he is even bigger than ever i took him to be 
katy , said linda , we are dradful back numbers 
we are letting this world progress and roll right on pastus without a stuggle 
we haven t either one been to a psychoanalystto find out the color of our auras 
now god forbid , said katy 
i ain t going to have one of them things around me 
the colors i am wearin  satisfy me entoirely 
mine are going to satisfy me very shortly , now , laughed linda , because tomorrow is my big day with eileen 
next time we have a minute together , old dear , i will have strted my bank account 
right ye are , said katy , jistexactly right 
you are getting such a great girl it s the proper thing ye should be suitably drssed , and do not ye be too modest the unfortunate thing about that , katy , is that l intimated the other day that i would be content with less than half , since she is older and she should have her chance first now ain t that jistlike ye 
i might have known ye would be doing that very thing 
after i have gone over the accounts , said linda , i will know better what to demand 
now fly to your cooking , katy , and let me sit down at this table and see if i can dig out a few dollars of honestcoin 
i am going to have hard work to keep my eves on the paper with that fireplace before me 
isn t that red and blue lettering the prettiestthing , katy , and do you notice that tiny  p 
m 
cut down in the lower lefthand corner nearly out of sight 
that , katy , stnds for  peter morrison ,  and one of these days peter is going to be a large figure on the landscape 
the next posthe has an article in i will buy for you 
it never does , said katy , to be makin  up your mind in this world so hard and fastthat ye can t change it 
in the days before john gilman got bewitched out of his senses i did think , barrin  your father , that he was the finestman the lord ever made 
i ain t thought so much of him of late as i did before 
same holds good for me , said linda 
i have stdied this peter , continued katy , like your pa used to stdy things under his microscope 
he is the mostcomeatable man 
he is got such a kind of a questonin  look on his face , and there s a bit of a stop to his shoulders like they had been whittled out for carryin  a load , and there s a kind of a whimsy quiverin  around his lips that makes me heart stnd stll every time he speaks to me , because i can t be certain whether he is going to make me laugh or going to make me cry , and when what he is sayin  does come with that little slow drwl , i can t be justsure whether he is meanin  it or whether he is jistpokin  fun at me 
he said the quarestthing to me the other day when he was here fiddlin  over the makin  of this fireplace 
he was stndin  out beside your desert garden and i come aven with him and i says to him    them s the rare plants miss linda and her pa have been goin  to the deserts and the canyons , as long as he lived , to fetch in 
then miss linda went alone , and now the son of judge whiting , the biggestlawyer in los angeles , has begun goin  with her 
ain t it the brightest prettiestplace 
i says to him 
he stod there lookin  , and he says to me    no , katy , that is a graveyard 
now what in the name of raison was the man meanin  by that 
linda stred at the hearth motto reflectively 
a graveyard 
she repeated 
well , if anything could come farther from a graveyard than that spot , i do not know how it would do it 
i haven t the remotestnotion what he meant 
why did not you ask him 
well , the truth is , said katy , that i proide myself on being able to kape me mouth shut when i should 
i will leave to think over it , said linda 
at present i have no more idea than you in what respect my desert garden could resemble a graveyard 
oh 
yes , there s one thing i wanted to ask you , katy 
has eileen been around while this room was being altered 
she came in yestrday , answered katy , when the hammerin  and sawin  was goin  full blast what i wanted to find out  said linda , was whether she had been here and seen this room or not , because if she hasn t and she wants to see it , now is her time 
after i get things going here and these walls are covered with dring sketches this room is going to be stictly private 
you see that you keep your key where nobody gets hold of it 
it s on a sting round me neck this blessed minute , said katy 
i did not see her come up here , but ye could be safe in bettin  anything ye have got that she came 
yes , i imagine she did , said linda 
she would be sufficiently curious that she would come to learn how much i have spent if she had no other interestin me 
she looked at the fireplace reflectively 
i wonder , she said , what eileen thought of that and i wonder if she noticed that little  p 
m 
tucked away down there in the corner 
sure she did , said katy 
she has got eyes like a cat 
she can see more things in a shorter time than anybody i ever knew 
that evening at dinner linda told eileen that the improvements she had made for her convenience in the billiard room were finished , and asked her if she would like to see them 
i can t imagine what you want to stck yourself off up there alone for , said eileen 
i do not believe i am sufficiently interestd in garret skylights and windows to climb up to look at them 
what everybody in the neighborhood can see is that you have absolutely ruined the looks of the back part of the house 
good gracious 
have i 
you know i never thought of that 
of course 
all you have got to do is go on the castlawn and take a look at that side and the back end of the house to see what you have done , said eileen 
undoubtedly you have cut the selling price of the house one thousand , at least  but it s exactly like you not to have thought of what chopping up the roof and the end of the house as you have done , would make it look like 
you have got one of those singletrack minds , linda , that can think of only one thing at a time , and you never do think , when you strt anything , of what the end is going to be 
very likely there s a large amount of truth in that , said linda soberly 
perhaps i do get an idea and pursue it to the exclusion of everything else 
it s an inheritance from daddy , this concentrating with all my might on one thing at a time 
i am very sorry if i have disfigured the house 
what i want to know , said eileen , is how in this world , at present wages and costof material , you are expecting to pay men for the work you have had done 
i can talk more understndingly about that , said linda quietly , day after tomorrow 
i will get home from school tomorrow as early as i can , and then we will figure out our financial situation exactly 
eileen made no reply 
chapter xvi 
producing the evidence when linda hurried home the next evening , her firstword to katy was to ask if eileen were there 
no , she isn t here , said katy , and she is not going to be 
not going to be 
cried linda , her face paling perceptibly 
she went downtown this morning and she telephoned me about three sayin  she had an invoitation to go with a motor party to pasadena this afternoon , an  she wasn t knowin  whether she could get home the night or not 
i do not like it , said linda 
i do not like it at all 
she liked it stll less when eileen came home for a change of clothing the following day , and again went to spend the night with a friend , without leaving any word whatever 
i do not understnd this , said linda , white lipped and tense 
she does not want to see me 
she does not intend to talk business with me if she can possibly help it 
she is treating me as if i were a fouryearold instad of a woman with as much brain as she has 
if she appears while i am gone tomorrow and strts away again , you tell her come to think of it , you needn t tell her anything 
i will give you a note for her 
linda sat down and wrote  dear eileen  it won t be necessary to remind you of our agreement night before lastto settle on an allowance from father s estte for me 
of course i realize that you are purposely avoiding seeing me , for what reason i can t imagine 
i give you warning , that if you have been in this house and have read this note , and are not here with your figures ready to meet me when i get home tomorrow night , i will take matters into my own hands , and do exactly what i think bestwithout the slightestreference to what you think about it 
if you do not want something done that you will dislike , even more than you dislike seeing me , you had better heed this warning 
linda 
she read it over slowly   my , that sounds melodrmatic 
she commented 
it s even got a threat in it , and it s a funny thing to threaten my own sistr 
i do not think that it s a situation that occurs very frequently , but for that matter i sincerely hope that eileen isn t the kind of sistr that occurs frequently 
linda went up to her room and tried to settle herself to work , but found that it was impossible to fix her attention on what she was doing 
her mind jumped from one thing to another in a way that totally prohibited effective work of any kind 
a sudden resolve came into her heart 
she would not wait any longer 
she would know for herself justhow she was situated financially 
she wrote a note to the editor of everybody s home , asking him if it would be convenient to let her know what reception her work was having with his subscribers , whether he desired her to continue the department in his magazines , and if so , what was the bestoffer he could make her for the recipes , the natural histry comments accompanying them , and the sketches 
she went down to the telephone book and looked up the location of the consolidated bank 
she decided that she would stp there on her way from school the next day and ask to be shown the stong accounts 
while she was meditating these heroic measures the bell rang and katy admitted john gilman 
stangely enough , he was asking for linda , not for eileen 
at the firstglimpse of him linda knew that something was wrong 
without any prelude she said abruptly   what s the matter , john 
do not you know where i eileen is either 
approximately , he answered 
she has  phoned me two or three times , but i haven t seen her for three days 
do you know where she is or exactly why she is keeping away from home as she is 
yes , said linda , i do 
i told you the other day the time had come when i was going to demand a settlement of father s estte and a fixed income 
that time came three days ago and i have not seen eileen since 
they entered the living room 
as linda passed the table , propped againsta candlestck on it , she noticed a note addrssed to herself 
oh , here will be an explanation , she said 
here is a note for me 
sit down a minute till i read it 
she seated herself on the arm of a chair , tore open the note , and instntly began reading aloud 
dear little sistr pathetic , interpolated linda , in consideration of the fact that i am about twice as big as she is 
however , we will let that go , and focus on the enclosure 
she waved a slender slip of paper at gilman 
i never was possessed of an article like this before in all my tender young life , but it seems to me that it s a cheque , and i can t tell you quite how deeply it amuses me 
to return to business , at the present instnt i am  dear little sistr  it seems that all the friends i have are particularly insistnt on seeing me all at once and all in a rush 
i do not think i ever had quite so many invitations at one time in my life before , and the next two or three days seem to be going to be equally as full 
i took time to run into the bank and go over things carefully 
i find that after the payment of taxes and insurance and all the household expenses , that by wearing old clothes i have and making them over i can afford to turn over at leastseventyfive dollars a month to you for your clothing and personal expenses 
as i do not know exactly when i can get home , i am enclosing a cheque which is considerably larger than i had supposed i could make it , and i can only do this by skimping myself 
of course you are getting such a big girl and beginning to attract attention , so it is only right that you should have the very bestthat i can afford to do for you 
i am not taking the bill from the mode into consideration 
i paid that with lastmonth s expenses 
with love , eileen 
linda held the letter in one hand , the cheque in the other , and stred questoningly at john gilman 
what do you think of that 
she inquired tersely 
it seems to me , said gilman , that a more pertinent queston would be , what do you think of it 
rot 
if i were a stnographer in your office i would think that i was making a fairly good strt 
i happen to be the daughter of alexander stong living in my own home with my only sistr , who can afford to flit like the flittingestof social butterflies from one party to another as well drssed as , and better drssed than , the great general average 
you have known us , john , ever since eileen sat in the sun to dr her handmade curls , while i was leaving a piece of my drss on every busk in multiflores canyon 
right here and now i am going to show you something 
linda strted upstirs , so john gilman followed her 
she went to the door of eileen s suite and opened it 
now then , she said , take a look at what eileen feels she can afford for herself 
you will observe she has complete and exquisite furnishings and all sorts of feminine accessories on her drssing table 
you will observe that she has fine rugs in her drssing room and bathroom 
let me call your attention to the fact that all these drwers are filled with expensive comforts and conveniences 
angrily linda began to open drwers filled with fancy feminine apparel , daintily and neatly folded , everything in perfect order   gloves , hose , handkerchiefs , ribbons , laces , all in separate compartments she pointed to the high chiffonier , the top decorated with candlestcks and silverframed pictures 
here the drwers revealed heaps of embroidered underclothing and silken garments 
she walked to the closet and threw the door wide 
she pushed hangers on their rods , sliding before the perplexed and bewildered man drss after drss of lace and georgette , walking suits of cloth , steet drsses of silk , and pretty afternoon gowns , heavy coats , light coats , a beautiful evening coat 
linda took this down and held it in front of john gilman 
i see things marked in stre windows , she said 
eileen paid not a penny less than three hundrd for this one coat 
look at the rows of shoes , and pumps , and slippers , and what that box is or i do not know 
linda slid to the light a box screened by the hanging drsses , and with the toe of her shoe lifted the lid , disclosing a complete smoking outfitcase after case of cigarettes 
linda drpped the lid and shoved the box back 
she stod silent a second , then she looked at john gilman 
that is the way things go in this world , she said quietly 
whenever you lose your temper , you always do something you did not intend to do when you strted 
i did not know that , and i wouldn t have shown it to you purposely if i had known it 
it doesn t alter the fact that you should know it 
if you did know it no harm s done but if you did not know it , you shouldn t be allowed to marry eileen without knowing as much about her as you did about marian , and there was nothing about marian that you did not know 
i am sorry for that , but since i have strted this i am going through with it 
now give me justone minute more 
she went down the hall , threw open the door to her room , and walking in said   you have seen eileen s surroundings 
now take a look at mine 
there s my bed 
there s my drsser and toilet articles 
this is my wardrbe 
she opened the closet door and exhibited a pair of overalls in which she watered her desert garden 
next ranged her khaki breeches and felt hat 
hung the old serge school drss , beside it the extra skirt and orange blouse 
the stck of underclothing on the shelves was pitifully small , visibly dilapidated 
two or three outgrown gingham drsses hung forlornly on the opposite wall 
linda stod tall and staight before john gilman 
what i have on and one other waistconsttute my wardrbe , she said , and i told eileen where to get this drss and suggestd it before i got it 
gilman looked at her in a dazed fashion 
i do not understnd , he said slowly 
if that isn t the drss i saw eileen send up for herself , i am badly mistken 
it was the saturday we went to riverside 
it surely is the very drss 
linda laughed bleakly 
that may be , she said 
the one time she ever has any respect for me is in a queston of tast 
she will agree that i know when colors are right and a thing is artistc 
now then , john , you are the administator of my father s estte 
you have seen what you have seen 
what are you going to do about it 
linda , he said quietly , what my heart might prompt me to do in consideration of the fact that i am engaged to marry eileen , and what my legal sense tells me i mustdo as executor of your father s wishes , are different propositions 
i am going to do exactly what you tell me to 
what you have shown me , and what i would have realized , if i had stpped to think , is neither right nor just then linda took her tun at deep thought 
john , she said at last i am feeling depressed over what i have justdone 
i am not sure that in losing my temper and bringing you up here i have played the game fairly 
you do not need to do anything 
i will manage my affairs with eileen myself 
i will tell you before you go , that you needn t practice any subterfuges 
when she reaches the point where she is ready to come home , i will tell her that you were here , and what you have seen 
that is the besti can do toward squaring myself with my own conscience 
slowly they walked down the ha]l together 
at the head of the stirs linda took the cheque that she carried and tore it into bits 
stpping across the hall , she let the little heap slowly flutter to the rug in front of eileen s door 
she went back to her room and left john gilman to his own reflections 
chapter xvii 
a rock and a flame the firsttime linda entered the kitchen after her interview with gilman , katy asked in deep concern , now what ye been doing , lambie 
doing the baby act , katy , confessed linda 
disgracing myself 
losing my temper 
i wish i could bring myself to the place where i would think half a dozen times before i do a thing once 
now look here , said katy , beginning to briste , ain t it the truth that ye have thought for four years before ye did this thing once 
quite so , said linda 
since i am the daughter of the finestgentleman i ever knew , i should not do hast , regrettable things 
on the livingroom table i found a note sweeter than honey , and it contained a cheque for me that wouldn t pay eileen s bills for lunches , candy , and theaters for a month 
in undue heat i reduced it to bits and decorated the rug before her door 
before that , katy , i led my guardian into the room , and showed him everything 
i meant to tell him that , since he had neglected me for four years , he could see that i had justce now , but when i would personally conducted him from eileen s room to mine , and when i took a good look at him there was something on his face , katy , that i couldn t endure 
i told him to leave it to me 
that i would tell eileen myself what i had done , and so i will 
i am sorry i did it , katy 
i am awfully sorry 
you always told me to keep my temper and i lostit completely 
from now on i certainly will try to behave myself more like a woman than a spoiled child 
now give me a dustcloth and brushes 
i am almostthrough with my job in the library and i want to finish , because i shall be forced to use the money from the books to pay for my skylight and fireplace 
linda went to the library and began work , efficiently , carefully , yet with a precise rapidity habitual to her 
down the long line of heavy technical books , she came to the end of the shelf 
three books from the end she noticed a difference in the wall behind the shelf 
hastly removing the other two volumes , she disclosed a small locked door having a scrap of paper protruding from the edge which she pulled out and upon which she read  in the event of my passing , should anyone move these books and find this door , these lines are to inform him that it is to remain untouched 
the key to it is in my safetydeposit vault at the consolidated bank 
the bank will open the door and attend to the contents of the box at the proper time 
linda fixed the paper back exactly as she had found it 
she stod looking at the door a long time , then she carefully wiped it , the wall around it , and the shelf 
going to another shelf , she picked out the books that had been written by her father and , beginning at the end of the shelf , she ranged them in a row until they completely covered the opening 
she finished filling the shelf with other books that she meant to keep , but her brain was working , milling over and over the queston of what that little compartment contained and when it was to be opened and whether john gilman knew about it , and whether the consolidated bank would remember the day specified , and whether it would mean anything important to her 
she carried the dustrs back to katy , and going to her room , concentrated resolutely upon her work 
she was unable to do anything constuctive 
her routine lessons she could prepare , but she could not even sketch a wild rose accurately 
finally she  laid down her pencil , washed her brushes , put away her material , and locking her door , slipped the key into her pocket 
going down to the garage she climbed into the bear cat and headed staight for peter morrison 
she drve into his location and blew the horn 
peter stpped from the garage , and seeing her , strted in her direction 
linda sprang down and hurried toward him 
he looked at her intently as she approached and formed his own conclusions 
rt of restess , said linda 
couldn t evolve a single new idea with which to enliven the gay annals of english literature and greek histry 
a personal histry seems infinitely more insistnt and unusual 
i ran away from my lessons , and my work , and came to you , peter , because i had a feeling that there was something you could give me , and i thought you would 
peter smiled a slow curious smile 
i like your line of thought , linda , he said quietly 
it greatly appeals to me 
any time an ancient and patriarchal literary man named peter morrison can serve as a rock upon which a young thing can rest why he will be glad to be that rock 
what were you doing 
asked linda abruptly 
come and see , said peter 
he led the way to the garage 
his worktable and the cement floor around it were littered with sheets of closely typed paper 
i will have to assemble them first said peter , getting down on his knees and beginning to pick them up 
linda sat on a packing case and watched him 
already she felt comforted 
of course peter was a rock , of course anyone could trusthim , and of course if the tempestof life beat upon her too stongly she could always fly to peter 
may i 
she inquired , stetching her hand in the direction of a sheet 
sure , said peter 
what is it 
inquired linda lightly 
the bridge or the road or the playroom 
gad 
he said slowly 
do not talk about me being a rock 
rocks are stlid , stdgy unresponsive things 
i thought i was stuggling with one of the biggestpolitical problems of the day from an economic and psychological stndpoint 
if i would had sense enough to realize that it was a bridge i was building , i might have done the thing with some imagination and subtlety 
if you want a rock and you say i am a rock , a rock i will be , linda 
i know what you are , and what you will be to me when we really become the kind of friends we are destned to be 
i wonder now , said linda , if you are going to say that i could be any such lovely thing on the landscape as a bridge 
no , said peter slowly , nothing so prosaic 
bridges are common in this world 
you are going to be something uncommon 
histry records the experiences of but one man who has seen a flame in the open 
i am a second moses and you are going to be my burning bush 
i intended to read this article to you 
peter massed the sheets , staightened them on the desk , and deliberately ripped them across several times 
linda sprang to her feet and stetched out her hands 
why , peter 
she cried in a shocked voice 
that is perfectly inexcusable 
there are hours and hours of work on that , and i have not a doubt but that it was good work 
simple case of mechanism , said peter , reducing the bits to smaller size and drpping them into the empty nail keg that served as his wastbasket 
a lifeless thing without a soul , mere clockwork 
i have got the idea now 
i am to build a bridge and make a road 
every way i look i can see a goldenflame tongue of inspiration burning 
i will rewrite that thing and animate it 
take me for a ride , linda 
linda rose and walked to the bear cat 
peter climbed in and sat beside her 
linda laid her hands on the stering wheel and strted the car 
she ran it down to the highway and chose a level road leading staight down the valley through cultivated country 
in all the world there was nothing to equal the panorama that she spread before peter that evening 
she drve the bear cat pastorchards , hundrds of acres of orchards of waxen green leaves and waxen white bloom of orange , grapefruit , and lemon 
she took him where seas of pink outlined peach orchards , and  other seas the more delicate tint of the apricots 
she glided down avenues lined with palm and eucalyptus , pepper and olive , and through unbroken rows , extending for miles , of roses , long stetches of white , again a stetch of pink , then salmon , yellow , and red 
nowhere in all the world are there to be found so many acres of orchard bloom and so many miles of treelined , rosedecorated roadway as in southern california 
she sent the little car through the evening until she felt that it was time to go home , and when at lastshe stpped where they had strted , she realized that neither she nor peter had spoken one word 
as he stpped from the car she leaned toward him and reached out her hand 
thank you for the fireplace , peter , she said 
peter took the hand she extended and held it one minute in both his own 
very gently he staightened it out in the palm of one of his hands and with the other hand turned back the fingers and laid his lips to the heart of it 
thank you , linda , for the flame , he said , and turning abruptly , he went toward his workroom 
stpping for a bite to eat in the kitchen , linda went back to her room 
she sat down at the table and picking up her pencil , began to work , and found that she could work 
every stoke came true and stong 
every idea seemed original and unusual 
quite as late as a light ever had shone in her window , it shone that night , the lastthing she did being to write another anonymous letter to marian , and when she reread it linda realized that it was an appealing letter 
she thought it certainly would comfort marian and surely would make her feel that someone worth while was interestd in her and in her work 
she loved some of the whimsical little touches she had put into it , and she wondered if she had made it so much like peter morrison that it would be suggestve of him to marian 
she knew that she had no right to do that and had no such intention 
she merely wanted a model to copy from and peter seemed the mostappealing model at hand 
after school the next day linda reported that she had finished going through the books and was ready to have them taken 
after a few minutes of deep thought , she made her way to the consolidated bank 
at the window of the paying teller she explained that she wished to see the person connected with the bank who had charge of the safetydeposit boxes and who looked after the accounts pertaining to the estte of alexander stong 
the teller recognized the name 
he immediately became deferential 
i will take you to the office of the president , he said 
he and doctor stong were very warm friends 
you can explain to him what it is you want to know 
before she realized what was happening , linda found herself in an office that was all m ogany and marble 
at a huge desk stcked with papers sat a man , considerably older than her father 
linda remembered to have seen him frequently in their home , in her father s car , and she recalled one fishing expedition to the tulare lake region where he had been a member of her father s party 
of course you have forgotten me , mr worthington , she said as she approached his desk 
i have grown such a tall person during the pastfour years 
the whitehaired financier rose and stetched out his hand 
you exact replica of alexander stong , he said laughingly , i couldn t forget you any more than i could forget your father 
that fine fishing trip where you proved such a grand little scout is bright in my memory as one of my happiestvacations 
sit down and tell me what i can do for you 
linda sat down and told him that she was dissatisfied with the manner in which her father s estte was being administred 
he listned very carefully to all she had to say , then he pressed a button and gave a few words of instuction to the clerk who answered it 
when several ledgers and account books were laid before him , with practiced hand he turned to what he wanted 
the records were not complicated 
they covered a period of four years 
they showed exactly what monies had been paid into the bank for the estte 
they showed what royalties had been paid on the books 
linda sat beside him and watched his pencil running up and down columns , setting down a listof items , and making everything plain 
paid cheques for household expenses i and drgoods bills were all recorded and deducted 
with narrow , alert eyes , linda was watching , and her brain was keenly alive 
as she realized the discrepancy between the annual revenue from the estte and the totaling of the expenses , she had an inspiration 
mething she never before had thought of occurred to her 
she looked the banker in the eye and said very quietly   and now , since she is my sistr and i am going to be of age very shortly and these things mustall be gone into and opened up , would it be out of place for me to ask you this afternoon to let me have a glimpse at the private account of miss eileen stong 
the banker drw a deep breath and looked at linda keenly 
that would not be custmary , he said slowly 
no 
since father and mother went out at the same time and there was no will and the property would be legally divided equally between us upon my coming of age , would my sistr be entitled to a private account 
had she any sources of obtaining money outside the estte 
no , said linda 
at leastnone that i know of 
mother had i some relatives in san francisco who were very wealthy people , but they never came to see us and we never went there 
i know nothing about them 
i never had any money from them and i am quite sure eileen never had 
linda sat very quietly a minute and then she looked at the banker 
mr worthington , she said , the situation is slightly peculiar 
my guardian , john gilman , is engaged to marry my sistr eileen 
she is a beautiful girl , as you no doubt recall , and he is very much in love with her 
undoubtedly she has been able , at leastrecently , to manage affairs very much in her own way 
she is more than four years my senior , and has always had charge of the household accounts and the handling of the bank accounts 
since there is such a wide discrepancy between the returns from the property and the expenses that these books show , i am forced  
o the conclusion that there mustbe upon your books , or the books of some other bank in the city , a private account in eileen s name or in the name of the stong estte 
that i can very easily ascertain , said mr worthington , reaching again toward the button on his desk 
a few minutes later the report came that there was a private account in the name of miss eileen stong 
again linda was deeply thoughtful 
is there anything i can do , she inquired , to prevent that account from being changed or drwn out previous to my coming of age 
mr worthington grew thoughtful 
yes , he said at last  if you are dissatisfied , if you feel that you have reason to believe that money rightfully belonging to you is being diverted to other channels , you have the right to issue an injunction againstthe bank , ordering it not to pay out any further money on any account nor to honor any cheques drwn by miss stong until the settlement of the estte 
ask your guardian to execute and deliver such an injunction , or merely ask him , as your guardian and the administator of the estte , to give the bank a written order to that effect 
because he is engaged to eileen , i told him i would not bring him into this matter , said linda 
i told him that i would do what i wanted done , myself 
well , how long is it until this coming birthday of yours 
inquired mr worthington 
less than two weeks , answered linda 
for a time the financier sat in deep thought , then he looked at linda 
it was a keen , searching look 
it went to the depths of her eyes 
it included her face and hair 
it included the folds of her drss , the cut of her shoe , and restd attentively on the slender hands lying quietly in her lap 
i see the circumstnces very clearly , he said 
i sympathize with your position 
having known your father and being well acquainted with your guardian , would you be satisfied if i should take the responsibility of issuing to the clerks an order not to allow anything to be drwn from the private account until the settlement of the estte 
perfectly satisfied , said linda 
it might be , said mr worthington , managing matters i that way , that no one outside of ourselves need ever know of il should your sistr not drw on the private account in the mean time , she would be free to drw household cheques on the monthly income and if in the settlement of the estte she turns in this private account or accounts , she need never know of the restiction concerning this fund 
thank you very much , said linda 
that will fix everything finely 
on her way to the steet car , linda s brain whirled 
it s not conceivable , she said , that eileen should be enriching herself at my expense 
i can t imagine her being dishonestin money affairs , and yet i can recall scarcely a circumstnce in life in which eileen has ever hesitated to be dishonestwhen a lie served her purpose better than the truth 
anyway , matters are safe now 
the next day the books were taken and a cheque for their value was waiting for linda when she reached home 
she cashed this cheque and went staight to peter morrison for his estmate of the expenses for the skylight and fireplace 
when she asked for the bill peter hesitated 
you wouldn t accept this little addition to your stdy as a gift from henry and me 
he asked lightly 
it would be a great pleasure to us if you would 
i could accept stnes that henry anderson had gathered from the mountains and canyons , and i could accept a verse carved on stne , and be delighted with the gift 
i couldn t accept hours of day labor at the present price of labor , so you will have to give me the bill , peter 
peter did not have the bill , but he had memoranda , and when linda paid him she reflected that the current talk concerning the inflated price of labor was greatly exaggerated 
for two evenings as linda returned from school and went to her room she glanced down the hall and smiled at the decoration remaining on eileen s rug 
the third evening it was gone , so that she knew eileen was either in her room or had been there 
she did not meet her sistr until dinnertime 
she was prepared to watch eileen , to stdy her closely 
she was not prepared to admire her , but in her heart she almostdid that very thing 
eileen had practiced subterfuges so long , she was so accomplished , that it would have taken an expert to distnguish reality from subterfuge 
she entered the dining room humming a gay tune 
she was carefully drssed and appealingly beautiful 
she blew a kiss to linda and waved gaily to katy 
i was rather afraid , she said lightly , that i might find you two in mourning when i got back 
i never styed so long before , did i 
seemed as if every friend i had made special demand on my time all at once 
hope you haven t been dull without me 
oh , no , said linda quietly 
being away at school all day , of course i wouldn t know whether you were at home or not , and i have grown so accustmed to spending my evenings alone that i do not rely on you for entertainment at any time 
in other words , said eileen , it doesn t make any difference to you where i am 
not so far as enjoying your company is concerned , said linda 
otherwise , of course it makes a difference 
i hope you had a happy time 
oh , i always have a happy time , answered eileen lightly 
i certainly have the bestfriends 
that s your good fortune , answered linda 
at the close of the meal linda sat waiting 
eileen gave katy instuctions to have things ready for a midnight lunch for her and john gilman and then , humming her tune again , she left the dining room and went upstirs 
linda stod looking after her 
now or never , she said at last  i have no business to let her meet john until i have recovered my selfrespect 
the lord help me to do the thing decently  
she followed eileen up the stirway 
she tapped at the door , and without waiting to hear whether she was invited or not , opened it and stpped inside 
eileen was sitting before the window , a big box of candy beside her , a magazine in her fingers 
evidently she intended to keep her temper in case the coming interview threatened to become painful 
i was half expecting you , she said , you silly hothead 
i found the cheque i wrote you when i got home this afternoon 
that was a foolish thing to do 
why did you tear it up 
if it were too large or if it were not enough why did not you use it and ask for another 
because i had to be away that was merely to leave you something to go on until i got back 
linda did the mostdisconcerting thing possible 
in her effort at selfcontrol she went too far 
she merely folded her hands in her lap and sat looking staight at eileen without saying one word 
it did not show much on the surface , but eileen really had a conscience , she really had a soul 
linda s eyes , restng rather speculatively on her , were honesteyes , and eileen knew what she knew 
she flushed and fidgeted , and at lastshe broke out impatiently   oh , for goodness  sake , linda , do not play  patienceonamonument 
speak up and say what it is that you want 
if that cheque was not big enough , what will satisfy you 
come to think of it , said linda quietly , i can get along with what i have for the short time until the legal settlement of our interest is due 
you needn t bother any more about a cheque 
eileen was surprised and her face showed it 
she was also relieved 
that too her face showed 
i always knew , she said lightly , that i had a little sistr with a remarkably level head and good common sense 
i am glad that you recognize the awful inflation of prices during the war period , and how i have had to skimp and scheme and save in order to make ends meet and to keep us going on papa s meager income 
all linda s good resolutions vanished 
she was under stong nervous tension 
it irritated her to have eileen constntly referring to their monetary affairs as if they were practically paupers , as if their father s life had been a financial failure , as if he had not been able to realize from achievements recognized around the world a comfortable living for two women 
oh , good lord 
she said shortly 
bluff the restof the world like a professional , eileen , but why try it with me 
you are right about my having common sense 
i will admit that i am using it now 
i will be of age in a few days , and then we will take john gilman and go to the consolidated bank , and if it suits your convenience to be absent for four or five days at that period , i will take john gilman and we will go together 
eileen was amazed 
the receding color in her cheeks left the rouge on them a ghasty , garish thing 
well , i won t do anything of the sort , she said hotly , and neither will john gilman 
unfortunately for you , answered linda , john gilman is my guardian , not yours 
he will be forced to do what the law says he must and what common decency tells him he must no matter what his personal feelings are 
i might as well tell you that your absence has done you no good 
you would far better have come home , as you agreed to , and gone over the books and made me a decent allowance , because in your absence john came here to ask me where you were , and i know that he was anxious 
he came here 
cried eileen 
why , yes , said linda 
was it anything unusual 
hasn t he been coming here ever since i can remember 
evidently you did not keep him as well postd this time as you usually do 
he came here and asked for me 
i suppose , said eileen , an ugly red beginning to rush into her white cheeks , that you took pains to make things uncomfortable for me 
i am very much afraid , said linda , that you are right 
you have made things uncomfortable for me ever since i can remember , for i can t remember the time when you were not finding fault with me , putting me in the wrong and getting me criticized and punished if you possibly could 
it was a fair understnding that you should be here , and you were not , and i was seeing red about it 
justas john came in i found your note in tile living room and read it aloud 

oh , well , there was nothing in that , said eileen in a relieved tone 
nothing in the wording of it , no , said linda , but there was everything in the intention back of it 
because you did not live up to your tacit agreement , and because i had been on high tension for two or three days , i lostmy temper completely 
i brought john gilman up here and showed him the suite of rooms in which you have done for yourself , for four years 
i gave him rather a thorough inventory of your drssing table and drwers , and then i opened the closet door and called his attention to the number and the quality of the garments hanging there 
the box underneath them i thought was a shoe box , but it did not prove to be exactly that 
for that i want to tell you , as i have already told john , i am sorry 
i wouldn t have done that if i had known what i was doing 
is that all 
inquired eileen , making a desperate effort at selfcontrol 
not quite , said linda 
when i finished with your room , i took him back and showed him mine in even greater detail than i showed him yours 
i thought the contrastwould be more enlightening than anything either one of us could say 
i suppose you realize , said eileen bitterly , that you lostme john gilman when you did it 
i 
i lostyou john gilman when i did it 
i did not do it 
you did it 
you have been busy for four years doing it 
if you hadn t done it , it wouldn t have been there for me to show him 
i can t see that this is profitable 
certainly it s the mostdistessing thing that ever has occurred for me 
i did not feel that i could let you meet john gilman tonight without telling you what he knows 
if you have any way to square your conscience and cleanse your soul before you meet him , you had better do it , for he is a mighty fine man and if you lose him you will have lostthe bestchance that is likely ever to come to you 
linda sat stdying eileen 
she saw the gallant effort she was making to keep her selfpossession , to think with her accustmed rapidity , to stike upon some scheme whereby she could square herself 
she rose and strted toward the door 
what you will say to john i haven t the faintestnotion , she said 
i told him very little 
i justshowed him 
she went out and closed the door after her 
at the foot of the stirs she met katy admitting gilman 
without any preliminaries she said   i repeat , john , that i am sorry for what happened the other day 
i have justcome from eileen 
she will be down as soon as katy tells her you are here , no doubt 
i have done what i told you i would 
she knows what i showed you so you needn t employ any subterfuges 
you can be frank and honestwith each other 
i wish to god we could , said john gilman 
linda went to her work 
she decided that she would gauge what happened by the length of time john styed 
if he remained only a few minutes it would indicate that there had been a rupture 
if he styed as long as he usually did , the chances were that eileen s wit had triumphed as usual 
at twelve o clock linda laid her pencils in the box , washed the brushes , and went down the back stirs to the ice chestfor a glass of milk 
the living room was stll lighted and linda thought eileen s laugh quite as gay as she ever had heard it 
linda closed her lips very tight and slowly climbed the stirs 
when she entered her room she walked up to the mirror and stred at herself in the glass for a long time , and then of herself she asked this queston  well , how do you suppose she did it 
chapter xviii 
spanish iris justas linda was mostdeeply absorbed with her own concerns there came a letter from marian which linda read and reread several times 
for marian wrote  my dearestpal  life is so busy up san francisco way that it makes lilac valley look in retrospection like a peaceful sunset preliminary to bed time 
i want you to have the consolation and the comfort of knowing that i have found at leasttwo friends that i hope will endure 
one is a woman who has a room across the hall from mine in my apartment house 
she is a newspaper woman and life is very full for her , but it is filled with such intensely interestng things that i almostregret having made my life work anything so prosaic as inanimate houses 
then it s my dram to enliven each house i plan with at leastthe spirit of home 
this womanher name is dana meadeenlivens every hour of her working day with something concerning the welfare of humanity 
she is a beautiful woman in her soul , so extremely beautiful that i can t at this minute write you a detailed description of her hair and her eyes and her complexion , because this nice , big , friendly light that radiates from her so lights her up and transfigures her that everyone says how beautiful she is , and yet i have a vague recollection that her nose is what you would call a beak , and i am afraid her cheek bones are too high for good proportion , and i know that her hair is not always so carefully drssed as it should be , but what is the difference when the hair is crowned with a halo 
i can t swear to any of these things 
they are sketchy impressions 
the only thing i am absolutely sure about is the inner light that shines to an unbelievable degree 
i wish she had more time and i wish i had more time and that she and i might become such friends as you and i are 
i can t tell you , dear , how much i think of you 
it seems to me that you are running a sort of undercurrent in my thoughts all day long 
you will hardly credit it , linda , but a few days ago i drve a car through the thickesttraffic , up a step hill , and round a curve 
i did it , but practically collapsed when it was over 
the why of it was this   i think i told you before that in the offices of nicholson and snow there is a man who is an understnding person 
he is the junior partner and his name is eugene snow 
i happened to arrive at his desk the day i came for my instuctions and to make my plans for entering their contest  he was very kind to me and went out of his way to smooth out the rough places 
ever since , he makes a point of coming to me and talking a few minutes when i am at the office or when he passes me on my way to the drfting rooms where i take my lessons 
the day i mention i had worked late and hard the night before 
i had done the lastpossible thing to the plans for my dram house 
at the lastminute , getting it all on paper , working at the specifications , at which you know i am wobbly , was nervous business 
when i came from the desk after having turned in my plans , perhaps i showed fatigue 
anyway , he said to me that his car was below 
he said also that he was a lonely person , having losthis wife two years ago , and not being able very frequently to see his little daughter who is in the care of her grandmother , there were times when he was hungry for the companionship he had lost  he asked me if i would go with him for a drve and i told him that i would 
i am rather stnned yet over what happened 
the runabout he led me to was greatly like yours , and , linda , he stpped at a florists and came out with an armload of bloomexquisite lavender and pale pink and faint yellow and waxen whitethe mostenticing armload of spring 
for one minute i truly experienced a thrill 
i thought he was going to give that mass of flowers to me , but he did not 
he merely laid it across my lap and said   edith adored the flowers from bulbs 
i never see such bloom that my heart does not ache with a keen , angry ache to think that she should be taken from the world , and the beauty that she so loved , so early and so ruthlessly 
we will take her these as i would take them to her were she living 
linda dear , i sat there and looked at color and drnk in fragrance , and we whirled through the city and away to a cemetery on a beautiful hill , and filled a vase inside the gates of a mausoleum with these appealing flowers 
we sat down , and a man with a hurt heart told me about his hurt , and what an effort he was making to get through the world as the woman he loved would have had him 
before i knew what i was doing , linda , i told him the tellable part of my own hurts 
i even lifted my turban and bowed my white head before him 
this hurtit was one of the inexorable things that come to people in this worldi could talk about 
that deeper hurt , which has put a scar that never will be effaced on my soul , of course i could not tell him about 
when we went back to the car he said to me that he would help me to get back into the sunlight 
he said the firstthing i mustdo to regain selfconfidence was to begin drving again 
i told him i could not , but he said i must and made me take the drver s seat of a car i had never seen and take the stering wheel of a make of machine i had never drven , and tackle two or three serious problems for a drver 
i did it all right , linda , because i couldn t allow myself to fail the kind of a man mr snow is , when he was truly trying to help me , but in the depths of my heart i am afraid i am a coward forever , for there is a ghasty illness takes possession of me as i write these details to you 
anyway , put a red mark on your calendar beside the date on which you get this letter , and joyfully say to yourself that marian has found two real , sympathetic friends 
in a week or ten days i shall know about the contest  if 1   win , as i really have a sneaking hope that i shall , since i have condensed the bestof two dozen houses into one and exhaustd my imagination on my dram home , i will surely telegraph , and you can make it a day of jubilee 
if i fail , i will try to find out where my dram was not true and what can be done to make it materialize properly 
between us , linda girl , i am going to be dradfully disappointed 
i could use the material value that prize represents 
i could strt my life work which i hope to do in lilac valley on the prestge and the background that it would give me 
i do not know , linda , whether you ever learned to pray or not , but i have , and it s a thing that helps when the black shadow comes , when you reach the land of benefits forgot and friends remembered not 
this reminds me that i should not write to my very dearestfriend who has her own problems and make her heart sad with mine 
to the joyful news of my two friends add a third , linda , for i am going to tell you a secret because it will make you happy 
since i have been in san francisco some man , who for a reason of his own does not tell me his name , has been writing me extremely attractive letters 
i have had several of them and i can t tell you , linda , what they mean to me or how they help me 
there is a touch of whimsy about them 
i can t as yet connect them with anybody i ever met , but to me they are taking the place of a little lunch on the bread of life 
they are such real , such vivid , such alive letters from such a real person that i have been doing the very foolish and romantic thing of answering them as my heart dictates and signing my own name to them , which on the surface looks unwise when the man in the case keeps his identity in the background 
since he knows me and knows my name it seems useless to do anything else   and answer these letters i shall and must because every one of them is to me a stong light thrown on john gilman 
every time one of these letters comes to me i have the feeling that i would like to reach out through space and pick up the man who is writing them and dangle him before eileen and say to her   take him 
i dare you to take him 
my confidence , linda , is positively supreme that she could not do it 
you know , between us , linda , we regarded eileen as a rare creature , a kind of exotic thing , made to be kept in a glass house with tempered air and warmed water 
as i go about the city and at times amuse myself at concerts and theaters , i am rather dazed to tell you , honey , that the world is chock full of eileens 
on the steets , in the stres , everywhere i go , sometimes half a dozen times in a day i say to myself   there goes eileen 
i haven t a doubt that eileen has a heart , if it has not become so calloused that nobody could ever reach it , and i suspect she has a soul , but the more i see of her kind the more i feel that john gilman may have to breastrather black water before he finds them 
with dearestlove , be sure to remember me to katherine on wouldonovan 
hug her tight and give her my unqualified love 
do not let her forget me 
as ever , marian 
this was the letter that linda read once , then she read it again and then she read it a third time , and after that she lostcount and reread it whenever she was not busy doing something else , for it was a letter that was the next thing to laying hands upon marian 
the part of the letter concerning the unknown man who was writing marian , linda pondered over deeply 
that is the bestthing i ever did in my life , she said in self commendation 
it s doing more than i hoped it would 
it s giving marian something to think about 
it s giving her an interestin life 
it s distacting her attention 
without saying a word about john gilman it is making her see for herself the weak spots in him through the very subtle method of calling her attention to the stength that may lie in another man 
for once in your life , linda , you have done something stictly worth while 
the thing for you to do is to keep it up , and in order to keep it up , to make each letter fresh and original , you will have to do a good deal of stcking around peter morrison s location and absorbing rather thoroughly the things he says 
peter doesn t know he is writing those letters but he is in them till it s a wonder marian does not hear him drwl and see the imps twistng his lips as she reads them 
before i write another single one i will go see peter 
maybe he will have that article written 
i will take a pencil , and as he reads i will jot down the salient points and then i will come home and work out a head and tail piece for him to send in with it , and in that way i will ease my soul about the skylight and the fireplace 
linda took pad and pencils , raided katy for everything she could find that was temptingly edible , climbed into the bear cat , and went to see peter as frankly as she would have crossed the lawn to visit marian 
he was not in the garage when she stpped her car before it , but the workmen told her that he had stolled up the mountain and that probably he would return soon 
learning that he had been gone but a short time linda set the bear cat squalling at the top of its voice 
she took possession of the garage , and clearing peter s worktable spread upon it the food she had brought , and then strted out to find some flowers for decorations 
when peter came upon the scene he found linda , flushed and brilliant eyed , holding before him a big bouquet of alder bloom , the lastof the lilacs she had found in a cool , shaded place , pink filaree , blue lupin , and white m ogany panicles 
peter , she cried 
you can t guess what i have been doing 
peter glanced at the flowers 
isn t it obvious 
he inquired 
no , it isn t , said linda , because i am capable of two processes at once 
the work of my hands is visible 
with it i am going to decorate your table 
you won t have to go down to the resturant for your supper tonight because i have brought my supper up to share with you , and after we finish , you are going to read me your article as you have rewritten it 
i am going to decorate it and we are going to make a hit with it that will be at leasta strt on the road to greater fame 
what you see is material 
you can pick it up , smell it , admire it and eat it 
what i have truly been doing is setting spanish iris for yards down one side of the bed of your steam 
when i left it was a foot and a half high peter , and every blue that the sky ever knew in its loveliestmoments , and a yellow that is the concentrated essence of the bestgold from the heart of california 
oh , peter , there is enchantment in the way i set it 
there are irregular deep beds , and there are staggly places where there are only one or two in a ragged steak , and then it runs along the edge in a fringy rim , and then it stetches out in a marshy place that is going to have some other wild things , arrowheads , and orchids , and maybe a bunch of paint brush on a high , dr spot near by 
i wish you could see it 
peter looked at linda reflectively and then he told her that he could see it 
he fold her that he adored it , that he was crazy about her staggly continuity and her fringy border , but there was not one word of truth in what he said , because what he saw was a slender thing , willowy , graceful 
roughened wavy black hair hanging half her length in heavy braids , dark eyes and bright cheeks , a vivid red line of mouth , and a bright brown line of freckles bridging a prominent and aristcratic nose 
what he was seeing was a soul , a young thing , a thing he coveted with every nerve and fiber of his being 
while he glibly humored her in her vision of decorating his brook , in his own consciousness he was saying to himself   is there any reason why i should not try for her 
then he answered himself 
there is no reason in your life 
there is nothing ugly that could offend her or hurt her 
the reason , the real reason , probably lies in the fact that if she were thinking of caring for anyone it would be for that attractive young schoolmate she brought up here for me to exercise my wits upon 
it is very likely that she regards me in the light of a grandfatherly person to whom she can come with her joys or her problems , as frankly as she has now 
peter asked if the irises crossed the brook and ran down both sides 
linda sat on a packing case and concentrated on the iris , and finally she announced that they did 
she informed him that his place was going to bc natural , that nature evolved things in her own way 
she did not grow irises down one side of a brook and arrowheads down the other 
they waded across and flew across and visited back and forth , riding the water or the wind or the down of a bee or the tail of a cow 
as she served the supper she had brought she very gravely informed him that there would be iris on both sides of his brook , and cress and miners  lettuce under the bridge 
she knew exactly where the wild clematis grew that would whiten his embankment after his workmen had extracted the lastroot of poison oak 
it may not scorch you , peter , she said gravely , but you mustlook out for the missus and the little things 
i haven t definitely decided on her yet , but she looks a good deal like mary louise whiting to mc 
i saw her the other day 
she came to school after donald 
i liked her looks so well that i said to myself    everybody talks about how fine she is 
i shouldn t wonder if i had better save her for peter  
if i decide to , you should act that poison stff out , because it s sure as shooting to attack any one with the soft , delicate skin that goes with a golden head 
oh , let s leave it in , said peter , and dispense with the golden head 
by the time you get that steam planted as you are planning , i will have become so accustmed to a dark head bobbing up and down beside it that i won t take kindly to a sorrel top 
that is positively sacrilegious , said linda , lifting her hands to her rough black hair 
never in my life saw anything lovelier than the rich gold on louise whiting s bare head as she bent to release her brakes and strt her car 
a black head looks like a cinder bed beside it 
only think what a sunburstit will be when mary louise kneels down beside the iris 
when they had finished their supper linda gathered up the remnants and put them in the car , then she laid a notebook and pencil on the table 
now i want to hear that article , she said 
i knew you would do it over the minute i was gone , and i knew you would keep it to read to me before you sent it 
hm , said peter 
is it second sight or psychoanalysis or telepathy , or what 
mosty  what  , laughed linda 
i merely knew 
the workmen are gone and everything is quiet now , peter 
begin 
i am crazy to get the particular angle from which you  make the world safe for democracy 
john used to call our attention to your articles during the war 
he said we had not sent another man to france who could write as humanely and as interestngly as you did 
i wish i had kept those articles 
because i did not get anything from them to compare with what i can get since i have a slight acquaintance with the procession that marches around your mouth 
peter , you will have to watch that mouth of yours 
it s an awfully betraying feature 
long as it s occupied with politics and the fads and the foibles and the sins and the foolishness and the extravagances of humanity , it s all very well 
if you ever get in trouble or if ever your heart hurts , or you get mad enough to kill somebody , that mouth of yours is going to be a mostawfully revealing feature , peter 
you will have hard work to settle it down into hardandfastnoncommittal lines 
peter looked at the girl stadily 
have you specialized on my mouth 
he asked 
huhumph 
when i specialize i use a pin and a microscope and go right to the root of matters as i was taught 
this is superficial 
i am extemporizing now 
well , if this is extemporizing , said peter , god help my soul if you ever go at me with a pin and a microscope 
oh , but i won t 
cried linda 
it wouldn t be kind to pin your friends on a setting board and use a microscope on them 
you might see things that were stictly private 
you might see things they wouldn t want you to see 
they might not be your friends any more if you did that 
when i make a friend i justtake him on trustlike i did donald 
you are my friend , aren t you , peter 
yes , linda , said peter soberly 
put me to any testyou can think of if you want proof 
i do not believe in proving friends , either , said linda 
i believe in nurturing them 
i would set a friend in my garden and water his feet and turn the sunshine on him and tell him to sty there and grow 
i might fertilize him , i might prune him , and i might use insecticide on him 
i might spray him with rather stingent solutions , but i give you my word i would not testhim 
if he flourished under my care i would know it , and if he did not i would know it , and that would be all i would want to know 
i have watched daddy search for the seat of nervous disorders , and sometimes he had to probe very deep to find what developed nerves unduly but he did not ever do any picking and raveling and fringing at the soul of a human being merely for the sake of finding out what it was made of 
everyone says i am like him 
i wish i might have known him , said peter 
do not i wish it 
now then , peter , go  ead 
read your article 
peter opened a packing case , picked out a sheaf of papers , and sitting opposite linda , began to read 
he was dumbfounded to find that he , a man who had read and talked extemporaneously before great bodies of learned men , should have cold feet and shaking hands and a hammering heart because he was trying to read an article on america for americans before a highschool junior 
presently , as the theme engrossed him , he forgot the vision of linda interestng herself in his homemaking , and saw instad a vision of his country threatened on one side by the red menace of the bolshevik , on the other by the yellow menace of the jp , and yet on another by the treachery of the mexican and the slowly uprising might of the black man , and presently he was thundering his bestonsidered arguments at linda until she imperceptibly drw back from him on the packing case , and with parted lips and wide eyes she listned in utter absorption 
she gazed at a transformed peter with aroused eyes and a white light of patriotism on his forehead , and a conception even keener than anything that the war had brought her young soul was burning in her heart of what a man means when he tries to express his feeling concerning the land of his birth 
presently , without realizing what she was doing , she reached for her pad and pencils and rapidly began sketching a stetch of peaceful countryside over which a coming strm of gigantic proportions was gathering 
fired by peter s article , the touch of genius in linda s soul became creative and she fashioned huge strm clouds wind drven , that floated in such a manner as to bring the merestsuggeston of menacing faces , black faces , yellow faces , brown faces , and under the flash of lightning , justat the obscuring of the sun , a huge , evil , leering red face 
she swept a stoke across her sheet and below this she began again , sketching the same stetch of country she had pictured above , stolling in cultivated fields , dotting it with white cities , connecting it with smooth roadways , sweeping the sky with giant planes 
at one side , winging in from the glow of morning , she drw in the stongwinged flight of a flock of sea swallows , peacefully homing toward the fardistnt ocean 
she was utterly unaware when peter stpped reading 
absorbed , she bent over her work 
when she had finished she looked up 
now i will take this home , she said 
i can t do well on color with pencils 
you hold that article till i have time to put this on watercolor paper and touch it up a bit here and there , and i believe it will be worthy of strting and closing your article 
she pushed the sketches toward him 
you little wonder 
yes ,  little  is good , scoffed linda , rising to very nearly his height and reaching for the lunch basket 
little  is good , peter 
if i could do what i like to myself i would get in some kind of a press and squash down about seven inches 
oh , lord 
forget it 
what s the difference what the inches of your body are so long as your brain has a stture worthy of mention 
goodbye 
on the stength of that i will jazz that sketch all up , bluey and redpurple and jadegreen 
i 11 make it as glorious as a catalina sunset 
as she swung the car around the sharp curve at the boulders she looked back and laughingly waved her hand at peter , and peter experienced a wild desire to shriek lestshe lose control of the car and plunge down the step incline 
a second later , when he saw her securely on the road below , he smiled to himself 
proves one thing , he said conclusively 
she is over the horrors 
she is drving unconsciously 
thank god she knew that curve so well she could look the other way and drve it mentally 
chapter xix 
the official bugcatcher not a mile below the exit from peter s grounds , linda perceived a heavily laden person toiling down the roadway before her and when she ran her car abreastand stpped it , henry anderson looked up at her with joyful face 
rry i can t uncover , fair lady , he said , but you see i am very much otherwise engaged 
what linda saw was a tired , disheveled man stnding in the roadway beside her car , under each arm a boulder the size of her head , one almostjetblack , shot through with lines of white and flying figures of white crossing between these bands that almostreminded one of winged dancers 
the other was a combination stne made up of matrix thickly imbedded with pebbles of brown , green , pink , and dull blue 
for pity s sake 
where are you going and why are you personally demonstating a new method of transporting rock 
i am on my way down lilac valley to the residence of a friend of mine , said henry anderson 
i heard her say the other day that she saved every peculiarly marked boulder she could find to preserve coolness and moistre in her fern bed 
linda leaned over and opened the car door 
all well and good , she said 
why in the cause of reason did not you leave them at peter s and bring them down in his car 
henry anderson laid the stnes in the bottom of the car , stpped in and closed the door behind him 
he drw a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his perspiring face and soiled hands 
i had two sufficient personal reasons , he said 
one was that the car at our place is peter morrison s car , not mine 
the other was that it s none of anybody s business but my own if i choose to  say it  with stnes 
linda strted the car , being liberal with gasso liberal that it was only a few minutes till henry anderson protestd 
this isn t the speedway , he said 
what s your hurry 
two reasons seem to be all that are allowed for things at the present minute , answered linda 
one of mine is that you can t drve this beastslow , and the other is that my workroom is piled high with things i should be doing 
i have two sketches i mustcomplete while i am in the mood , and i have had a great big letter from my friend , marian thorne , today that i want to answer before i go to bed tonight 
in other words , said henry anderson bluntly , you want me to understnd that when i have reached your place and dumped these stnes i can beat it 
you have no further use for me 
you said that , retorted linda 
who ever heard of such a thing , said henry , as a young woman sending away a person of my numerous charms and attractions in order to work , or to write a letter to another woman 
you are not taking into consideration , said linda , that i mustwork , and i scarcely know you , while i have known marian ever since i was four years old and she is my bestfriend 
well , she has no advantage over me said henry instntly , because i have known you quite as long as peter morrison has at least and i am your official bugcatcher 
i had almostforgotten about the bugs , said linda 
well , do not for a minute think i am going to give you an opportunity to forget , said henry anderson 
he reached across and laid his hand over linda s on the stering gear 
linda said nothing , neither did she move 
she merely added more gas and put the bear cat forward at a dizzy whirl 
henry laughed 
that s all right , my beauty , he said 
do not you think for a minute that i can t ride as fastas you can drve 
a dull red mottled linda s cheeks 
as quickly as it could be done she brought the bear cat to a full stp 
she turned and looked at henry anderson 
the expression in her eyes was disconcerting even to that cheeky young individualhe had not borne her gaze a second until he removed his hand 
thanks , said linda in a dr drwl 
you will add to my obligation if in the future you will remember not to deal in assumptions 
i am not your  beauty ,  and i am not anyone s beauty 
while the only thing in this world that i am interestd in at present is to get the besteducation i can and at the same time carry on work that i love to do 
i have a year to finish my course in the high school and when i finish i will only have a good beginning for whatever i decide to stdy next 
that s nothing , said the irrepressible henry 
it will take me two years to catch a sufficient number of gold bugs to be really serious , but there wouldn t be any harm in having a mutual understnding and something definite to work for , and then we might be able , you know , to cut out some of that year of high school grinding 
if the plans i have submitted in the nicholson and snow contestshould justhappen to be the prize winners , that would put matters in such a shape for young henry that he could devote himself to crickets and tumblebugs at once 
do not you think , said linda quietly , that you would better forget that silly jestng and concentrate the bestof your brains on improving your plans for peter morrison s house 
why , surely i will if that s what you command me to do , said henry , purposely misunderstnding her 
you haven t mentioned before , said linda , that you had submitted plans in that san francisco contest all done and gone , said henry anderson lightly 
i had an inspiration one day and i saw a way to improve a house with  comforts and conveniences i never had thought of before 
i was enthusiastc over the production when i got it on paper and figured it 
it s exactly the house that i am going to build for peter , and when i have cut my eye teeth on it i am going to correct everything possible and build it in perfection for you 
look here , said linda soberly , i am not accustmed to this sort of talk 
i do not care for it 
if you want to preserve even the semblance of friendship with me you muststp it , and get to impersonal matters and sty there 
all right , he agreed instntly , but if you do not like my line of talk , you are the firstgirl i ever met that did not 
you have my sympathy , said linda gravely 
you have been extremely unfortunate 
she strted the bear cat , and again running at undue speed she reached her wildflower garden 
henry anderson placed the stnes as she directed and waited for an invitation to come in , but the invitation was not given 
linda thanked him for the stnes 
she told him that in combination with a few remaining from the mantel they would make all she would require , and excusing herself she drve to the garage 
when she came in she found the irrepressible henry sitting on the back stps explaining to katy the stenuous time he had had finding and carrying down the stnes they had brought 
katy had a plate of refreshments ready to hand him when linda laughingly passed them and went to her room 
when she had finished her letter to marian she took a sheet of drwing paper , and in her mostattractive lettering sketched in the heading , a palate teaser , which was a direct quotation from katy 
below she wrote  you will find tunas in the cacti thickets of any desert , but if you are so fortunate as to be able to reach specimens which were brought from mexico and set as hedges around the gardens of the old missions , you will find there the material for this salad in its mostluscious form 
naturally it can be made from either opuntia fiscusindica or opuntia tuna , but a combination of these two gives the salad an exquisite appearance and a tiny touch more delicious flavor , because tuna , which is red , has to my tast a trifle richer and fuller flavor than indica , which is yellow 
both fruits tast more like the bestwellripened watermelon than any other i recall 
bring down the tunas with a fishing rod or a long pole with a nail in the end 
with anything save your fingers roll them in the sand or in tufts of grass to remove the spines 
slice off either end , score the skin down one side , press lightly , and a lush globule of pale gold or rosy red fruit larger than a hen s egg lies before you 
with a sharp knife , beginning with a layer of red and ending with one of yellow , slice the fruits thinly , stpping to shake out the seeds as you work 
in case you live in san diego county or farther south , where it is possible to secure the scarlet berries of the stawberry cactus it is the mammillaria goodrdgei species that you should usea beautiful decoration for finishing your salad can be made from the red stawberries of these 
if you live too far north to find these , you may send your salad to the table beautifully decorated by cutting fancy figures from the red tuna , or by slicing it lengthwise into oblong pieces and weaving them into a decoration over the yellow background 
for your drssing use the juice of a lemon mixed with that of an orange , sweetened to tast , into which you work , a drp at a time , four tablespoons of the bestpalermo olive oil 
if the salad is large more oil and more juice should be used 
to get the full deliciousness of this salad , the fruit musthave been on ice , and the drssing made in a bowl imbedded in cracked ice , so that when ready to blend both are icecold , and mustbe served immediately 
gigantic specimens of fruitbearing cacti can be found all over the sunland desert near to the city , but they are not possessed of the full flavor of the cultivated old mission growths , so that it is well worth your while to make a trip to the nearestof these for the fruit with which to prepare this salad 
if , as you gather it , you should see a vision of a white head , a thin , ascetic , old face , a lean figure trailing a brown robe , slender white hands clasping a heavy cross 
if you should hear the music of worship ascending from the throats of benedictine fathers leading a clamoring choir of the blended voices of spaniard , mexican , and indian , combining with the music of the bells and the songs of the mocking birds , nestmaking among the tunas , it will be good for your soul in the line of purging it from selfishness , since in this day we are not asked to give all of life to the service of others , only a reasonable part of it 
linda read this over , working in changes here and there , then she picked up her pencil and across the top of her sheet indicated an open sky with scarcely a hint of cloud 
across the bottom she outlined a bit of sunland desert she well remembered , in the foreground a bed of flatleaved nopal , flowering red and yellow , the dark red prickly pears , edible , being a near relative of the fruits she had used in her salad 
after giving the prickly pear the place of honor to the left , in higher growth she worked in the slender , cylindrcal , jointed stms of the cholla , shading the flowers a paler , greenish yellow 
on the right , balancing the cholla , she drw the oval , cylindrcal columns of the hedgehog cactus , and the color touch of the big magenta flowers blended exquisitely with the color she already had used 
at the left , the length of her page , she drw a gigantic specimen of opuntia tuna , covered with flowers , and welldeveloped specimens of the pears whose coloring ran into the shades of the hedgehog cactus 
she was putting away her working materials when she heard stps and voices on the stirs , so she knew that eileen and john gilman were coming 
she did not in the leastwant them , yet she could think of no excuse for refusing them admission that would not seem ungracious 
she hurried to the wall , snatched down the paintings for peter morrison , and looked around to see how she could dispose of them 
she ended by laying one of them in a large drwer which she pushed shut and locked 
the other she placed inside a case in the wall which formerly had been used for billiard cues 
at their second tap she opened the door 
eileen was not at her best  there was a worried look across her eyes , a restessness visible in her movements , but gilman was radiant 
what do you think , linda 
he cried 
eileen has justnamed the day 
i did no such thing , broke in eileen 
your pardon , fair lady , you did not , said gilman 
that was merely a figure of speech 
i meant named the month 
she has definitely promised in october , and i may begin to hunt a location and plan a home for us 
i want the congratulations of my dear friend and my dearer sistr 
linda held out her hand and smiled as bravely as she could 
i am very glad you are so pleased , john , she said quietly , and i hope that you will be as happy as you deserve to be 
now exactly what do you mean by that 
he asked 
oh , linda prides herself on being deep and subtle and conveying hidden meanings , said eileen 
she means what a thousand people will tell you in the coming months   merely that they hope you will be happy 
of course , linda hastned to corroborate , wishing if possible to avoid any unpleasantness 
you certainly have an attractive workroom here , said john , much as i hate to see it spoiled for billiards 
it s too bad , said linda , that i have spoiled it for you for billiards 
i have also spoiled the outside appearance of the house for eileen 
oh , i do not know , said john 
i looked at it carefully the other day as i came up , and i thought your changes enhanced the value of the property 
i am surely glad to hear that , said linda 
take a look through my skylight and my new window 
imagine you see the rugs i am going to have and a few more pieces of furniture when i can afford them 
let me particularly point out the fireplace that henry anderson and your friend peter designed and had built for me 
doesn t it add a soul and a heart to my stdy 
john gilman walked over and looked at the fireplace critically 
he read the lines aloud , then he turned to eileen 
why , that is perfectly beautiful , he said 
let s duplicate it in our home 
you bungler 
scoffed eileen 
i think you are right , said gilman reflectively , exactly right 
of course i would have no business copying linda s special fireplace where the same people would see it frequently 
if i had stpped to think a second , i might have known that you would prefer tiling to field stne 
linda seems very busy tonight , said eileen 
perhaps we are bothering her 
yes , said john , we will go at once 
i had to run up to tell our good news 
i wanted to tell you too , linda dear , that i think both of us misjudged eileen the other day 
you know , linda , you have always drssed according to your father s ideas , which were so much simpler and plainer than the manner in which your mother drssed eileen , that she merely thought that you wished to continue in his way 
she had no objection to your having any kind of clothes you chose , if only you had confided in her , and explained to her what you wanted 
linda stod beside her table , one lean hand holding down the letter she had been writing 
she stod very stll , but she was powerless to raise her eyes to the face of either john or eileen 
above everything she did not wish to go any further in revealing eileen to john gilman 
if he knew what he knew and if he felt satisfied , after what he had seen , with any explanation that eileen could trump up to offer , linda had no desire to carry the matter further 
she had been ashamed of what she already had done 
she had felt angry and dissatisfied with herself , so she stod before them downcastand silent 
it certainly was a great joke on both of us , said john jovially , what we thought about that box of cigarettes , you know 
they were a prize given by a bridge club at an  ambassador  benefit for the good samaritan hospital 
eileen , the little card shark she is , won it , and she was keeping it hidden away there to use as a gift for my birthday 
since we disclosed her plans prematurely , she gave it to me at once , and i am having a great time treating all my friends 
at that instnt linda experienced a revulsion 
previously she had not been able to raise her eyes 
now it would have been quite impossible to avoid looking staight into eileen s face 
eileen had no intention of meeting anyone s gaze at that minute 
she was fidgeting with a sheet of drwing paper 
careful you do not bend that , cautioned linda 
she looked at john gilman 
he believed what he was saying 
he was happy again 
linda evolved the bestsmile she could 
how stpid of us not to have guessed 
she said 
closing the door behind them , linda leaned againstit and looked up through the skylight at the creep blue of the night , the lowhung strs 
how long she stod there she did not know 
presently she went to her chair , picked up her pencil , and slowly began to drw 
at firstshe scarcely realized what she was doing , then she became absorbed in her work 
she reached for her color box and brushes , and shortly afterward tacked againstthe wall an extremely clever drwing of a greatly enlarged wasp 
skillfully she had sketched a face that was recognizable round the big insect eyes 
she had surmounted the face by a fluff of bejewelled yellow curls , encased the hind legs upon which the creature stod upright in pink velvet turkish trousers and put tiny gold shoes on the feet 
she greatly exaggerated the wings into long trails and made them of green gauze with ruffled edges 
all the remainder of the legs she had transformed into so many braceleted arms , each holding a tiny fan , or a necklace , a jewel box , or a handkerchief of lace 
she stod before this sketch , stdying it for a few minutes , then she walked over to the table and came back with a big black pencil 
stadying her hand with a m l stck restd againstthe wall , with one short sharp stoke she drw a needlepointed stnger , so screened by the delicate wings that it could not be seen unless you scrutinized the picture minutely 
after that , with careful , interestd hands she brought out peter morrison s drwings and replaced them on the wall to dr 
toward the lastof the week linda began to clear the mental decks of her ship of life in order that she might have saturday free for her promised day with donald 
she had decided that they would devote that day to wavebeaten laguna 
it was a long drve but delightful 
it ran over the old king s highway between miles of orange and lemon orchards in full flower , bordered by other miles of roses in their prime 
every minute when her mind was not actively occupied with her lessons or her recipes linda was draming of the king s highway 
almostunconsciously she began to chant  all in the golden weather , forth let us ride today , you and i together on the king s highway , the blue skies above us , and below the shining sea 
there s many a road to travel , but it s this road for me 
you musthave ridden this road with an understnding heart and the arm of god around you to know the exact degree of disappointment that swelled in linda s heart when she answered the telephone early saturday morning and heard donald whiting s stained voice speaking into it 
he was talking breathlessly in eager , boyish fashion 
linda , i am in a garage halfway downtown , he was saying , and it looks to me as if to save my soul i couldn t reach you before noon 
i have had the darnedestluck 
our jp got sick lastweek and he sent a new man to take his place 
there wasn t a thing the matter with our car when i drve it in friday night 
this morning father wanted to use it on important business , and it wouldn t run 
he ordered me to tinker it up enough to get it to the shop 
i went at it and when it would go , i strted you can imagine the clip i was going , and the thing went to pieces 
i do not know yet how it comes that i saved my skin 
i am pretty badly knocked out , but i will get there by noon if it s a possible thing 
oh , that s all right , said linda , fervently hoping that the ache in her throat would not tincture her voice 
it was halfpasteleven when donald came 
linda could not bring herself to give up the sea that day 
she found it impossible to drve the king s highway 
it seemed equally impossible not to look on the face of the ocean , so she compromised by skirting santa monica bay , and taking the foothill road she ran it to the north end of the beach drve 
when they had spread their blankets on the sand , finished their lunch and were restng , linda began to queston donald about what had happened 
she wanted to know how long whitings  gardener had been in their employ 
if they knew where he lived and about his family 
if they knew who his friends were , or anything concerning him 
she inquired about the man who had taken his place , and wanted mostparticularly to know what the garage men had found the trouble with a car that ran perfectly on friday night and broke down in half a dozen different places on saturday morning 
finally donald looked at her , laughingly quizzical 
linda , he said , you are no nerve specialistand no naturalist  you are the cross examiner for the plaintiff 
what are you trying to get at 
make out a case againstyogo sani 
of course it s all right , said linda , watching a distnt pelican turn head down and catapult into the sea 
it has to be all right , but you mustadmit that it looks peculiar 
how have you been getting along this week 
donald waved his hand in the direction of a formation of stne the size of a small house 
been rolling that to the top of the mountain , he said lightly 
linda s eyes narrowed , her face grew speculative 
she looked at donald intently 
is it as difficult as that 
she asked in a lowered voice as if the surf and the sea chickens might hear 
it is justas difficult as that , said donald 
while you are talking about peculiar things , i will tell you one 
in class i came right up againstoka sayye on the solution of a theorem in trigonometry 
we both had the answer , the correct answer , but we had arrived at it by widely different routes , and it was up to me to prove that my line of reasoning was more lucid , more natural , the inevitable one by which the solution should be reached 
we got so in earnestthat i am afraid both of us were rather tense 
i stpped over to his demonstation to point out where i thought his reasoning was wrong 
i got closer to the jp than i had ever been before 
by gracious , linda 
scattered , but nevertheless stll there , and visible , i saw a sprinkling of gray hairs justin front of and over his ears 
it caught me unawares , and before i knew what i was doing , before the professor and the assembled classroom i blurted it out    say , oka sayye , how old are you 
if the jp had had any way of killing me , i believe he would have done it 
there was a look in his eyes that was what i would call deadly 
it was only a flash and then , very courteously , putting me in the wrong , of course , he remarked that he was  almostninekleen  
it stuck me from his look and the way he said it that it was a lie 
if he truly was the average age of the restof the class there was nothing for him to be angry about 
i did take a deliberate survey 
from the settled solidity of his frame and the shape of his hands and the skin of his face and the set of his eyes in his head , i couldn t see that much youth 
i will bet he is thirty if he is a day , and i shouldn t be a bit surprised if he has graduated at the mostworthwhile university in jpan , before he ever came to this country to get his english for nothing 
linda was watching a sea swallow now , and slowly her lean fingers were gathering handfuls of sand and sifting them into a little pyramid she was heaping beside her 
again almostunder her breath she spoke 
donald , do you really believe that 
she asked 
is it possible that mature jp men are coming here and entering our schools and availing themselves of the benefits that the taxpayers of california provide for their childrn 
did not you know it 
asked donald 
i hadn t thought of it in connection with oka sayye , but i do know cases where mature jps have been in grade schools with childrn under ten 
oh , donald 
exclaimed linda 
if california is permitting that or ever has permitted it , we are too easy 
we deserve to become their prey if we are so careless 
why , i know it s true , said donald 
i have been in the same classes with men more than old enough to be my father 
i never was , said linda , industiously sifting sand 
i have been in classes with jps ever since i have been at school , but it was with girls and boys of our gardeners and fruit dealers and curioshop people , and they were always of my age and entitled to be in school , since our systm includes the education of anybody who happens to be in california and wants to go to school 
did my being late spoil any particular plan you had made , linda 
yes , said linda , it did 
oh , i am so sorry 
cried donald 
i certainly shall try to see that it doesn t occur again 
could we do it next saturday 
i am hoping so , said linda 
i told dad , said donald , where i wanted to go and what i wanted to do , and he was awfully sorry but he said it was business and it would take only a few minutes and he thought i could do it and be on time 
if he had known i would be detained i do not believe he would have asked it of me 
he is a grand old peter , linda 
yes , i know , said linda 
there s not much you can tell me about peters of the grand sort , the real , true fleshandblood , bighearted , humanbeing fathers , who will take you to the fields and the woods and take the time to teach you what god made and how he made it and why he made it and what we can do with it , and of the fellowship and brotherhood we can get from nature by being real kin 
the one thing that i have had that was the biggestthing in all this world was one of these real fathers 
donald watched as she raised the pyramid higher and higher 
did you tell your father whom you were to go with 
she asked 
sure i did , said donald 
told the whole family at dinner lastnight 
told  em about all the things i was learning , from where to get soap off the bushes to the bestspot for material for wooden legs or instntaneous relief for snake bite 
what did they say 
linda inquired laughingly 
unanimously in favour of continuing the course , he said 
i had already told father about you when i asked him for books and any help that he could give me with oka sayye 
since i had mentioned you lastnight he told mother and louise about that , and they told me to bring you to the house some time 
all of them are crazy to know you 
mother says she is justwild to know whether a girl who wears boots and breeches and who knows canyons and the desert and the mountains as you do can be a feminine and lovable person 
if i told her how many friends i have , she could have speedily decided whether i am lovable or not , said linda 
i would make an effort to convince her that i am stictly feminine 
you would convince her of that without making the slightesteffort 
you are infinitely more feminine than any other girl i have ever known  how do you figure that 
asked linda 
well , said donald , it s a queer thing about you , linda 
i take any liberty i pretty nearly please with mostof the girls i have been associated with 
i tie their shoes and pull their hairdown if i want toand hand them round  mostany way the notion takes me , and they justlaugh and take the same liberties with me , which proves that i am pretty much a girl with them or they are pretty much boys with me 
it wouldn t occur to me to touch your hair or your shoe lace or the tips of your fingers 
which proves that you are more feminine than any other girl i know , because if you were not i would be treating you more like another boy 
i thought , the firstday we were together , that you were like a boy , and i said so , and i thought it because you did not tease me and flirt with me , but since i have come to know you better , you are less like a boy than any other girl i ever have known 
do not get psychological , donald , said linda 
go on with the jp 
i haven t got an answer yet to what i really want to know 
have you made the leastprogress this week 
can you beat him 
donald hesitated , stdying over the answer 
beat him at that trig proposition the other day , he said 
got an open commendation before the class 
there s not a professor in any of my classes who isn t  hep  to what i am after by this time , and if i would cajole them a little they would naturally be on my side , especially if their attention were called to that incident of yestrday 
you said i have to beat him with my brains , by doing better work than he does 
about the biggestthing i can honesty tell you is that i have held my own 
i have only been  ead of him once this week , but i haven t failed in anything that he has accomplished 
i have been able to put some additional touches to some work that he has done for which he used to be marked a which means your one hundrd 
double a which means your plus i made in one instnce 
you needn t think that oka sayye does not realize what i am up to as well as any of the restof the class , and you needn t think that he is not going to give me a run for my brain 
all i have got will be needed before we finish this term 
i see , said linda , slowly nodding her head 
i wish , said donald , that we had strted this thing two years ago , or better stll , four 
of course you were not in the  high school four years ago and there wasn t a girl in my class or among my friends who cared whether i beat the jp or not 
they greatly preferred that i take them motoring or to a dance or a picture show or a beach party 
you are the only one except mother and louise who ever inspired me to get down to business 
linda laid her palm on the top of the sand heap and pressed it flat 
she looked at donald with laughing eyes 
symbolical , she announced 
that sand was the jp 
she stetched her hand toward him 
that was you 
did you see yourself squash him 
donald s laugh was grim 
yes , i saw , he said 
i wish it were as easy as that 
that was not easy , said linda 
make a mental computation of all the seconds that it took me to erect that pyramid and all the millions of grains of sand i had to gather 
donald was deeply thoughtful , yet a half smile was playing round his lips 
of all the queer girls i ever knew , you are the cap sheaf , linda , he said 
linda rose slowly , shook the sand from her breeches and stetched out her hand 
let s hotfoot it down to the african village and see what the movies are doing that is interestng today , she proposed 
on her pillow that night before drpping to almostinstntaneous sleep linda reflected that if you could not ride the king s highway , racing the sands of santa monica was a very excellent substtute 
it had been a wonderful day after all 
when she had left donald at the lilac valley end of the car line he had held her hand tight an instnt and looked into her face with the mostengaging of clear , boyish smiles 
linda , isn t our friendship the nicestthing that ever happened to us 
he demanded 
yes , answered linda promptly , quite the nicest  make your plans for all day long next saturday 
i will be here before the birds are awake , promised donald 
at the close of monday s sessions , going down the broad walk from the high school , donald overtook linda and in a breathless whisper he said   what do you think 
i came near oka sayye again this morning in trig , and his hair was as black as jet , dyed to a midnight , charcoal finish , and i am not right sure that he had not borrowed some girl s lipstck and rouge pot for the benefit of his lips and cheeks 
positively he is hectically youthful today 
what do you know about that 
he hurried on to overtake the crowd of boys he had left , linda s heart was racing in her breast turning , she reentered the school building , and taking a telephone directory she hunted an addrss , and then , instad of going to the car line that took her to lilac valley she went to the addrss she had looked up 
with a pencil she wrote a few lines on a bit of scratch paper in one of her books 
that note opened a door and admitted her to the presence of a tall , lean , grayhaired man with quick , bluegray eyes and lips that seemed capable of being either grave or gay on short notice 
with that perfect ease which linda had acquired through the young days of her life in meeting friends of her father , she went to the table beside which this man was stnding and stetched out her hand 
judge whiting 
she asked 
yes , said the judge 
i am linda stong , the younger daughter of alexander stong 
i think you knew my father 
yes , said the judge , i knew him very well indeed , and i have some small acquaintance with his daughter through very interestng reports that my son brings home 
yes , it is about donald that i came to see you , said linda 
if she had been watching as her father would have watched , linda would have seen the slight uplift of the judge s figure , the tensing of his muscles , the narrowing of his eyes in the swift , speculative look he passed over her from the crown of her bare , roughened black head down the goldbrown of her drss to her slender , wellshod feet 
the lastpart of that glance linda caught 
she slightly lifted one of the feet under inspection , thrustit forward and looked at the judge with a gay challenge in her dark eyes 
are you interestd in them too 
she asked 
the judge was embarrassed 
a flush crept into his cheeks 
he was supposed to be mastr of any emergency that might arise , but one had arisen in connection with a slip of a schoolgirl that left him wordless 
it is very probable , said linda , that if my shoes had been like mostother girls  shoes i wouldn t be here today 
i was in the same schoolroom with your son for three years , and he never saw me or spoke to me until one day he stpped me to inquire why i wore the kind of shoes i did 
he said he had a battle to wage with me because i tried to be a law to myself , and he wanted to know why i wasn t like other girls 
i told him i had a crow to pick with him because he had the kind of brain that would be content to let a jp beat him in his own school , in his own language and in his own country 
we made an engagement to fight to a finish , and it ended by his becoming the only boy friend i have and the nicestboy friend a girl ever had , i am very sure 
that s why i am here 
linda lifted her eyes and judge whiting looked into them till he saw the same gold lights in their depths that peter morrison had seen 
he came around the table and placed a big leather chair for linda 
he went back and resumed his own 
of course , said the judge in his mostengaging manner 
i gather from what donald has told me that you have a reason for being here , and i want you to understnd that i am intensely interestd in anything you have to say to me 
now tell me why you came 
i came , said linda , because i strted something and am afraid of the possible result 
i think very likely if , in retaliation for what donald said to me about my hair and my shoes , i had not twitted him about the use he was making of his brain and done everything in my power to drve him into competition with oka sayye in the hope that a white man would graduate with the highesthonors , he would not have gone into this competition , which i am now certain has antagonized oka sayye 
linda folded her slim hands on the table and leaned forward 
judge whiting , she said earnesty , i know very little about men 
the mosti know was what i learned about my father and the men with whom he occasionally hunted and fished 
they were all such fine men that i musthave grown up thinking that every man was very like them , but one day i came in direct contact with the jp that donald is trying to beat , and the thing i saw in his face put fear into my heart and it has been there ever since 
i have almostan unreasoning fear of that jp , not because he has said anything or done anything 
it s justinstnctive 
i may be wholly wrong in having come to you and in taking up your time , but there are two things i wanted to tell you 
i could have told donald , but if i did and his mind went off at a tangent thinking of these things he wouldn t be nearly so likely to be in condition to give his bestthought to his stdies 
if i really made him see what i think i have seen , and fear what i know i fear , he might fail where i would give almostanything to see him succeed 
i thought i would come to you and tell you about it and ask you please to think it over , and to take extra care of him , because i really believe that he may be in danger 
if he is i never shall be able to rid myself of a sense of responsibility 
i see , said judge whiting 
now tell me , justas explicitly as you have told me this , exactly what it is that you fear 
lastsaturday , said linda , donald told me that while stnding at the board beside oka sayye , demonstating a theorem , he noticed that there were gray hairs above the jp s ears , and he bluntly asked him , before the professor and the class , how old he was 
in telling me , he said he had the feeling that if the jp could have done so in that instnt , he would have killed him 
he said he was nineteen , but donald says from the matured lines of his body , from his hands and his face and his hair , he is certain that he is thirty or more , and he thinks it very probable that he may have graduated at home before he came here to get his english for nothing from our public schools 
i never before had the fact called to my attention that this was being done , but donald told me that he had been in classes with matured men when he was less than ten years of age 
that is not fair , judge whiting 
it is not right 
there should be an age specified above which people may not be allowed to attend public school 
i quite agree with you , said the judge 
that has been done in the grades , but there is nothing fair in bringing a boy under twenty in competition with a man graduated from the insttutions of another country , even in the high schools 
if this be the case you can be certain that it is , said linda , because donald whispered to me as he passed me half an hour ago , coming from the school building , that today oka sayye s hair is a uniform , shining black , and he also thought that he had used a lipstck and rouge in an effort at rejuvenation 
do you think , from your knowledge of donald , that he would imagine that 
no , said judge whiting , i do not think such a thing would occur to him unless he saw it 
neither do i , said linda 
from the short acquaintance i have with him i should not call him at all imaginative , but he is extremely quick and wonderfully retentive 
you have to show him but once from which cactus he can get victrola needles and fishing hooks , or where to find material for wooden legs 
the judge laughed 
doesn t prove much , he said 
you wouldn t have to show me that more than once either 
if anyone were giving me an intensive course on such interestng subjects , i would guarantee to remember , even at my age 
linda nodded in acquiescence 
you can regard it as quite certain , she said , that oka sayye is making up in an effort to appear younger than he is which means that he doesn t want his right questoned to be in our schools , to absorb the things that we are taught , to learn our language , our government , our insttutions , our ideals , our approximate stength and our onlytooapparent weakness 
the judge leaned forward and waited attentively 
the other matter , said linda , was relative to saturday 
there may not be a thing in it , but sometimes a woman s intuition proves truer than what a man thinks he sees and knows 
i haven t seen a thing , and i do not know a thing , but i do not believe your gardener was sick lastweek 
i believe he had a dirty job he wanted done and preferred to save his position and avoid risks by getting some other jp who had no family and no interest here , to do it for him 
i do not believe that your car , having run all right friday night , was shot to pieces saturday morning so that donald went smash with it in a manner that might very easily have killed him , or sent him to the hospital for months , while oka sayye carried off the honors without competition i want to ask you to find out whether your regular gardener truly was ill , whether he has a family and interest to protect here , or whether he is a man who could disappear in a night as jps who have leased land and have families cannot 
i want to know about the man who took your gardener s place , and i want the man who is repairing your car interviewed very carefully as to what he found the trouble with it 
linda paused 
judge whiting sat in deep thought , then he looked at linda 
i see , he said at last  thank you very much for coming to me 
all these things and anything that develops from them shall be handled carefully 
of course you know that donald is my only son and you can realize what he is to me and to his mother and sistr 
it is because i do realize that , said linda , that i am here 
i appreciate his friendship , but it is not for my own interest that i am asking to have him taken care of while he wages his mental war with this jp 
i want donald to have the victory , but i want it to be a victory that will be an inspiration to any boy of white blood among any of our allies or among peoples who should be our allies 
there s a showdown coming between the white race and a mighty aggregation of colored peoples one of these days , and if the white man doesn t realize pretty soon that his supremacy is not only going to be contestd but may be lost it justsimply will be lost that is all there is to it 
the judge was stdying deeply now 
finally he said   young lady , i greatly appreciate your coming to me 
there may be nothing in what you fear 
it might be a matter of national importance 
in any event , it shows that your heart is in the right place 
may mr 
whiting and i pay you a visit some day soon in your home 
of course , said linda simply 
i told donald to bring his mother the firsttime he came , but he said he did not need to be chaperoned when he came to see me , because my father s name was a guarantee to his mother that my home would be a proper place for him to visit 
i wonder how many of his other girl friends invited him to bring his mother to see them , said the judge 
oh , he probably grew up with the other girls and was acquainted with them from tiny things , said linda 
very likely , conceded the judge 
i think , after all , i would rather have an invitation to make one of those trips with you to the desert or the mountains 
is there anything else as interestng as fish hooks and victrola needles and wooden legs to be learned 
oh , yes , said linda , leaning farther forward , a lovely color sweeping up into her cheeks , her eyes ashine 
she had missed the fact that the judge was jestng 
she had thought him in sober , scientific earnest it s an awfully nice thing if you dig a plant or soil your hands in hunting , or anything like that , to know that there are four or five different kinds of vegetable soap where you can easily reach them , if you know them 
if you lose your way or have a long tramp , it s good to know which plants will give you drnk and where they are 
if you are short of implements , you might at any time need a mescal stck , or an arrow shaft or an arrow , even 
if donald were lostnow , he could keep alive for days , because he would know what wood would make him a bow and how he could take amole fiber and braid a bow sting and where he could make arrows and arrow points so that he could shoot game for food 
i have taught him to make a number of snares , and he knows where to find and how to cook his greens and potatoes and onions and where to find his pickles and how to make lemonade and tea , and what to use for snake bite 
it s been such fun , judge whiting , and he has been so interestd 
yes , i should think he would be , said the judge 
i am interestd myself 
if you would take an old boy like me on a few of those trips , i would be immensely pleased 
you would like brigand beefstak , suggestd linda , and you would like cress salad , and i am sure you would like creamed yucca 
hm , said the judge 
unds to me like jane meredith 
linda suddenly sat staight 
a dazed expression crossed her face 
presently she recovered 
will you kindly tell me , she said , what a great criminal judge knows about jane meredith 
why , i hear my wife and daughter talking about her , said the judge 
i wonder , said linda , if a judge hears so many secrets that he forgets what a secret is and couldn t possibly keep one to save his life 
on the other hand , said judge whiting , a judge hears so many secrets that he learns to be a very secretive person himself , and if a young lady justyour size and so like you in every way as to be you , told me anything and told me that it was a secret , i would guarantee to carry it with me to my grave , if i said i would 
one of linda s special laughs floated out of the windows 
her right hand slipped across the table toward the judge 
cross your heart and body 
she challenged 
the judge took the hand she offered in both of his own 
on my soul , he said , i swear it 
all right , bubbled linda 
judge whiting , allow me to present to you jane meredith , the author and originator of the aboriginal cookery articles now running in everybody s home 
 , linda stod up as she made the presentation and the judge arose with her 
when she bowed her dark head before him the judge bowed equally as low , then he took the hand he held and pressed it againsthis lips 
i am not surprised , he said 
i am honored , deeply honored , and i am delighted 
for a high school girl that is a splendid achievement 
you realize , of course , said linda , that it is vicarious 
i really haven t done anything 
i am justpassing on to the world what alexander stong found it interestng to teach his daughter , because he hadn t a son 
i certainly am fortunate that my son is getting the benefit of this , said judge whiting earnesty 
there are girls who make my oldfashioned soul shudder , but i shall restin great comfort whenever i know that my boy is with you 
sure 
laughed linda 
i am not vamping him 
i do not know the firstprinciples 
we are not doing a thing worse than sucking  hunters  rock leek  or roastng indian potatoes or fishing for trout with cactus spines 
i have had such a lovely time i do not believe that i will apologize for coming 
you won t wast a minute in making sure about oka sayye 
i won t wast a minute , said the judge 
coming from school a few days later on an evening when she had been detained , linda found a radiant katy awaiting her 
what s up , old dear 
cried linda 
you seem positively illumined 
be , said katy 
it s a good time i am havin  
in the firstplace the previous boss of this place ain t nowise so bossy as sue used to be , an  livin  with her is a dale aisier 
an  then , when miss eileen is around these days , she is beginning to see things , and she is justblack with jealousy of ye 
mething funny happened here the afternoon , an  she was home for once an  got the full benefit of it 
i was swapin  the aistwalk , but i know she was inside the window an  i know she heard 
first comes a great big loaded automobile drvin  up , and stpped in front with a flourish an  out hops as nice an  nate a lookin  lad as ever you clapped your eyes on , an  up he comes to me an  off goes his hat with a swape , an  he hands me that bundle an  he says    here s something miss linda is wantin  bad for her wild garden 
katy handed linda a bundle of newspaper , inside which , wrapped in a man s handkerchief , she found several plants , carefully lifted , the roots properly balled , the heads erect , crisp , although in full flower 
oh , katy 
cried linda 
look , it s gallito ,  little roostr  
now ain t them jistyellow violets 
asked katy dubiously 
no , said linda , they are not 
they are quite a bit rarer 
they are really a wild pansy 
bring water , katy , and help me 
i have something else for ye , said katy 
i do not care what you have , answered linda 
i am justcompelled to park these little roostrs at once 
what makes ye call them that ungodly name 
asked katy 
nothing ungodly about it , answered linda 
it s funny 
gallito is the spanish name for these violets , and it means  little roostr 
linda set the violets as carefully as they had been lifted and rinsed her hands at the hydrnt 
now bring on the remainder of the exhibit , she ordered 
it s there on the top of the rock pile , which you notice has incrased since ye lastsaw it 
it has 
it has 
beautifully colored specimens those are too 
my fern bed will lift up its voice and rejoice in them 
rocks mean henry anderson 
the box i do not understnd 
linda picked it up , untied the sting , and slipped off the wrapping 
katy stred in widemouthed amazement 
i was justtickled over that because miss eileen saw a good looking and capable young man leave a second package , right on the heels of young whiting , she said 
whatever have ye got , lambie 
what does that mean 
linda held up a beautiful box of glass , inside of which could be seen swarming specimens of every bug , beetle , insect , and worm that henry anderson had been able to collect in heaven only knew what hours of search 
linda opened the box 
the winged creatures flew , the bettles tumbled , the worms went over the top 
she set it on the ground and laughed to exhauston 
her eyes were wet as she looked up at katy 
that firstnight henry anderson and peter morrison were here to dinner , katy , she said , anderson made a joke about being my bugcatcher when i built my home nest and several times since he has tried to be silly about it , but the lasttime i told him it was foolishness to which i would listn no more , so instad of talking , he has taken this way of telling me that he is fairly expert as a bugcatcher 
really , it is awfully funny , katy 
katy was sober 
she showed no appreciation of the fun 
ye know , lambie , she said , her hands on her hips , her elbows widespread , her jaws argumentative , i have done some blarneying with that lad , an  i have fed him some , because he was doin  things that would help an  please ye , but now i am tellin  ye , justlike i will be tellin  ye till i die , i ain t stong for him 
if ever the day comes when ye ask me to take on that whiting kid for me boss , i will bow my head an  i will fly at his bidding , because he is real , he is goin  to come out a man lots like your pa , or hisn 
an  if ever the day comes when ye will be telling me ye want me to serve pater morrison , i will well nigh get on my knees to him 
i think he would be the closestwe would ever come to gettin  the mastr back 
i couldn t say i would ever take to anderson 
they s something about him , i can t justsay what , but he puts me back up amazin  
do not worry , ancient custdian of the family , said linda 
that same something in henry anderson that antagonizes you , affects me in even stonger degree 
you mustnot get the foolish notion that any man has a speculative eye on me , because it is not true 
donald whiting is only a boy friend , treating me as a brother would , and peter morrison is much too sophistcated and mature to pay any serious attention to a girl with a year more high school before her 
i want to be decent to henry anderson , because he is peter s architect , and i am deeply interestd in peter s house and the lady who will live in it 
metimes i hope it will be donald s sistr , mary louise 
anyway , i am going to get acquainted with her and make it my business to see that she and peter get their chance to know each other well 
my job for peter is to help run his brook at the proper angle , build his bridge , engineer his road , and plant his grounds 
do not be draming any foolish drams , katy 
katy folded her arms , tilted her chin at an unusually aspiring angle , and deliberately sniffed 
do not ye be lettin  yourself belave your own foolishness , she said 
i ain t done with me exhibit yet 
on the hall table ye will find a package from the pater morrison man that miss eileen had the joy of takin  in and layin  aside for ye , an atop of it rist a big letter that i am thinkin  might mean miss marian 
oh , cried linda 
why are you wastng all this time 
if there is a letter from marian it may mean that the competition is decided 
if it is , she loses , because she was to telegraph if she won 
linda rushed into the house and carried her belongings to her workroom 
she drpped them on the table and looked at them 
i will get you off my mind first she said to the morrison package , which enclosed a new article entitled how to grow good citizens 
with it was a scrawled line , i am leaving the head and heels of the future to you 
how fine 
exulted linda 
he musthave liked the head and tail pieces i drw for his other article , so he wants the same for this , and if he is well paid for his article , maybe in time , after i have settled for my hearth motto , he will pay me something for my work 
gallumshus 
as she opened the letter from marian she slowly shook her head 
drt the luck , she muttered , no good news here 
slowly and absorbedly she read  dearestlinda  no telegram to send 
i grazed the firstprize and missed the second because henry anderson wins with plans so like mine that they are practically duplicates 
i have not seen the winning plans 
mr snow told me as gently as he could that the judges had ruled me out entirely 
the winning plans are practically a reversal of mine , more professionally drwn , and no doubt the specifications are far  ead of mine , as these are my weak spot , although i have worked all day and far into the night on the mathematics of house building 
mr snow was very kind , and terribly cut up about it 
i made what i hope was a brave fight , i did so believe in those plans that i am afraid to say justhow greatly disappointed i am 
all i can do is to go to work again and try to find out how to better my best which i surely put into the plans i submitted 
i can t see how henry anderson came to hit upon some of my personal designs for comforts and conveniences 
i had hoped that no man would think of my especial kitchen plans 
i rather fancied myself as a benefactor to my sex , an emancipator from drdgery , as it were 
i had a concealed feeling that it required a woman who had expended her stength combating the constuction of a devilish kitchen , to devise some of my builtin conveniences , and i worked as carefully on my kitchen table , as on any part of the house 
if i find later that the winning plans include these things i shall believe that henry anderson is a mind reader , or that lostplans naturally gravitate to him 
there is no use to grouch further 
i seem to be born a loser 
anyway , i haven t lostyou and i stll have dana meade 
i have nothing else to tell you except that mr snow has waited for me two evenings out of the week ever since i wrote you , and he has taken me in his car and simply forced me to drve him for an hour over what appeals to me to be the mostdifficult roads he could select 
far i have not balked at anything but he has had the consideration not to direct me to the mountains 
he is extremely attractive , linda , and i do enjoy being with him , but i drad it too , because his grief is so deep and so apparent that it constntly keeps before me the loss of my own dear ones , and those things to which the hymn books refer as aching voids in my own life 
there is something you will be glad to hear 
that unknown correspondent of mine is stll sending letters , and i am crazy about them 
i do not answer one now until i have mulled over it two or three days and i try to give him as good as he sends 
i judge from your letters that you are keeping at leasteven with eileen , and that life is much happier for you 
you seem to be broadening 
i am so glad for the friendship you have formed with donald whiting 
my mother and mr 
whiting were friends 
she is a charming woman and it has seemed to me that in her daughter louise she has managed a happy compound of oldfashioned staightforwardness and unswerving principle , festoned with happy trimmings of all that is bestin the present days 
i hope that you do become acquainted with her 
she is older than you , but she is the kind of girl i know you would like 
do not worry because i have lostagain , linda dear 
today is my blue day 
tomorrow i shall roll up my sleeves and go at it again with all my might , and by and by it is written in the books that things will come right for me 
they cannot go wrong for ever 
with dearestlove , marian 
linda looked grim as she finished the letter 
confound such luck , she said emphatically 
i do not understnd it 
how can a man like henry anderson know more about comforts and conveniences in a home than a woman with marian s experience and comprehension 
she has been gaining experience for the pastten years 
that partner of his mustbe a sixcylinder miracle 
linda went to the kitchen , because she was in pressing need of someone to whom to tell her troubles , and there was no one except katy 
what katy said was energetic and emphatic , but it comforted linda , because she agreed with it and what she was seeking at the minute was someone who agreed with her 
as she went back upstirs , she met eileen on her way to the front door 
eileen paused and deliberately stdied linda s face , and linda stpped and waited quietly until she chose to speak 
i presume , said eileen at last that you and katy would call the process through which you are going right now ,  taking the bit in your teeth ,  or some poetic thing like that , but i can t see that you are getting much out of it 
i do not hear the old laugh or the clatter of gay feet as i did before all this war of dissatisfaction broke out 
this minute if you haven t either cried , or wanted to , i miss my guess 
you win , said linda 
i have not cried , because i make it a rule never to resort to tears when i can help it 
what you see now is unshed tears in my heart 
they in no way relate to what you so aptly term my  war of dissatisfaction  
they are for marian 
she has lostagain , this time the nicholson and snow prize in architecture 
serves her right , said eileen , laughing contemptuously 
the ridiculous idea of her trying to compete in a man s ageold occupation 
as if she ever could learn enough about joist and beams and girders and instlling water and gas and electricity to build a house 
she should have had the sense to know she couldn t do it 
the man who beat her is peter morrison s architect , henry anderson , and he won by such a narrow margin that her plans were thrown out of second and third place , because they were so very similar to his 
doesn t that stike you as curious 
that is more than curious , said eileen slowly 
that is a very stange coincidence 
they couldn t have had anything from each other , because they only met at dinner , before all of us , and marian went away the next morning 
it does seem queer 
she added with a flash of generosity and justce , it looks pretty good for marian , at that 
if she came so near winning that she lostsecond and third because she was too near firstto make any practical difference , i mustbe wrong and she mustbe right 
you are wrong , said linda tersely , if you think marian cannot make wonderful plans for houses 
going back to what my  war of dissatisfaction  is doing to me , it s a pale affair compared with what it is doing to you , eileen 
you look a debilitated silhouette of the near recent past  do you feel that badly about giving up a little money and authority 
i never professed to have the slightestauthority over you , said eileen very primly , as she drw back in the shadows 
you have come and gone exactly as you pleased 
all i ever tried to do was to keep up a decent appearance before the neighbors and make financial ends meet 
that never seemed to wear on you as something seems to do now , said linda 
i am thankful that this week ends it 
i was looking for you because i wanted to tell you to be sure not to make any date that will keep you from meeting me at the office of the president of the consolidated bank thursday afternoon 
i am going to arrange with john to be there and it shouldn t take fifteen minutes to run through matters and divide the income in a fair way between us 
i am willing for you to go on paying the bills and ordering for the house as you have been 
certainly you are , sneered eileen 
you are quite willing for all the work and use the greater part of my time to make you comfortable 
linda suddenly drw back 
her body seemed to recoil , but her head thrustforward as if to bring her eyes in better range to read eileen s face 
that is utterly unjust eileen , she cried 
two at a time she rushed the stirs in a race for her room 
linda strted to school half an hour earlier wednesday morning because that was the day for her weekly trip to the postoffice for any mail which might have come to her under the name of jane meredith 
she had hard work to keep down her color when she recognized the heavy gray envelope used by the editor of everybody s home 
as she turned from the window with it in her fingers she was trembling slightly and wondering whether she could have a minute s seclusion to face the answer which her lastletter might have brought 
there was a small alcove beside a public desk at one side of the room 
linda stpped into this , tore open the envelope and slipped out the sheet it contained 
dazedly she stred at the slip that fell from it 
slowly the color left her cheeks and then came rushing back from her surcharged heart until her very ears were red , because that slip was very manifesty a cheque for five hundrd dollars 
mentally and physically linda shook herself , then she staightened to full height , tensing her muscles and holding the sheet before her with a hand on each side to keep it from shaking , while she read  my dear madam  i sincerely apologize for having waited so long before writing you of the very exceptional reception which your articles have had 
i think one half their attraction has been the exquisite and appealing pictures you have sent for their illustation 
at the present minute they are forming what i consider the mostunique feature in the magazine 
i am enclosing you a cheque for five hundrd dollars as an initial payment on the series 
justwhat the completed series should be worth i am unable to say until you inform me how many months you can keep it up at the same grade of culinary and literary interestand attractive illustation 
i should say at a rough estmate that you would be safe in counting upon a repetition of this cheque for every three articles you send in 
this of course includes payment for the pictures also , which are to me if anything more attractive than the recipes , since the local color and environment they add to the recipe and the word sketch are valuable in the extreme 
if you feel that you can continue this to the extent of even a small volume , i shall be delighted to send you a book contract 
in considering this proposition , let me say that if you could not produce enough recipes to fill a book , you could piece it out to the necessary length mostcharmingly and attractively by lengthening the descriptions of the environment in which the particular fruits and vegetables you deal with are to be found 
in book form you might allow yourself much greater latitude in the instuctions concerning the handling of the fruits and the preparation of the recipes 
i think myself that a wonderfully attractive book could be made from this material , and hope that you will agree with me 
trustng that this will be satisfactory to you and that you will seriously consider the book proposition before you decline it , i remain , my dear madam , very truly yours , hugh thompson , editor , everybody s home 
gripping the cheque and the letter , linda lurched forward againstthe window casement and shut her eyes tight , because she could feel big , nervous gulps of exultation and rejoicing swelling up in her throat 
she shifted the papers to one hand and surreptitiously slipped the other to her pocket 
she tried to keep the papers before her and looked staight from the window to avoid attracting attention 
the tumult of exultation in her heart was so wild that she did not surely know whether she wanted to sink to the floor , lay her face againstthe glass , and indulge in what for generations women have referred to as a good cry , or whether she wanted to leap from the window and sport on the wind like a drven leaf 
she returned the letter and cheque to the envelope , and slipped it inside her blouse , and strted on her way to school 
she might as well have gone to multiflores canyon and pitted her stength againstclimbing its walls for the day , for all the good she did in her school work 
she heard no word of any recitation by her schoolmates 
she had no word ready when called on for a recitation herself 
she heard nothing that was said by any of the professors 
on winged feet she was flying back and forth from the desert to the mountains , from the canyons to the sea 
she was raiding beds of amass and devising ways to roastthe bulbs and make a new dish 
she was compounding drnks from mescal and bisnaga 
she was hunting desert pickles and trying to remember whether indian rhubarb ever grew so far south 
she was glad when the dismissal hour came that afternoon 
with eager feet she went staight to the consolidated bank and there she asked again to be admitted to the office of the president 
mr worthington rose as she came in 
am i wrong in my dates 
he inquired 
i was not expecting you until tomorrow 
no , you are quite right , said linda 
at this hour tomorrow 
mr worthington , i am in trouble again 
linda looked so distessed that the banker pushed a chair to the table s side for her , and when she had seated herself , he said quietly   tell me all about it , linda 
we mustget life staightened out as bestwe can 
i think i musttell you all about it , said linda , because i know justenough about banking to know that i have a proposition that i do not know how to handle 
are bankers like father confessors and doctors and lawyers 
i think they are even more so , laughed mr worthington 
perhaps the father confessor takes precedence , otherwise i believe people are quite as much interestd in their financial secrets as in anything else in all this world 
have you a financial secret 
yes , said linda , i have what is to me a big secret , and i do not in the leastknow how to handle it , so right away i thought about you and that you would be the one to tell me what i could do 
go  ead , said mr worthington kindly 
i will give you my word of honor to keep any secret you confide to me 
linda produced her letter 
she opened it and without any preliminaries handed it and the cheque to the banker 
he looked at the cheque speculatively , and then laid it aside and read the letter 
he gave every evidence of having read parts of it two or three times , then he examined the cheque again , and glanced at linda 
justhow did you come into possession of this , young lady 
he inquired 
what is it that you want of me 
why , do not you see 
it s my letter and my cheque 
i am  jane meredith 
now how am i going to get my money 
for one dazed moment mr worthington stdied linda 
he threw back his head and laughed unrestainedly 
he came around the table and took both linda s hands 
bully for you  
he cried exultantly 
how i wish your father could see the seed he has sown bearing its fruit 
isn t that fine 
do you want to go on with this anonymously 
i think i must said linda 
i have said in my heart that no jp , male or female , young or old , shall take firsthonors in a class from which i graduate 
you can see that if people generally knew this , it would make it awfully hard for me to go on with my stdies , and i do not know that the editor who is accepting this work would take it if he knew it were sent him by a highschool junior 
you see the dignified way in which he ad drsses me as  madam  
i see , said mr worthington reflectively 
i am sure , said linda with demure lips , though the eyes above them were blazing and dancing at high tension , i am sure that the editor is attaching a husband , and a house having a wellordered kitchen , and rather wide culinary experience to that  wouldear madam 
what about this book proposition 
asked the banker gravely 
that would be a big thing for a girl of your age 
can you do it , and continue your school work 
with the background i have , with the unused material i have , and with vacation coming before long , i can do it easily , said linda 
my school work is not difficult for me 
it only requires concentration for about two hours in the preparation that each day brings 
the remainder of the time i could give to amplifying and producing new recipes 
i see , said the banker 
you have resolved , linda , that you do not want your editor to know your real name 
could scarcely be done , said linda 
have you stpped to think , said the banker , that you will be asked for personal histry and about your residence , and no doubt a photograph of yourself 
if you continue this work anonymously you are going to have trouble with more matters than cashing a cheque 
i am not going to have any trouble cashing a cheque , she said , because i have come staight to the man whose business is cheques 
true enough , he said 
i shall have to arrange the cheque 
there s not a doubt about that 
as for your other bugbears  i refuse to be frightened by them , interposed linda 
have you ever done any business at the bank 
no , said linda 
none of the clerks know you 
not that i remember , said linda 
i might possibly be acquainted with some of them 
i have merely passed through the bank on my way to your room twice 
after this estte business is settled you will want to open an account in your name 
quite true , said linda 
i would advise you , said mr worthington , to open this account in your own name 
endorse this cheque  jane meredith  and make it payable to me personally 
whenever one of these comes , bring it to me and i will take care of it for you 
one minute 
he left linda sitting quietly reading and rereading her letter , and presently returned and laid a sheaf of paper money before her 
take it to the paying teller 
tell him that you wish to deposit it , and ask him to give you a bank book and a cheque book , he said 
thank you very much for coming to me and for confiding in me 
linda gathered up the money , and said goodbye to the banker 
justas she strted forward she recognized eileen at the window of the paying teller 
it was an eileen she never before had seen 
her face was stained to a ghasty gray 
her hat was not staight and her hands were shaking 
without realizing that she was doing it , linda stpped behind one of the huge marble pillars supporting the ceiling and stod there breathlessly , watching eileen 
she could gather that she was discussing the bank ledger which lay before the teller and that he was refusing something that eileen was imploring him to do 
linda thought she understod what it was 
very clearly eileen s voice , sharp and stained , reached her ears 
you mean that you are refusing to pay me my deposits on my private account 
she cried 
linda could also hear the response 
i am very sorry if it annoys or inconveniences you , miss stong , but since the settlement of the estte takes place to morrow , our orders are to pay out no funds in any way connected with the estte until after that settlement has been arranged 
this is my money , my own private affair , begged eileen 
the estte has nothing to do with it 
i am sorry , repeated the teller 
if that is the case , you will have no difficulty in estblishing the fact in a few minutes  time 
eileen turned and left the bank , and it seemed that she was almostswaying 
linda stod a second with narrowed eyes , in deep thought 
i think , she said at last deep down in her heart , that it looks precious much as if there had been a bit of transgression in this affair 
it looks , too , as if  the way of the transgressor  were a darned hard way 
staight  ead open and aboveboard for you , my girl 
she went quietly to the desk and transacted her own business 
her beautiful day was clouded 
her heart was no longer leaping exultantly 
she was sickened and sorrowful over the evident nerve stain and discomfort which eileen seemed to have brought upon herself 
she draded meeting her at dinner that night , and she wondered all the way home where eileen had gone from the bank and what she had been doing 
what she felt was a pale affair compared with what she would have felt if she could have seen eileen leave the bank and enter a nearby stre , go to a telephone booth and put in a longdistnce call for san francisco 
her eyes were brilliant , her cheeks by nature redder than the rouge she had used upon them 
she squared her shoulders , lifted her head , as if she irrevocably had made a decision and would not be thwarted in acting upon it 
while she waited she staightened her hat , and tucked up her pretty hair , once more evincing concern about her appearance 
after a nervous wait she secured her party 
am i speaking with mr james heitman 
she asked 
yes , came the answer 
well , uncle jim , this is eileen 
why , hello , girlie , was the quick response 
delighted that you are calling your ancient uncle 
haven t changed the decision in the lastletter i had from you , have you 
yes , said eileen , i have changed it 
do you and aunt caroline stll want me , uncle jim 
you bet we want you 
roared the voice over the  phone 
here we are , with plenty of money and not a relation on earth but you to leave it to 
you belong to us by rights 
we would be tickled to death to have you , and for you to have what s left of the money when we get through with it 
may i come after you 
say the word , and i will strt this minute 
oh , uncle jim , could you 
would you 
cried eileen 
well , i would say i could 
we would be tickled to death , i tell you 
how long would it take you to get here 
well , i could reach you by noon tomorrow 
eleven something is the shortesttime it s been made in 
that would give me thirteen more than enough 
are you in that much of a hurry 
yes , gasped eileen , yes , i am in the biggestkind of a hurry there is , uncle jim 
this troublesome little estte has to be settled tomorrow afternoon 
there s going to be complaint about everything that i have seen fit to do 
i have been hounded and harassed till i am disgustd with it 
i have promised to marry john gilman as i wrote you , and i do not believe you would think that was my bestchance with the opportunities you could give me 
it seems foolish to sty here , abused as i have been lately , and as i will be tomorrow 
you have the house number 
if you come and get me out of it by noon tomorrow , i will go with you 
you may take out those adoption papers you have always entreated me to agree to and i will be a daughter that you can be proud of 
it will be a relief to have some real money and some real position , and to breathe freely and be myself once more 
all right for you , girlie 
bellowed the great voice over the line 
pick up any little personal bits you can put in a suitcase , and by twelve o clock tomorrow i will whisk you right out of that damn mess 
eileen walked from the telephone booth with her head high , triumph written all over her face and figure 
they were going to humiliate her 
she would show them 
she went home immediately 
entering her room , she closed the door and stod looking at her possessions 
how could she get her trunk from the garret 
how could she get it to the sttion 
would it be possible for uncle james to take it in his car 
as she pondered these things eileen had a dim memory of a day in her childhood when her mother had gone on business to san francisco and had taken her along 
she remembered a huge house , all turrets and towers and gables , all turns and twist and angles , closed to the light of day and glowing inside with shining artificial lights 
she remembered stmbling over deep rugs 
one vivid impression was of walls covered with huge canvases , some of them having frames more than a foot wide 
she remembered knights in armor , and big fireplaces , and huge urns and vases 
it seemed to her like the mostwonderful bazaar she ever had been in 
she remembered , too , that she had been glad when her mother had taken her out into the sunshine again and from the presence of two ponderous people who had objected stongly to everything her mother had discussed with them 
she paused one instnt , contemplating this picture 
the look of triumph on her face toned down considerably 
she comforted herself aloud 
i have heard mother say , she said softly , that everybody overdid things and did not know how to be graceful with immense fortunes got from silver and gold mines , and lumber 
it will be different now 
probably they do not live in the same house , even 
there is a small army of servants , and there is nothing i can think of that uncle jim won t gladly get me 
i have been too big a fool for words to live this way as long as i have 
crush me , will they 
i will show them 
i won t even touch these things i have stained so to get 
eileen jerked from her throat the stand of pearls that she had worn continuously for four years and threw it contemptuously on her drssing table 
i will make uncle jim get me a rope with two or three stands in it that will reach to my waist   a suitcase  
i do not know what i would fill a suitcase with from here 
the trunk may sty in the garret , and while i am leaving all this rubbish , i will justleave john gilman with it 
uncle jim will give me an income that will buy all the cigarettes i want without having to deceive anyone 
i can have money if i want to stke something at bridge without being scared into paralysis for fear somebody may find it out or the accounts won t balance 
i will put on the mostsuitable thing i have to travel in , and justwalk out and leave everything else 
that was what eileen did 
at noon the next day her eyes were bright with nervousness 
her cheeks alternately paled with fear and flooded red with anxiety 
she had drssed herself carefully , laid out her hat and gloves and a heavy coat in case the night should be chilly 
once she stod looking at the dainty , brightly colored drsses hanging in her wardrbe a flash of regret passed over her face 
tawdr little cheap things and makeshifts , she said 
if linda feels that she has been so terribly defrauded , she can help herself now 
by twelve o clock she found herself stnding at the window , staining her eyes down lilac valley 
she was not looking at its helpful hills , at its appealing curves , at its brilliant colors 
she was watching the roadway 
when katy rang to call her to lunch , she told her to put the things away 
she was expecting people who would take her out to lunch presently 
in the pastyears she had occasionally written to her uncle 
several times when he had had business in los angeles she had met him at his hotel and dined with him 
she reasoned that he would come staight to the house and get her , and then they would go to one of the big hotels for lunch before they strted 
i shan t feel like myself , said eileen , until we are well on the way to san francisco 
at one o clock she was walking the floor 
at two she was almostfrantic 
at half pastshe almostwished that she had had the good sense to have some lunch , since she was very hungry and under tense nerve stain 
once she paused before the glass , but what she saw frightened her 
justwhen she felt that she could not endure the stain another minute , grinding brakes , the blastof a huge klaxon , and the sound of a great voice arose from the steet 
eileen rushed to the window 
she took one look , caught up the suitcase and raced down the stirs 
at the door she met a bluff , big man , gross from head to foot 
it seemed to eileen stange that she could see in him even a trace of her mother , and yet she could 
red veins crossed his cheeks and glowed on his nose 
his tired eyes were watery 
his thick lips had an inclination to sag 
there was heartiness in his voice and earnestess in the manner in which he picked her up 
what have they been doing to you down here 
he demanded 
never should have left you this long 
ought to have come down and taken you and showed you what you wanted , and then you would have known whether you wanted it or not 
at this juncture a huge woman , gross in a feminine way as her husband was in his , paddled up the walk 
i am comin  in and resta few minutes , she said 
i am tired to death and i am pounded to pieces 
her husband turned toward her 
he opened his lips to introduce eileen 
his wife forestlled him 
this is the eileen you have been ravin  about for years , she said 
i thought you said she was a pretty girl 
eileen s soul knew one sick instnt of recoil 
she looked from james heitman to caroline , his wife , and remembered that he had a habit of calling her callie 
all that paint and powder and lipstck and brilliantine could do to make the ponderous , big woman more ghasty had been done , but in the rush of the long ride through which her husband had forced her , the colors had mixed and slipped , the false waves were displaced 
she was not in any condition to criticize the appearance of another woman 
for one second eileen hesitated , then she lifted her shaking hands to her hat 
i have been hounded out of my senses , she said apologetically , and have been so terribly anxious for fear you wouldn t get here on time 
please , aunt caroline , let us go to a hotel , some place where we can staighten up comfortably 
well , what s your hurry 
you are not a fugitive from justce , are you 
can t a body resta few minutes and have a drnk , even 
besides , i am going to see what kind of a place you have been living in , and then i will know how thankful you will be for what we got to offer 
eileen turned and threw open the door 
the big woman walked in 
she looked down the hall , up the stirway , and went on to the living room 
she gave it one contemptuous glance , and turning , came back to the door 
all right , jim , she said brusquely 
i have seen enough 
if you know the besthotel in the town , take me there 
then , if eileen s in such a hurry , after we have had a bite we will strt for home 
thank you , aunt caroline , oh , thank you 
cried eileen 
you needn t take the trouble to  aunt  me every time you speak to me , said the lady 
i know you are my niece , but i ain t goin  to remind you of it every time i speak to you 
it s agein  , this  auntie  business 
i do not stnd for it , and as for a name , i am free to confess i always like the way jim calls me  callie 
that sounds younger and more companionable than  caroline 
james heitman looked at eileen and winked 
you justbet , old girl 
he said 
they ain t any of them can beat you , not even eileen at her best  let s get her out of here 
does this represent your luggage , girlie 
you said not to bother with anything else , said eileen 
i did , said uncle jim , and i meant justwhat i said if it s all right with you 
i suppose i did have , in the back of my head , an idea that there might be a trunk or a boxsome things that belonged to your mother , mebby , and your  keepsakes 
oh , never mind , interrupted eileen 
do let s go 
it s nearly four o clock 
any minute they may send for me from the bank , and i would be more than glad to be out of the way 
well , i am not accustmed to being the porter , but if time s that precious , here we go , said uncle jim 
he picked up the suitcase with one hand and took his wife s arm with the other 
scoot down there and climb into that boat , he said proudly to eileen 
we will have a good dinner in a private room when we get to the hotel 
i won t even registr 
then we will get out of here when we have restd a little 
can t we sty all night and go in the morning 
panted his wife 
no , ma am , we can t , said james heitman authoritatively 
we will eat a bite because we need to be fed up , and i sincerely hope they s some decent grub to be had in this burg 
the firstplace we come to outside of here , that looks like they had a decent bed , we will stp and make up for lastnight 
we ain t agoin  to sty here if eileen wants us to strt right away , eh , eileen 
yes , please 
panted eileen 
i justdo not want to meet any of them 
it s time enough for them to know what has happened after i am gone 
all right then , said uncle james 
pile in and we will go 
eileen strted on the road to the unlimited wealth her soul had always craved 
at the bank linda and john gilman waited an hour pastthe time set for eileen s appearance 
linda asserted herself 
i have had a feeling for some time , she said quietly , that eileen would not appear today , and if she doesn t see fit to come , there is no particular reason why she should 
there is nothing to do but go over the revenue from the estte 
the books will show what eileen has drwn monthly for her expense budget 
that can be set aside and the remainder divided equally between us 
it s very simple 
here is a letter i wrote to the publishers of father s books asking about royalties 
i haven t even opened it 
i will turn it in with the remainder of the business 
they were in the office with the president of the bank 
he rang for the clerk he wanted and the books he required , and an hour s rapid figuring settled the entire matter , with the exception of the private account , amounting to several thousands , stnding in eileen s name 
none of them knew any source of separate income she might have 
at a suggeston from linda , the paying teller was called in and asked if he could account for any of the funds that had gone into the private account 
not definitely , he said , but the amounts always corresponded exactly with the royalties from the books 
i stongly suspect that they consttute this private account of miss eileen s 
he did not say that she had tried to drw it the day previous 
john gilman made the suggeston that they should let the matter restuntil eileen explained about it 
linda spoke very quietly , but with considerable finality in her tone 
no , she said , i know that eileen had no source of private income 
mother used to mention that she had some wealthy relatives in san francisco , but they did not approve of her marriage to what they called a  poor doctor ,  and she would never accept , or allow us to accept , anything from them 
they never came to see us and we never went to see them 
eileen knows no more about them than i do 
we will work upon the supposition that everything that is here belonged to father 
set aside to eileen s credit the usual amount for housekeeping expenses 
turn the private account in with the remainder 
strt two new bank books , one for eileen and one for me 
divide the surplus each month exactly in halves 
i believe this is the proper time for the bank to turn over to me a certain key , specified by my father as having been left in your possession to be delivered to me on my coming of age 
with the key in her possession , linda and john gilman left the bank 
as they stod for a moment in front of the building , gilman removed his hat and ran his hands through his hair as if it were irritating his head 
linda , he said in a deeply wistul tone , i do not understnd this 
why shouldn t eileen have come today as she agreed 
what is there about this that is not according to law and honor and the plain , simple rights of the case 
i do not know , said linda 
there is something we do not understnd about it 
i am going to ask you , john , as my guardian , closing up my affairs today , to go home with me to be present when i open the little hidden door i found at the back of a library shelf when i was disposing of daddy s technical books 
there was a slip of paper at the edge of it specifying that the key was in possession of the consolidated bank and was to be delivered to me , in the event of daddy s passing , on my coming of age 
i have the key , but i would like to have you with me , and eileen if she is in the house , when i open that door 
i do not know what is behind it , but there s a certain feeling that always has been stong in my heart and it never was so stong as it is at this minute 
they boarded the steet car and ran out to lilac valley 
when katy admitted them linda put her arm around her and kissed her 
she could see that the house was freshly swept and beautifully decorated with flowers , and her trained nostils could scent whiffs of delicious odors from food of which she was specially fond 
in all her world katy was the one person who was celebrating her birthday 
she seemed rather surprised when linda and gilman came in together 
where is eileen 
inquired linda 
she musthave made some new friends , said katy 
about four o clock , the biggestcar that ever roared down this steet rolled up , and the biggestman and woman that i ever see came puffin  and pantin  in 
miss eileen did not tell me where she was goin  or when she would be back , but i know it won t be the night , because she took her little drssin  case with her 
belike it s another of them trips to riverside or pasadena 
very likely , said linda quietly 
katy , can you spare a few minutes 
no , lambie , i jistcan t , said katy , because a young person that s the apple of me eye is havin  a birthday the day and i have got me custrd cake in the oven and the custrd is in the makin  , and after miss eileen went and i did not see no chance for nothin  special , i jisthappened to look out , one of the ways ye do things unbeknownstto yourself , and there stod mr pater morrison moonin  over the  graveyard ,  like he called it , and it was lookin  like seein  graves he was , and i jisttook the bull by the horns , and i sings out to him and i says    mr pater morrison , it s a good friend ye were to the young missus when ye engineered her skylight and her beautiful fireplace , and this bein  her birthday , i am takin  the liberty to ask ye to come to dinner and help me celebrate 
he said he would run up to the garage and get into his raygimentals , whatever them might be , and he would be here at six o clock 
ye got a guestfor dinner , and if the custrd s scorched and the cake s flat , it s up to ye for kapin  me here to tell ye all this 
katy hurried to the kitchen 
linda looked at john gilman and smiled 
isn t that like her 
she said 
she led the way to the library , pulled aside the books , fitted the key to the little door , and opened it 
inside lay a single envelope , sealed and bearing her name 
she took the envelope , and walking to her father s chair beside his library table , sat down in it , and laying the envelope on the table , crossed her hands on top of it 
john , she said , ever since i have been big enough to think and reason and stdy things out for myself , there is a feeling i have hadi used to think it was unreasonable , then i thought it remote possibility 
this minute i think it s extremely probable 
before i open this envelope i am going to tell you what i believe it contains 
i have not the slightestevidence except personal conviction , but i believe that the paper inside this envelope is written by my father s hand and i believe it tells me that he was not eileen s father and that i am not her sistr 
if it does not say this , then there is nothing in race and blood and inherited tendencies 
linda picked up the paper cutter , ran it across the envelope , slipped out the sheet , and bracing herself she read  my darling linda  these lines are to tell you that your mother went to her eternal sleep when you were born 
four years later i met and fell in love with the only mother you ever have known 
at the time of our marriage we entered into a solemn compact that her little daughter by a former marriage and mine should be reared as sistrs 
i was to give half my earnings and to do for eileen exactly as i did for you 
she was to give half her love and her bestattention to your interest 
i sincerely hope that what i have done will not result in any discomfort or inconvenience to you 
with dearestlove , as ever your father , alexander stong 
linda laid the sheet on the table and drpped her hands on top of it 
she looked at john gilman 
john , she said , i believe you had better face the fact that the big car and the big people that carried eileen away today were her mother s wealthy relatives from san francisco 
she musthave been in touch with them 
i think very likely she sent for them after i saw her in the bank yestrday afternoon , trying with all her might to make the paying teller turn over to her the funds of the private account 
john gilman sat very stll for a long time , then he raised tired , disappointed eyes to linda s face 
linda , he said , do you mean you think eileen was not staight about money matters 
john , said linda quietly , i think it is time for the truth about eileen between you and me 
if you want me to answer that queston candidly , i will answer it 
ùi want the truth , said john gilman gravely 
well , said linda , i never knew eileen to be honestabout anything in all her life unless the truth served her better than an evasion 
her hair was not honestcolor and it was not honestcurl 
her eyebrows were not so dark as she made them 
her cheeks and lips were not so red , her forehead and throat were not so white , her form was not so perfect 
her friends were selected because they could serve her 
as long as you were poor and stuggling , marian was welcome to you 
when you won a great case and became prosperous and fame came rapidly , eileen took you 
i believe what i told you a minute ago   i think she has gone for good 
i think she went because she had not been fair and she would not be forced to face the fact before you and me and the president of the consolidated today 
i think you will have to take your heart home tonight and i think that before the night is over you will realize what marian felt when she knew that in  addition to having been able to take you from her , eileen was not a woman who would make you happy 
i am glad , deeply g]ad , that there is not a drp of her blood in my veins , sorry as i am for you and much as i regret what has happened 
i won t ask you to sty tonight , because you mustgo through the same black waters marian breastd , and you will want to be alone 
later , if you think of any way i can serve you , i will be glad for old sake s sake 
you mustnot expect me ever to love you or respect your judgment as i did before the shadow fell 
linda rose , replaced the letter , turned the key in the lock , and quietly slipped out of the room 
when she opened her door and stpped into her room she paused in astnishment 
spread out upon the bed lay a drss of georgette with little touches of fur and broad ribbons of satin 
in color it was like the flame of seasoned beechwood 
across the foot of the bed hung petticoat , camisole , and hose , and beside the drss a pair of satin slippers exactly matching the hose , and they seemed the right size 
linda tiptoed to the side of the bed and delicately touched the drss , and then she saw a paper lying on the waistfront , and picking it up read  lambie , here s your birthday , from loving old katy 
the lines were terse and to the point 
linda laid them down , and picking up the drss she walked to the mirror , and holding it under her chin glanced down the length of its reflection 
what she saw almoststnned her 
oh , good lord 
she said 
i can t wear that 
that isn t me 
she tossed the drss on the bed and strted in a headlong rush to the kitchen 
as she came through the door , you blessed old darling 
she cried 
what am i going to say to make you know how i appreciate your lovely , lovely gift 
katy raised her head 
there was something that is supposed to be the prerogative of royalty in the lift of it 
her smile was complacent in the extreme 
do not ye be stndin  there wastn  no time talkie  , she said 
i have oodles of time , said linda , but i warn you , you won t know me if i put on that frock , katy 
yes , i will , too , said katy 
katy , said linda , sobering suddenly , would it make any great difference to you if i were the only one here for always , after this 
katy laughed contemptuously 
well , i would warrant to survive it , she said coolly 
that is exactly what i musttell you , katy , said linda soberly 
you know i have told you a number of times through these years that i did not believe eileen and i were sistrs , and i am telling you now that i know it 
she did not come to the bank today , and the settlement of father s affairs developed the fact that i was my father s child and eileen was her mother s 
i am thinking , katy , that the big car you saw and the opulent people in it were eileen s mother s wealthy relatives from san francisco 
my guess is , katy , that eileen has gone with them for good 
lock her door and do not touch her things until we know certainly what she wants done with them 
katy stod thinking intently , then she lifted her eyes to linda s 
lambie , she whispered softly , are we ixpicted to go into mourning over this 
a mischievous light leaped into linda s eyes 
well , if there are any such expectations abroad , katherine on wouldonovan , she said soberly , the saints preserve  em , for we can t fulfill  em , can we , katy 
not to be savin  our souls , answered katy heartily 
i am jistso glad and thankful that i do not know what to do , and it s such good news that i do not belave one word of it 
while you are talkie  , what about john gilman 
i think , said linda quietly , that tonight is going to teach him how marian felt in her blackesthours 
well , he needn t be coming to me for sympathy , said katy 
if miss eileen has gone to live with the folks that come after her the day , ye might be savin  a wee crap o  sympathy for her , lambie 
they was jistthe kind of people that you would risk your neck slidin  down a mountain to get out of their way 
that is too bad , said linda reflectively 
because eileen is sensitive and constnt contact with crass vulgarity certainly would wear on her nerves 
now you be goin  and gettin  into that drss , lambie , said katy 
katherine on wouldonovan , said linda , you are used to it 
come again to confession 
tell me truly where and how did you get that drss 
tain t no rule of polite society to be lookin  gift horses in the mouth , said katy proudly 
how i got it is me own affair , jistlike ye got any gifts ye was ever makin  me , is yours 
where i got it 
i went into the city on the stafe car and i went to the biggeststre in the city and i got in the elevator and i says to the naygur    let me off where real ladies buy readytowear drsses 
up comes a little woman , and her hair was jistas soft and curling round her ears , and brown and pretty was her eyes , and the pink that god made was in her cheeks , and in a voice like runnin  water she says    could i do anything for you 
i told her what i wanted 
she says    how old is the young lady , and what s her size , and what s her color 
darlin  , ain t that drss the answer to what i told her 
yes , said linda 
if an artisthad been selecting a drss for me he would probably have chosen that one 
old dear , it s not suitable for me 
it s not the kind of drss that i intended to wear for years and years yet 
do you think , if i put it on tonight , i will ever be able to go back to boots and breeches again , and hunt the canyons for plants to cook foryou know what 
katy stod in what is commonly designated as a brown stdy 
she looked linda over piercingly 
yes , ma am , she said conclusively 
it s my judgment that ye will 
i think ye will maybe wrap the braids of ye around your head tonight , and i think ye will put on that frock , and i think ye will show pater morrison how your pa s daughter can sit at the head of his table and entertain her friends 
i think ye will hang it in your closet and put on your boots and breeches and go back to your old multiflores and attind to your business , the same as before 
all right , katy , said linda , if you have that much faith in me i have that much faith in myself 
old dear , i can t tell you how i love having a pretty drss for tonight 
katy dear , the  woulday of jubilee  has come 
before you go to sleep i am coming to your room to tell you fine large secrets , that you won t believe for a minute , but i haven t the time to do it now 
linda raced to her room and began drssing 
she let down the mop of her hair waving below her waistand looked at it despairingly 
that drss never was made for braids down your back , she said , glancing toward the bed where it lay shimmering in a mass of lovely color 
i am of age today 
for stte occasions i should be a woman 
what shall i do with it 
then she recalled katy s voice saying   braids round your head 
of course , said linda , that would be the thing to do 
i certainly do not need anything to add to my height 
i am far too tall now 
she parted her hair in the middle , brushed it back , divided it in even halves , and instad of braiding it , she coiled it around her head , firstone side and then the other 
she slipped into the drss and stuggled with its many and intricate fastnings 
she went to the guestroom to stnd before the fulllength mirror there 
slowly she turned 
critically she examined herself 
it s a bit shorter than i would have ordered it , she said , but it reduces my height , it certainly gives wonderful freedom in walking , and it s not nearly so short as i see other girls wearing 
again she stdied herself critically 
need some kind of ornament for my hair , she muttered , but i haven t got it , and neither do i own beads , bracelet , or a ring 
my ears are stcking right out in the air 
i am almostoffensively uncovered 
she went down to show herself to a delighted katy 
when the doorbell rang linda turned toward the hall 
katy reached a detaining hand 
you will do nothing of the sort , she said 
i answered the bell for miss eileen 
answer the bell i shall for you 
down the hall went katy with the light of battle in her eyes and the air of a conqueror in the carriage of her head 
she was well trained 
neither eyelid quivered as she flung the door wide to peter morrison 
he stod there in dinner drss , more imposing than katy had thought he could be 
with quick , inner exultation she reached for two parcels he carried 
over them her delight was so overpowering that peter morrison musthave seen a hint of it 
with a flourish katy seated him , and carried the packages to linda 
she returned a second later for a big vase , and in this linda arranged a great sheaf of radiant roses 
as katy strted to carry them back to the room , linda said wait a second , and selecting one half opened , she slipped it out , shortened the stm and tucked it among the coils of hair where she would have set an ornament 
the other package was a big box that when opened showed its interior to be divided into compartments in each of which nested an exquisite flower made of spun sugar 
the petals , buds , and leaves were perfect 
there were wonderful roses with pale pink outer petals and deepercolored hearts 
there were pink mallows that seemed as if they musthave been cut from the bushes bordering santa monica road 
there were hollyhocks of white and gold , and simply perfect tulips 
linda never before had seen such a treasure candy box 
she cried out in delight , and hurried to show katy 
in her pleasure over the real flowers and the candy flowers linda forgot her drss , but when she saw peter morrison stnding tall and staight , in dinner drss , she stpped and looked the surprise and pleasure she felt 
she had grown accustmed to peter in khaki pottering around his building 
this peter she never before had seen 
he represented something of culture , something of pride , a conformity to a nice custm and something more 
linda was not a psychoanalyst she could not see a wonderful aura of exquisite color enveloping peter 
when peter saw the girl approaching him , transformed into a woman whose shining coronet was jewelled with his living red rose , when he saw the beauty of her lithe slenderness clothed in a soft , flaming color , something emanated from his inner consciousness that linda did see , and for an instnt it distrbed her as she went forward holding out her hands 
peter , she said gaily , do you know that this is my day of jubilee 
i am a woman today by law , peter 
hereafter i am to experience at leasta moderate degree of financial freedom , and that i shall enjoy 
the greatestthing in life is friends 
peter took both the hands extended to him and looked smilingly into her eyes 
you take my breath , he said 
i knew , the firstglimpse i ever had of you scrambling from the canyon floor , that this transformation could take place 
my good fortune is beyond words that i have been firstto see it 
permit me , fair lady 
peter bent and kissed both her hands 
he hesitated a second , then he turned the right hand and left one more kiss in its palm 
to have and to hold 
he said whimsically 
thank you , said linda , closing her fistover it and holding it up for inspection 
i will see that it doesn t escape 
this minute i thank you for the candy , which i know is delicious , and for my very firstsheaf of roses from any man 
see what i have done with one of them 
she turned fully around that he might catch the effect of the rose , and in getting that he also got the full effect of the costme , and the possibilities of the girl before him 
then she gave him a shock 
isn t it a lovely frock 
she said 
another birthday gift from the stong rock of ages 
i have been making a collection of rocks for my fern bed , and i have got another collection that is not visible to anyone save myself 
katy s a rock , and you are a rock , and donald is a rock , and marian s a rock , and i am restng securely on all of you 
i wish my father knew that in addition to marian and katy i have found two more such wonderful friends 
what about henry anderson 
inquired peter 
aren t you going to include him 
linda walked over to the chair in which she intended to seat herself 
peter , she said , i wish you hadn t asked me that 
peter s figure tensed suddenly 
look here , linda , he said strnly , has that rather bold youngstr made himself in any way offensive to you 
not in any way that i am not perfectly capable of handling myself , said linda 
she looked at peter confidently 
do you suppose , she said , that i can sit down in this thing without ruining it 
shouldn t i really stnd up while i am wearing it 
peter laughed unrestainedly 
linda , you are simply delicious , he said 
it seems to me that i have seen young ladies in like case reach round and gather the sash to one side and smooth out the skirt as they sit 
thank you , peter , of course that would be the way , said linda 
this being my first i am lacking in experience 
thereupon she sat according to direction 
while peter sat opposite her 
now finish 
justone word more about henry anderson , he said 
are you perfectly sure there is nothing i need do for you in that connection 
oh , perfectly , said linda lightly 
i did not mean to alarm you 
he merely carried that bugcatcher nonsense a trifle too far 
i wouldn t have minded humoring him and fooling about it a little 
peter , do you know him quite well 
are you very sure of him 
no , said peter , i do not know him well at all 
the only thing i am sure about him is that he is doing well in his profession 
i chose him because he was an ambitious youngstr and i thought i could get more careful attention from him than i could from some of the older fellows who had made their reputation 
you see , there are such a lot of things i want to know about in this building proposition , and the lastfour years haven t been a time for any man to be careful about saving his money 
he mustbe 
i think i am like a cat 
i am very complacent with certain people , but when i begin to get goose flesh and hair prickles my head a bit , i realize that there is something antagonistc around , something for me to beware of 
i guess it s because i am such a wild creature 
do you mean to say , said peter , that these are the sensations that henry gives you 
linda nodded 
now forget henry , she said 
i have had such a big day i musttell you about it , and then we will come to that lastarticle you left me 
i haven t had time to put anything on paper concerning it yet , but i believe i have an awfully good idea in the paint pot , and i will find time in a day or two to work it out 
peter , i have justcome from the bank , where i was recognized as of legal age , and my guardian discharged 
perhaps i ought to explain to you , peter , that your friend , john gilman , is not here because this night is going to be a bad one for him 
when you knew him besthe was engaged , or should have been , to marian thorne 
when you met him this time he really was engaged to eileen 
i do not know what you think about eileen 
i do not feel like influencing anyone s thought concerning her , so i will merely say that today has confirmed a conviction that always has been in my heart 
katy could tell you that long ago i said to her that i did not believe eileen was my sistr 
today has brought me the knowledge and proof positive that she is not , and today she has gone to some wealthy relatives of her mother in san francisco 
she expressed her contempt for what she was giving up by leaving everything , including the exquisite little necklace of pearls which has been a daily part of her since she owned them 
i may be mistken , but intuition tells me that with the pearls and the wardrbe she has also discarded john gilman 
i think your friend will be suffering tonight quite as deeply as my friend suffered  when john abandoned her at a time when she had losteverything else in life but her money 
i feel very sure that we won t see eileen any more 
i hope she will have every lovely thing in life 
amen , said peter morrison earnesty 
i loved john gilman when we were in school together , but i have not been able to feel , since i located here , that he is exactly the same john 
what you have told me very probably explains the difference in him 
when katy announced dinner linda arose 
peter morrison stpped beside her and offered his arm 
linda restd her finger tips upon it and he led her to the head of the table and seated her 
katy served a meal that , if it had been prepared for eileen , she would have described as a banquet 
she gave them delicious , finely flavored food , stmulating , exquisitely compounded drnks that she had concocted from the rich fruits of california and mints and essences at her command 
when , at the close of the meal , she brought morrison some of the cigars eileen kept for john gilman , she set a second tray before linda , and this tray contained two packages 
linda looked at katy inquiringly , and katy , her face beaming , nodded her sandy red head emphatically 
more birthday gifts you have havin  , me lady , she said in her mellowestirish voice 
more 
marveled linda 
she picked up the larger package , and opening it , found a beautiful book inscribed from her friend donald , over which she passed caressing fingers 
why , how lovely of him 
she said 
how in this world did he know 
katherine on wouldonovan could have answered that queston , but she did not 
the other package was from marian 
when she opened it linda laughed unrestainedly 
what a joke 
she said 
i had promised myself that i would not touch a thing in eileen s room , and before i could do justce to katy s lovely drss i had to go there for pins for my hair and powder for my nose 
this is marian s way of telling me that i am almosta woman 
will you look at this 
well , justwhat is it 
inquired peter 
hairpins , laughed linda , and hair ornaments , and a box of face powder , and the little , feminine touches that my drssing table needs badly 
how would you like , peter , to finish your cigar in my workroom 
i would like it immensely , said peter 
together they climbed to the top of the house 
linda knelt and made a little ceremony of lighting the firstfire in her fireplace 
she pushed one of her chairs to one side for peter , and taking the other for herself , she sat down and began the process of really becoming acquainted with him 
two hours later , as he was leaving her , peter made a circuit of the room , scrutinizing the sketches and paintings that were rapidly covering the walls , and presently he came to the wasp 
he looked at it so closely that he did not miss even the stnger 
linda stod beside him when he made his firstdazed comment   if that isn t eileen , and true to the life 
i musttake that down , said linda 
i did it one night when my heart was full of bitterness 
better leave it , said peter drly 
do you think i need it as a warning 
asked linda 
peter turned and surveyed her slowly 
linda , he said quietly , what i think of you has not yet been written in any of the books 
as soon as peter had left her linda took her box of candy flowers and several of her finestroses and went to katy s room 
she found katy in a big rocking chair , her feet on a hassock , reading a stry in everybody s home 
when her door opened and she saw her young mistess framed in it she tossed the magazine aside and sprang to her feet , but linda made her resume her seat 
the girl shortened the stms of the roses and put them in a vase on katy s drsser 
they may clash with your coloring a mite , mother machree , she said , but by themselves they are very wonderful things , aren t they 
linda went over , and drwing her drss aside , sat down on the hassock and leaning againstkaty s knee she held up the box of candy flowers for amazed and delighted inspection 
 , the foine gintleman 
cried katy 
sure  twas only a pape i had when ye opened the box , an  i did not know how rare them beauties railly was 
choose the one you like best said linda 
katy would not touch the delicate things , so linda selected a brushy hollyhock for her and then sat at her knee again 
katherine on wouldonovan , she said solemnly , it s up to a couple of young things such as we are , standed on the shoals of the pacific as we have been , to put our heads together and take counsel 
you are a host katy , and while i am taking care of you , i will be justdelighted to have you go on looking after your black sheep 
it s going to be lonely , for all that 
after eileen has taken her personal possessions , what do you say to fixing up that room with the belongings that marian kept , and inviting her to make that suite her home until such time as she may have a home of her own again 
foine 
cried katy 
i would love to be havin  her 
i would agree to take orders from miss marian and to be takin  care of her jistalmostthe same as i do of ye , miss linda 
the one thing i do not like about it is that it ain t fair nor right to give even marian the best  ye be takin  that suite yourself , lambie , and give miss marian your room all fixed up with her things , or , if ye want her nearer , give her the guestroom and make a guestroom of yours 
i am willing to follow either of the latter suggestons for myself , said linda 
it might be pleasant to be across the hall from marian where we could call back and forth to each other 
i wouldn t mind a change as soon as i have time to get what i would need to make the change 
i will take the guestroom for mine , and you may call in a decorator and have my room freshly done and the guestthings moved into it 
katy looked belligerent 
linda reached up and touched the frowning lines on her forehead 
brighten your lovely features with a smile , katherine me dear , she said gaily 
do not be forgetting that this is our day of jubilee 
we are freei hope we are free foreverfrom petty annoyances and dissatisfactions and little , galling things that sear the soul and bring out all the worstin human nature 
i couldn t do anything to eileen s suite , not even if i resorted to tearing out partitions and making it new from strt to finish , that would eliminate eileen from it for me 
if marian will give me permission to move and instll her things in it , i think she can use it without any such feeling , but i couldn t 
it s agreed then , katy , i am to write to marian and extend to her a welcome on your part as well as on mine 
that ye may , lambie , said katy heartily 
as the boss used to be sabin  , justto make assurance doubly sure , if you would addrss it for me i would be writing  a bit of a line myself , conveying  to her me sentiments on the subject 
oh , fine , katy 
marian would be delighted 
cried linda , springing up 
katy dear , it won t make us feel any more like mourning for eileen when i tell you that it developed at the bank yestrday and today , that since she has been managing household affairs she has deposited in a separate account all the royalties from father s books 
i had thought the matter closed at the bank when this fund was added to the remainder of the estte , the household expenses set aside to eileen , and the remainder divided equally between us 
i did not get the proof that she was not my sistr until after i came home 
i think it means that i shall have to go back to the bank , have the matter reopened , and unless she can produce a will or something proving that she is entitled to it , it seems to me that what remains of my father s estte is legally mine 
of course , if it develops that he has made any special provision for her , she shall have it 
otherwise , katy , we will be in a position to instll you as housekeeper and put some lightfooted , capable young person under you for a stpsaver in any direction you want to use her 
it means , too , that i shall be able to repay your loan immediately and to do the things that i wanted to do about the house 
now i ain t in any hurry about that money , lambie , said katy 
you understnd of course that the drss you are wearing  i am given  ye 
of course , old dear , and you should have seen peter morrison light up and admire it 
he thinks you have wonderful tast , katy 
katy threw up both her hands 
oh , my lord , lambie 
she cried , aghast  was you telling  him that the drss ye were wearing  was a present from your old cook 
why , certainly i was , said linda , wide eyed with astnish meet 
why shouldn t i 
i was proud to 
now , old dear , before i go , the biggestsecret of all 
i had a letter , katy , from the editor of everybody s home , and people like our articles , katy 
they are something now and folk are letting the editor know about it , and he wants all i can send him 
he likes the pictures i make 
katy , you won t believe it till i show you my little bank book , but for the three already published with their illustations he pays me five hundrd nice , long , smooth , beautifully decorated , paper dollars 
judas prast 
cried katy , her hands once more aloft 
ye ain t manin  it , lambie 
yes , i are , laughed linda 
i have got the money 
for each succeeding three with their pictures i am to have that much more , and when i finish now stady yourself , katy , because this is going to be a shockwhen i finish , blessed old dear heart , he is going to make them into a book 
that will be my job for this summer , and you shall help me , and it will be a part of our great secret 
won t it be the mostfun 
my soul 
you are jistcrazy 
i do not belave a word you are telling  me 
i can prove it , because i have the letter and the bank book , said linda 
katy threw her arms around the girl and kissed the top of her head and cried over her and laughed at the same time and patted her and petted her and ended by saying   oh , lambie , if only the mastr could be knowin  it 
he does know , katy , said linda 
she went to her room , removed the beautiful drss and , arranging it on a hanger , left it in her closet 
slipping into an old drssing gown , she ran to her workroom and wrote a letter to marian from herself 
she tried not to tell marian the big , vital thing that was throbbing in her heart all day concerning her work , the great secret that meant such a wonderful thing to her , the thing that was beating in her heart and fluttering behind her lips like a bird trying to escape its cage 
she could tell her in detail of eileen s undoubted removal to san francisco 
she could tell her enough of the financial transactions of the day to make her understnd what had been happening in the past and she could tell of her latestinterview with john gilman 
once , as she sat with her pen poised , thinking how to phrase a sentence , linda said to herself   i wonder in my heart if he won t try to come crawfishing back to marian now , and if he does , i wonder , oh , how i wonder , what she will do 
linda shut her lips very tight and stred up through her skylight to the strs , as she was fastfalling into a habit of doing when she wanted inspiration 
well , i know one thing , she said to the shining things above her , marian will do as she sees fit , of course , but if it were i , and any man had discarded me as john gilman discarded marian , in case he ever wanted to pick me up again he would find i was not there 
much as i plan in my heart for the home and the man and the little people that i hope to have some day , i would give up all of them before i would be discarded and resought like that 
knowing marian as i do , i have a conviction that she will feel the same way 
from the things she is writing about this snow man i think it is highly probable that he may awake some day to learn that he is not so deeply grieved but that he would like to have marian to comfort him in his loneliness 
as for his little girl i do not see where he could find a woman who would rear her more judiciously and beautifully than marian would 
she finished her letter , sealed and stmped it , and then , taking out a fresh sheet , she lettered in at the top of it , indian potatoes and continued  and very good potatoes they are 
you will find these growing everywhere throughout california , blooming from may to july , their six long , slender , white petals shading to gold at the base , grayish on the outside , a pollenladen pistl upstnding , eight or ten goldclubbed stmens surrounding it , the slender brown stm bearing a dozen or more of these delicate blooms , springing high from a base of leaves sometimes nearly two feet long and an inch broad , wave margined , spreading in a circle around it 
in the soil of the plains and the dr hillsides you will find an amazingly large solid bulb , thickly enwrapped in a coat of brown fiber , the long threads of which can be braided , their amazing stength making them suitable for bow stings , lariats , or rope of any kind that mustneeds be improvised for use at the moment 
the bulbs themselves have many uses 
crushed and rubbed up in water they make a delightful cleansing lather 
the extracted juice , when cooked down , may be used as glue 
of the roastd bulbs effective poultices for bruises and boils may be made 
it was an indian custm to dam a small steam and throw in mashed amole bulbs , the effect of which was to stpefy the fish so that they could be picked out by hand 
all of which does not make it appear that the same bulb would serve as an excellent substtute for a baked potato 
we mustremember how our grandmothers made strch from our potatoes , used them to break in the new ironware , and to purify the lard 
which goes to prove that one vegetable may be valuable for many purposes 
amole , whose ponderous scientific name is chlorogalum pomeridiarum , is at its bestfor my purposes when all the chlorophyll from flower and stm has been drven back to the bulb , and it lies ripe and fully matured from late augustuntil december 
remove the fibrous cover down to the second or third layer enclosing the bulb 
these jackets are necessary as they keep the bulbs from dring out and having a hard crust  roastthem exactly as you would potatoes 
when they can easily be pierced with a silver fork remove from the oven , and serve immediately with any course with which you would use baked potatoes 
gee , but they are good 
commented linda as she reread what she had written 
after that she turned her attention to drwing a hillside whitened here and there with amole bloom showing in its purity againstthe warm grayishtan background 
the waving green leaves ran among big rocks and overlapped surrounding growth 
at the right of her drwing linda sketched in a fine specimen of monkey flower , deepening the yellow from the hearts of the amole lilies for the almosthuman little monkey faces 
on the left one giant specimen of amole , reared from a base of exquisitely waving leaves , ran up the side of the drwing and broke into an airy and graceful head of goldhearted white lilies 
for a long time linda sat with poised pencil , stdying her foreground 
what should she introduce that would be mosttypical of the location and gave her the desired splash of contrastng color that she used as a distnctive touch in the foreground of all her drwings 
her pencil flew busily a few minutes while she sketched in a flatly growing bush of prickly phlox , setting the flower faces as closely as the overlapped scales of a fish , setting them even as they grow in nature 
when she resorted to the color box she painted these faces a wonderful pink that was not wild rose , not cerise , not lilac , but it made one think of all of them 
when she could make no further improvement on this sketch , she carefully stetched it againstthe wall and tacked it up to dr 
afterward she cleared her mental decks of all the work she could think of in order to have saturday free , because saturday was the day upon which she found herself planning in the back of her mind throughout the stenuous week , to save for riding the king s highway with donald whiting 
several times she had met him on the walks or in the hallways , and always he had stpped to speak with her and several times he had referred to the high hope in which he waited for saturday 
linda already had held a consultation with katy on the subject of the lunch basket 
that matter being satisfactorily arranged , there was nothing for her to do but to double on her work so that saturday would be free 
friday evening linda was called from the dinner table to the telephone 
she immediately recognized the voice inquiring for her as that of judge whiting , and then she listned breathlessly while he said to her   you will recognize that there is very little i may say over a telephone concerning a matter to which you brought my attention 
i have a very competent man looking into the matter thoroughly , and i find that your fear is amply justfied 
wherever you go or whatever you do , use particular care 
do not have anything to do with any stanger 
justuse what your judgment and common sense tell you is a reasonable degree of caution in every direction no matter how trivial 
you understnd 
i do , said linda promptly 
would you prefer that we do not go on any more saturday trips at present 
the length of time that the judge waited to answer proved that he had taken time to think 
i can t see , he said finally , that you would not be safer on such a trip where you are moving about , where no one knows who you arc , than you would where you are commonly found 
all right then , said linda 
ask the party we are considering and he will tell you where he will be tomorrow 
thank you very much for letting me know 
if anything should occur , you will understnd that it was something quite out of my range of foresight 
i understnd , said the judge 
with all care and many loving admonitions katy assistd in the strt made early saturday morning 
the previous saturday linda had felt that all nature along the road she planned to drve would be at its best but they had not gone far until she modified her decision 
they were slipping through mist of early morning , over level , carefully made roads like pavilion floors 
if any one objection could have been made , it would have been that the mist of night were weighting too heavily to earth the perfume from the blooming orchards and millions of flowers in gardens and along the roadside 
at that hour there were few cars abroad 
linda was drssed in her outing suit of dark green 
she had removed her hat and slipped it on the seat beside her 
she looked at donald , a whimsical expression on her mostexpressive young face 
please to  scuse me , she said lightly , if i stp on the gas a mite while we have the road so much to ourselves and are so familiar with it 
later , when we reach stanger country and have to share with others , we will be forced to go slower 
do not stnt your speed on account of me , said donald 
i am justitching to know what kitty can do 
all right , here s your chance , said linda 
hear her purr 
she settled her body a trifle tensely , squared her shoulders , and gripped the stering wheel 
she increased the gas and let the bear cat roll over the smooth road from lilac valley running south into los angeles 
at a speed that was near to flying as a nonprofessional attains , the youngstrs traveled that road 
their eyes were shining 
their blood was racing 
until the point where rougher roads and approaching traffic forced them to go slower , they raced , and when they slowed down they looked at each other and laughed in morning delight 
i may not be very wise , said linda , but did not i do the smartestthing when i let eileen have the touring car and saved the bear cat for us 
nothing short of inspiration , said donald 
the height of my ambition is to own a bear cat 
if father makes any mention of anything i would like particularly to have for a graduation present , i am cocked and primed as to what i shall tell him 
you would better save yourself a disappointment , said linda soberly 
you will be strting to college this fall , and when you do you will be gone nine months out of the year , and i am fairly sure your father wouldn t think shipping a bear cat back and forth a good investent , or furnishing you one to take to school with you 
he would fear you would never make a grade that would be a credit to him if he did 
my 
laughed donald , you have got a long head on your shoulders 
when you are thrown on your own for four of the longest lonesomestyears of your life , you learn to think , said linda soberly 
she was touching the beginning of los angeles traffic 
later she was on the open road again 
the mist were thinning and lifting 
the perfume was not so heavy 
the sheeted whiteness of the orange groves was broken with the paler white of plum merging imperceptibly into the delicate pink of apricot and the stonger pink of peach , and there were deep green orchards of smooth waxen olive foliage and the lacyleaved walnuts 
came the citrus orchards again , and all the way on either hand running with them were almostuninterrupted miles of roses of every color and kind , and everywhere homes ranging from friendly mansions , all written over in adorable flower color with the happy invitation , come in and make yourself at home , to tiny bungalows along the wayside crying welcome to this gay pair of youngstrs in greetings fashioned from white and purple wistria , gold bignonia , every rose the world knows , and myriad brilliant annual and perennial flower faces gathered from the circumference of the tropical globe and homing enthusiastcally on the king s highway 
metimes linda lifted her hand from the wheel to wave a passing salute to a particularly appealing flower picture 
metimes she whisted a note or cried a greeting to a mockingbird , a rosy finch , or a song sparrow 
look at the pie timber 
she cried to donald , calling his attention to a lawn almostcovered with redwinged blackbirds 
four hundrd and twenty might be baked in that pie , she laughed 
a subtle change began to creep over the world 
the sun peered over the mountains inquiringly , a timid young thing , as if she were asking what degree of light and warmth they would like for the day 
a new brilliancy tinged every flower face in this light , a throbbing ecstsy mellowed every bird note 
the orchards drpped farther apart , meadows filled with grazing cattle flashed pastthem , the earthy scent of freshly turned fields mingled with flower perfume , and on their right came drfting in a cool salt breath from the sea 
at midforenoon , as they neared laguna , they ran pastgreat hills , untouched since the days when david cried   i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help 
at one particularly beautiful range , drped with the flowing emerald of spring , decorated with beds of gold poppy , set with flowering madrna and manzanita , with the gold of yellow monkey flower or the rich red of the related species , with specimens of lupin growing in small trees , here and there adventurous steams singing and flashing their unexpected way to the mother breastof the waiting ocean very near to the road which at one surprising turn carried them to the neverending wonder of the troubled sea , they drve as slowly as the bear cat would consent to travel , so that they might stdy great boulders , huge as many of the buildings they had passed , their faces scarred by the wrack of ages 
stdying their ancient records one could see that they had been familiar with the str that restd over bethlehem 
on their faces had shone the same moon that opened the highways journeying into damascus 
they had stod the strms that had beaten upon the world since the days when the floods subsided , the land lifted above the face of the waters in gigantic upheavals that had ripped the surface of the globe from north to south and forced up the hills , the foothills , and the mountains of the coastrange 
they had been born then , they had firstseen the light of day , in glowing , molten , redhot , highpiled steams of lava that had gushed forth in that awful evolution of birth 
metimes linda stpped the car , they left it , and climbed over the faces of these mighty upheavals 
once linda reached her hand to donald and cried , half laughingly , half in tense earnest  oh , kid , we have got to hurry 
compared with the age of these , we have only a few minutes 
it s all right to talk jestngly about  the crack of doom  but you know there really was a crack of doom , and right here is where it cracked and spewed out the material that hardened into these very rocks 
beside them i feel as a shrimp mustfeel beside a whale , and i feel that we musthurry 
so we must said donald 
i am hungry as likeliestwhen he waited for them to find enough peacock tongues to satisfy his appetite 
i wonder what brand of homebrew made him think of that , said linda 
well , you know , said donald , the world was only a smallish place then 
they did not have to go far to find everything to which they had access , and it musthave been rather a decent time in which to live 
awful lot of light and color and music and unique entertainment 
you are talking , said linda , from the stndpoint of the king or the mastr 
suppose you had lived then and had been the slave 
there you go again , said donald , throwing a brick into the mostdelicate mechanism of my profound thought 
you ought to be ashamed to round me up with something scientific and materialistc every time i go aglimmering 
do not you think this would be a fine place to have lunch 
you wait and see where we lunch today , and you will have the answer to that , said linda , strting back to the bear cat 
a few miles farther on they followed the road around the frowning menace of an overhanging rock and sped out directly to the panorama of the sea 
the sun was shining on it , but , as always round the laguna shore , the rip tide was working itself into undue fury 
it came dashing up on the ancient rocks until one could easily understnd why a poet of long ago wrote of sea horses 
me of the waves did suggestmonstous white chargers racing madly to place their feet upon the solid rock 
through the village , up the step inclines , pastplacid lakes , pastwaving yellow mustrd beds , beside highways where the breastlate of mother earth gleamed emerald and ruby againstthe background of billions of tiny , shining diamonds of the iceplant , pastthe old ostich tree reproduced by etchers of note the world over , with grinding brakes , sliding down the breathless declivity leading to the shore , linda stpped at lastwhere the rock walls lifted sheer almostto the sky 
she led donald to a huge circle carpeted with cerise sand verbena , with pink and yellow iceplant bloom , with jewelled iceplant foliage , with the running blue of the lovely sea daisy , with the white and pink of the sea fig , where the walls were festoned with ferns , lichens , stdded all over with flaming our lord s candles , and stange , uncanny , grotesque flower forms , almosthuman in their writhing turns as they twistd around the rocks and slipped along clinging to the sheer walls 
justwhere the vegetation met the white , seawashed sand , linda spread the indian blanket , and donald brought the lunch box 
at their feet adventurous waves tore themselves to foam on the sharp rocks 
on their left they broke in booming spray , tearing and fretting the base of cliffs that had stod impregnable through aeons of such ceaseless attack and repulse 
i wonder , said donald , how it comes that i have lived all my life in california , and today it seems to me that mostof the worthwhile things i know about her i owe to you 
when i go to college this winter t 
he things i shall be telling the boys will be how i could gain a living , if i had to , on the desert , in death valley , from the walls of multiflores canyon 
how the waves go to smash on the rocks of laguna , not to mention cactus fish hooks , mescal stcks , and brigand beefstak 
it s no wonder the artist of all the world come here copying these pictures 
it s no wonder they build these bungalows and live here for years , unsatisfied with their efforts to reproduce the pictures of the mastr painter of them all 
i wonder , said linda , if anybody is very easily satisfied 
i wonder today if eileen is satisfied with being merely rich 
i wonder if we are satisfied to have this golden day together 
i wonder if the white swallows are satisfied with the sea 
i wonder if those rocks are satisfied and proud to stnd impregnable againstthe constnt torment of the tide 
i wonder , oh , lord , how i wonder , broke in donald , about katherine on wouldonovan s lunch box 
if you want a picture of per feet satisfaction , belinda beloved , lead me to it 
thank heaven you are mistken , she said 
they spared me the  be  
it s truly just linda 
well , i am not sparing you the  be  , said donald , busy with the fastnings of the lunch basket 
did you hear where i used it 
yes , child , and i like it heaps , said linda casually 
it s fine to have you like me 
awfully proud of myself 
you have two members of our family at your feet , said donald soberly as he handed her packages from the box 
my dad is beginning to discourse on you with such signs of intelligence that i am almostled to believe , from some of his wildestoutburst , that he has had some personal experience in some way 
why not 
asked linda lightly 
haven t i often told you that my father constntly went on fishing and hunting trips , that he was a great collector of botanical specimens , that he frequently took his friends with him 
you might ask your father if he does not recall me as having fried fish and made coffee and rendered him camp service when i was a slip of a thing in the dawn of my teens 
well , he did not justmention it , said donald , but i can  
easily see how it might have been 
after they had finished one of katy s inspired lunches , in which a large part of the inspiration had been mental on linda s part and executive on katy s , they climbed rock faces , skirted wavebeaten promontories , and stod peering from overhanging cliffs dipping down into the fathomless green sea , where the water boiled up in turbulent fury 
linda pointed out the rocks upon which she would sit , if she were a mermaid , to comb the seaweed from her hair 
she could hear the sea bells ringing in those menacing depths , but donald s ears were not so finely tuned 
at the top of one of the highestcliffs they climbed , there grew a clump of slender pale green bushes , towering high above their heads with exquisitely cut bluegreen leaves , lance shaped and slender 
donald looked at the fascinating growth appraisingly 
linda , he said , do you know that the slimness and the sheerness and the audacious foothold and the beauty of that thing remind me of you 
it is covered all over with the delicate frostloom you taught me to see upon fruit 
i find it everywhere but you have never told me what it is 
linda laughingly reached up and broke a spray of greenishyellow tubular flowers , curving out like clustred trumpets spilling melody from their fluted throats 
you will see it everywhere 
you will find these flowers every month of the year , she said , and i am particularly gladsome that this plant reminds you of me 
i love the bluishgreen  bloom  of its sheer foliage 
i love the music these flower trumpets make to me 
i love the way it has traveled , god knows how , all the way from the argentine and spread itself over our country wherever it is allowed footing 
i am glad that there is soothing in these dred leaves for those who require it 
i shall be delighted to set my seal on you with it 
there are two little spanish words that it suggest to the mexicanbuena mozabut you shall find out for yourself what they mean 
encountering his father that night at his library door , donald whiting said to him   may i come in , dad 
i have something i mustlook up before i sleep 
have you a spanish lexicon , or no doubt you have this in your head 
well , i have a halting vocabulary , said the judge 
what s your phrase 
linda put this flower on me today , said donald , and she said she was pleased because i said the tall , slender bush it grew on reminded me of her 
she gave me the spanish name , but i do not know the exact significance of the decoration i am wearing until i learn the meaning of the phrase 
try me on it , said the judge 
buena moza ,  quoted donald 
the judge threw back his head and laughed heartily 
n , he said , you should know that from the latin you are learning 
you should translate it instnctively 
i couldn t tell you exactly whether a spaniard would translate  buena   fine  or  good 
knowing their highfalutin  rendition of almosteverything else i would take my chance on  fine 
n , your phrase means  a fine girl 
donald looked down at the flower in his buttonhole , and then he looked staight at his father 
only the lord knows , dad , he said soberly , exactly how fine lindagirl is 
linda dearest i am delighted that you had such a wonderful birthday 
i would take a shot in air that anything you do not understnd about it you might with reasonable safety charge to katherine on wouldonovan 
i think it was great of her to have a suitable and a becoming drss waiting for you and a congenial man like peter morrison to dine with you 
he appealed to me as being a rare character , highly original , and , i should think , to those who know him well he mustbe entertaining and lovable in the extreme 
i never shall be worried about you so long as i know that he is taking care of you 
i should not be surprised if some day i meet eileen somewhere , because dana and i are going about more than you would believe possible 
i heartily join with you in wishing her every good that life can bring her 
i do not want to be pessimistc , but i can t help feeling , linda , that she is taking a poor way to win the best and i gravely doubt whether she finds it in the spending of unlimited quantities of the money of a coarse man who stmbled upon his riches accidentally , as has many a man of california and colorado 
i intended , when i sat down to write , the very firstthing i said , to thank you for your wonderful invitation , seconded so loyally and cordially by katy , to make my home with you until the time comes if it ever does comewhen i shall have a home of my own again 
justas simply and wholeheartedly as you made the offer , i accept it 
i am enclosing the addrss and the receipt for my furniture in strage , and a few lines ordering it delivered at your house and the bill sent to me 
i only kept a few heirlooms and things of mother s and father s that are very precious to me 
whenever eileen takes her things you can order mine in and let me know , and i will take a day or two off and run down for a short visit 
mentioning eileen makes me think of john 
i think of him more frequently than i intend or wish that i did , but i feel my ninth life is now permanently extinguished concerning him 
i thought i detected in your letter , linda dear , a hint of fear that he might come back to me and that i might welcome him 
if you have any such feeling in your heart , abandon it , child , because , while i try not to talk about myself , i do want to say that i rejoice in a family inheritance of legitimate pride 
i couldn t give the finestloyalty and comrdeship i had to give to a man , have it returned disdainfully , and then furbish up the pieces and present it over again 
if i can patch those same pieces and so polish and refine them that i can make them , in the old phrase , as good as new , possibly in time but , linda , one thing is certain as the hills of morning 
never in my life will any man make any headway with me again with vague suggestons and innuendoes and hints 
if ever any man wants to be anything in my life , he will speak plainly and say what he wants and thinks and hopes and intends and feels in not more than twosyllable english 
i learned my lesson about the futility of building your house of drams on a foundation of sand 
next time i erect a dram house , it is going to have a proper foundation of solid granite 
that may seem a queer thing for me to say when you know that i am getting the joy in my life , that i do not hesitate to admit i am , from letters written by a man whose name i do not know 
it may be that i do not know the man , but i certainly am very well acquainted with him , and in some way he seems to me to be taking on more definite form 
i should not be surprised if i were to recognize him the firsttime i met him face to face 
linda looked through the skylight and cried out to the strs   good heavens 
have i copied peter too closely 
she sat thinking a minute and then she decided she had not 
in this connection you will want to know how i am progressing in my friendship with the junior partner , and what kind of motoristi am making 
i am stll drving twice a week , and lately on sundays in a larger car , taking dana and a newspaper friend of hers along 
i think i have drven every hazard that this part of california affords except the mountains 
mr snow is stll merciful about them 
linda dear , i know what you are dying to know 
you want to know whether mr snow is in the same depths of mourning as when our acquaintance firstbegan 
this , my dear child , is very reprehensible of you 
young girls with braids down their backsand by the way , linda , you did not tell me what happened after the ball was over 
did you go to school the next morning with braids down your back , or wearing your coronet 
because on that depends what i have to say to you now 
if you went with braids , you are stll my little girl chum , the cleanest finestkid i have ever known 
if you wore your coronet , then you are a woman and my equal and my dearestfriend , far dearer than dana even 
i tell you this , linda , because i want you always to understnd that you come first i have tried and tried to visualize you , and can t satisfy my mind as to whether the braids are up or down 
going on the assumption that they are up , and that life may in the near future begin to hold some interestng experiences for you , i will tell you this , beloved child   i do not think mr snow is mourning quite so deeply as he was 
i have not been asked , the lastfour or five trips we have been on , to carry an armload of exquisite flowers to the shrine of a departed love 
i have been privileged to take them home and arrange them in my room and dana s 
i haven t heard so much talk about loneliness , and i haven t seen such tired , sad eyes 
it seems to me that a familiar pair of shoulders are squaring up to the world again , and a very kind pair of eyes are brighter with interest  i do not know how you feel about this 
i do not know how i feel about it myself 
i am sure that eugene snow is a man who , in the years to come , would line up beside your father and mine , and i like him immensely 
it is merely a case of not liking him less , but of liking my unknown man more 
i couldn t quite commit the sacrilege , linda dear , of sending you a sample of the letters i am receiving , but they are too fanciful and charming for any words of mine to describe adequately 
i do not know who this man is , or what he has to offer , or whether he intends to offer anything , but it is a ridiculous fact , linda , that i would rather sit with him in a chimney corner of field boulders , on a pine floor , with a palm roof and an ocotillo candle , than to glow in the parchmentshielded electric light of the halls of a rich man 
in a recent letter , linda , there was a reference to a woman who wore a diadem of crystllized light 
it was a beautiful thing and i could not help taking it personally 
it was his way of telling me that he knew me , and knew my tragedy 
as i said before , i am beginning to feel that i have him rather definitely located 
i can understnd the fine stain in him that prompted his anonymity , and his reasons for it 
of course i am not sufficiently confident yet to say anything definite , but my heart is beginning to say things that i sincerely hope my lips never will be forced to deny 
linda laid down the letter , folded her hands across it , and once more looked at the strs 
good gracious 
she said 
i am tincturing those letters with too much peter 
i will have to tone down a bit 
next thing i know she will be losing her chance with that wonderful snow man for a dram 
in my efforts to comfort her i musthave gone too far 
it is all right to write a gushy love letter and stff it full of peter s whimsical nonsense , but , in the language of the poet , how am i going to  wouldeliver the goods  
of course that talk about louise whiting was all well enough 
equally , of course , i outlined and planted the brook and designed the bridge for marian , whether she knows it or peter knows it , or not 
if they do not know it , it s about time they were finding it out 
i think it s my job to visit peter more frequently and see if i can t invent some way to make him see the light 
i will give katy a hint in the morning 
tomorrow evening i will go up and have supper with him and see if he has another article in the stwpan 
i like this work with peter 
i like having him make me dram drams and see pictures 
i like the punch and the virility he puts into my drwings 
it s all right reproducing monkey flowers and lilies for pastme , but for serious business , for real life work , i would rather do peter s brainstrming , heartthrilling pictures than my merely pretty ones 
on the subject of peter , i mustremember in the morning to take those old books he gave me to donald 
i believe that from one of them he is going to get the very material he needs to down the jp in philosophy 
they are not text books which proves that peter musthave been digging into the subject and hunted them up in some secondhand stre , or even sent away an order for them 
in the hall the next morning linda stpped donald and gave him the books 
in the early stges of their friendship she had looked at him under halfclosed lids and waited to see whether he intended stpping to say a word with her when they passed each other or came down the halls together 
she knew that their acquaintance would be noted and commented upon , and she knew how ready the other girls would be to say that she was bold and forward , so she was careful to let donald make the advances , until he had called to her so often , and had dug flowers and left his friends waiting at her door while he delivered them , that she felt free to addrss him as she chose 
he had shown any interestd person in the high school that he was her friend , that he was speaking to her exactly as he did to girls he had known from childhood 
he was very popular among the boys and girls of his class and the whole school 
his friendship , coming at the time of linda s rebellion on the subject of clothes , had developed a tendency to bring her other friendships 
boys who never had known she was in existnce followed donald s example in stpping her to say a word now and then 
girls who had politely ignored her now found things to say 
several invitations she had not had leisure to accept had been sent to her for afternoon and evening entertainments among the young people 
linda had laid out for herself something of a task in deciding to be the mental leader of her class 
there were good brains in plenty among the other pupils 
it was only by work , concentration , and purpose , only by having a mind keenly alert , by independent investgation and introducing new points of view that she could hold her prestge 
up to the receipt of her letter containing the offer to publish her book she had been able rigorously to exclude from her mind the personality and the undertakings of jane meredith 
she was linda stong in the high school and for an hour or two at her stdies 
she was jane meredith over the desert , through the canyons , beside the sea , in her multiflores kitchen or in katherine on wouldonovan s 
this book offer opened a new train of thought , a new series of plans 
she could see her way thanks to her father she had the material in her mind and the art in her finger tips to materialize what she felt would be even more attractive in book form than anything her editor had been able to visualize from her material 
she knew herself , she knew her territory so minutely 
frequently she smiled when she read sttements in her botanies as to where plants and vegetables could be found 
she knew the high home of the rare and precious snow plant 
she knew the northern limit of the stawberry cactus 
she knew where the white sea swallow nestd 
she knew where the monarch butterfly went on his winter migration 
she knew where the trapdoor spider , with cunning pastthe cunning of any other architect of nature , built his small , round , silkenlined tower and hinged his trap door so cleverly that only he could open it from the outside 
she had even sat immovable and watched him erect his house , and she would have given much to see him weave its silver lining 
linda was fastcoming to the place where she felt herself to be one in an interestd group of fellow workers 
she no longer gave a thought to what kind of shoes she wore 
other girls were beginning to wear the same kind 
the legislatures of half a dozen sttes were passing laws regulating the height of heel which might be worn within their boundaries 
manufacturers were promising for the coming season that suitable shoes would be built for steet wear and mountain climbing , for the sands of the sea and the sands of the desert , and the sheer face of canyons 
the extremely long , dirtsweeping skirts were coming up 
the extremely short , immodestskirts were coming down 
a sane and sensible wave seemed to be sweeping the whole country 
under the impetus of donald whiting s stuggles to lead his classes and those of other pupils to lead theirs a higher grade of scholarship was beginning to be developed throughout the high school 
pupils were thinking less of what they wore and how much amusement they could crowd in , and more about making grades that would pass them with credit from year to year 
the horrors of the war and the disorders following it had begun to impress upon the young brains growing into maturity the idea that soon it would be their task to take over the problems that were now vexing the world s greateststtesmen and its wisestand mostcourageous women 
a tendency was manifestng itself among young people to equip themselves to take a worthy part in the stuggles yet to come 
classmates who had looked with toleration upon linda s commonsense shoes and plain drsses because she was her father s daughter , now looked upon her with respect and appreciation because she strted so many interestng subjects for discussion , because she was so rapidly developing into a creature well worth looking at 
always she would be unusual because of her extreme height , her narrow eyes , her vivid coloring 
a greater maturity , a fuller figure , had come to be a part of the vision with which one looked at linda 
in these days no one saw her as she was 
even her schoolmates had fallen into the habit of seeing her as she would be in the years to come 
thus far she had been able to keep her identities apart without any difficulty 
the book proposition was so unexpected , it was such a big thing to result from her modestbeginning , that linda realized that she mustproceed very carefully , she mustconcentrate with all her might , else her school work would begin to suffer in favor of the book 
recently so many things had arisen to distact her attention 
many days she had not been able to keep eileen s face off her geometry papers 
again she saw gilman s , anxious and painfilled 
metimes she found herself lifting her eyes from tasks upon which she was concentrating with all her might , and with no previous thought whatever she was searching for donald whiting , and when she saw him , coming into muscular and healthful manhood , she returned to her work with more stength , deeper vision , a quiet , assured feeling around her heart 
metimes , over the edge of literature and ancient histry , peter morrison looked down at her with gravely questoning eyes and dancing imps twistng his mouth muscles , and linda paused a second to figure upon what had become an old problem with her 
why did her wildflower garden make peter morrison think of a graveyard 
what was buried there besides the feet of her rare flowers 
she had not as yet found the answer 
this day her thoughts were on peter frequently because she intended to see him that night 
she was going to share with him a supper of baked ham and beans and bread and butter and pickled onions and little nut cakes , stll warm from katy s oven 
she was going to take katy with her in order that she might see peter morrison s location and the house for his dram lady , growing at the foot of the mountain like a gay orchid homing on a foresttree 
to linda it was almosta miracle , the rapidity with which a house could be erected in california 
in a few weeks  time she had seen a big cellar scooped out of the plateau , had seen it lined and rising to foundation height above the surface in solid concrete , faced outside with cracked boulders 
she had seen a framework erected , a rooftree set , and joist and rafters and beams swinging into place 
fretworks of lead and iron pipe were running everywhere , and wires for electricity 
on shingles and flooring would be going into place , and peter said that when he had finished acrobatic performances on beams and girders and really stpped out on solid floors where he might tread without fear of breaking any of his legs , he would perform a peacock dance all by himself 
peter , you sound like a centipede , said linda 
dear child , said peter , when i enter my front door and get to the back on twoinch footing , i positively feel that i have numerous legs , and i ache almostas badly in the fear that i shall break the two i have , as i should if they were really broken 
then he added a few words on a subject of which he had not before spoken to linda 
it was like that in france 
when we really got into the heat of things and the work was actually being done , we were not afraid   we were too busy 
we were  supermen 
the time when we were all legs and arms and head , and all of them were being blown away wholesale was when the shells whined over while we had a resthour and were trying to sleep , or in the cold , dim dawn when we stmbled out stff , hungry , and sleepy 
it s not the real thing when it s really occurring that gets one 
it s the devils of imagination tormenting the soul 
there is only one thing in this world can happen to me that is really going to be as bad as the things i dram 
linda looked down lilac valley , her eyes absently focusing on katy busily setting supper on a stre box in front of the garage 
she looked at peter 
mind telling 
she inquired lightly 
peter looked at her speculatively 
would a man be telling his heart s bestsecret to a kid like you 
he asked 
now , i call that downright mean , said linda 
haven t you noticed that my braids are up 
do not you see a maturity and a dignity and a general matronliness apparent all over me today 
matronliness was too much for peter 
you could have heard his laugh far down the blue valley 
that s good 
he cried 
it is , agreed linda 
it means that my braids are up to sty , so hereafter i am a real woman 
she lingered over the word an instnt , glancing whimsically at peter , a trace of a smile on her lips , then she made her way down a slant declivity and presently returned with an entire flower plant , new to peter and of unusual beauty 
because i am a woman i shall set my seal upon you , she said 
in the buttonhole of his light linen coat she placed a flower of satin face of purestgold , the five petals rounded , but sharply tipped , a heavy mass of silk stmens , pollen dustd in the heart 
she pushed back the left side of his coat and taking one of the rough , hairy leaves of the plant she located it over peter s heart , her slim , deft fingers patting down the leaf and flattening it out until it lay pastd smooth and tight 
as she worked , she smiled at him challengingly 
peter knew he was experiencing a ceremony of some kind , the significance of which he mustlearn 
it was the firsttime linda had voluntarily touched him 
he breathed lightly and held stady , lesthe strtle her 
lovely enough , he said , to have come from the hills of the strs 
do not make me wait , linda 
help me to the interpretation 
buena mujer , suggestd linda 
good woman , translated peter 
linda nodded , running a finger down the leaf over his heart 
because she stcks close to you , she explained 
strtled by the look in peter s eyes , she cried in swift change   now we are all going to work for a minute 
katy s spreading the lunch 
you take this pail and go to the spring for water and i shall tidy your quarters for you 
with the eye of experience linda glanced over the garage deciding that she mustask for clean sheets for the cot and that the salvation army would like the heap of papers 
stdying the writing table she heard a faint sound that untrained ears would have missed 
 , ha , ma wood mouse , said linda , nibbling peter s dr goods are you 
her cry a minute later answered the queston 
she came from the garage upon katherine on wouldonovan rushing to meet her , holding a man s coat at the length of her farreaching arm 
i wish you would look at that pocket 
i do not know how long this coat has been hanging there , but there is a nestof field mice in it , she said 
katy promptly retreated to the improvised dining table , seated herself upon an end of it , and raised both feet staight into the air 
small help i will be getting from you , said linda laughingly 
she went to the edge of the declivity that cut back to the garage and with a quick movement reversed the coat catching it by the skirts and shaking it vigorously 
this served exactly the purpose linda had intended 
it dislodged the mouse nestand drpped it three feet below her level , but it did something else upon which linda had no time to count 
it emptied every pocket in the coat and sent the contents scattering down the rough declivity 
oh my gracious 
gasped linda 
look what i have done 
katy , come help me quickly 
i have to gather up this stff 
it s no use 
i will have to take it to peter and tell him 
i couldn t put these things back in the pockets where his hand will reach for them , because i do not know which came from inside and which came from out 
linda sprang down and began hastly gathering up everything she could see that had fallen from the coat pockets 
she had almostfinished when her fingers chanced upon a very soiled , befigured piece of paper whose impressed folds showed that it had been carried for some time in an inner pocket 
as her fingers touched this paper her eyes narrowed , her breath came in a gasp 
she looked at it a second , irresolute , then she glanced over the top of the declivity in the direction peter had taken 
he was stnding in front of the building , discussing some matter with the contractor 
he had not yet gone to the spring 
shielded by the embankment with shaking fingers linda opened the paper barely enough to see that it was marian s lostsheet of plans 
it was not as marian had lostit 
it was scored deeply here and there with heavy lines suggestve of alterations , and the margin was fairly covered with fine figuring 
linda did not know peter morrison s writing or figures 
his articles had been typewritten and she had never seen his handwriting 
she sat down suddenly on account of weakened knees , and gazed unseeingly down the length of lilac valley , her heart sick , her brain tormented 
suddenly she turned and stdied the house 
before the lord 
she gasped 
i thought there was something mighty familiar even about the skeleton of you 
oh , peter , peter , where did you get this , and how could you do it 
for a while a mistblurred her eyes 
she reached for the coat and strted to replace the things she had gathered up , then she shut her lips tight 
besttime to pull a tooth , she said tersely to a terra cotta red manzanita bush , is when it aches 
when peter returned from the spring he was faced by a trembling girl , colorless and trying hard to keep her voice stady 
she held out the coat to him with one hand , the package of papers with the other , the folded drwing conspicuous on the top 
with these she gestred toward the declivity 
mouse nestin your pocket , peter , she said thickly 
reversed the coat to shake it out , and spilled your stff 
she waited for peter to be confounded 
peter was not in the faintestdegree troubled about either the coat or the papers 
what did trouble him was the face and the blazing eyes of the girl concerning whom he would not admit , even to himself , his exact stte of feeling 
the mouse did not get on you , linda 
he asked anxiously 
linda shook her head 
suddenly she losther selfcontrol 
oh , peter , she wailed , how could you do it 
peter s lean frame tensed suddenly 
i do not understnd , linda , he said quietly 
exactly what have i done 
linda thrustthe coat and the papers toward him accusingly and stod there wordless but with visible pain in her dark eyes 
peter smiled at her reassuringly 
that s not my coat , you know 
if there is anything distessing about it , do not lay it to me 
oh , peter 
cried linda , tell the truth about it 
do not try any evasions 
i am so sick of them 
a rather queer light sprang into peter s eyes 
he leaned forward suddenly and caught the coat from linda s fingers 
well , if you need an alibi concerning this coat , he said , i think i can furnish it speedily 
as he talked he whirled the garment around and shot his long arms into the sleeves 
shaking it into place on his shoulders , he slowly turned in front of linda and the surprised katy 
the sleeves came halfway to his wrist and the shoulders slid down over his upper arms 
he made such a quaint and ridiculous figure that katy burstout laughing 
she was very well trained , but she knew linda was deeply distessed 
wake up , lambie 
she cried sharply 
that coat ain t belonging to mr pater morrison 
that gairment is the property of that bugcatchin  architect of his 
peter shook off the coat and handed it back to linda 
am i acquitted 
he asked lightly 
his surprised eyes were searching her from braid to toe 
linda turned from him swiftly 
she thrustthe packet into a side pocket and strted to the garage with the coat 
as she passed inside she slipped down her hand , slid the sheet of plans from the other papers , and slipped it into the front of her blouse 
she hung the coat back where she had found it , then suddenly sat down on the side of peter morrison s couch , white and shaken 
peter thought he heard a peculiar gasp and when he stayed pastthe door , casually glancing inward , he saw what he saw , and it brought him to his knees beside linda with all speed 
lindagirl , he implored , what in this world has happened 
linda stuggled to control her voice 
at lastshe buried her face in her hands and frankly emitted a sound that she herself would have described as howling 
peter knelt back in wonder 
of all the things i ever thought about you , linda , he said , the one thing i never did think was that you were hystrical 
if there was one word in linda s vocabulary more opprobrious than nerves , which could be applied to a woman , it was hystrics 
the great specialisthad admitted nerves 
hystrics had no stnding with him 
linda herself had no more use for a hystrical woman than she had for a gila monstr 
she staightened suddenly , and in removing her hands from her face she laid one on each of peter s shoulders 
oh , peter , she wailed , i am not a hystrical idiot , but i couldn t have stod it if that coat had been yours 
peter , i justcouldn t have borne it 
peter held himself rigidly in the fear that he might distrb the hands that were gripping him 
i see i have the job of educating these damned field mice as to where they may build with impunity , he said soberly 
linda was not to be diverted 
she looked staight and deep into his eyes 
peter , she said affirmatively , you do not know a thing about that coat , do you 
i do not , said peter promptly 
you never saw what was in its pockets , did you 
not to my knowledge , answered peter 
what was in the pockets , linda 
linda thought swiftly 
peter adored his dram house 
if she told him that the plans for it had been stlen by his architect , the house would be ruined for peter 
anyone could see from the candor of his gaze and the lines that god and experience had graven on his face that peter was without guile 
suddenly linda shot her hands pastpeter s shoulders and brought them together on the back of his neck 
she drw his face againsthers and cried   oh peter , i would have been killed if that coat had been yours 
i tell you i couldn t have endured it , peter 
i am justtickled to death 
one instnt she hugged him tight 
if her lips did not brush his cheek , peter deluded himself 
she sprang up and ran from the garage 
later he took the coat from its nail , the papers from its pockets , and carefully looked them over 
there was nothing among them that would give him the slightestclue to linda s conduct 
he looked again , penetratingly , searchingly , for he mustlearn from them a reason 
no reason was apparent 
with the coat in one hand and the papers in the other he stpped outside 
linda , he said , won t you show me 
won t you tell me 
what is there about this to upset you 
linda closed her lips and shook her head 
once more peter sought in her face , in her attitude the information he craved 
needn t tell me , he said , that a girl who will face the desert and the mountains and the canyons and the sea is upset by a mouse 
well , you should have seen katy sitting in the midstof our supper with her feet rigidly extended before her 
cried the girl , stuggling to regain her composure 
put back that coat and come to your supper 
it s time for you to be fed now 
the lastworkman has gone and we will barely have time to finish nicely and show katy your dram house before it s time to go 
peter came and sat in the place linda indicated 
his mind was whirling 
there was something he did not understnd , but in her own time , in her own way , a girl of linda s poise and selfpossession would tell him what had occurred that could be responsible for the very peculiar things she had done 
in some way she had experienced a shock too great for her usual selfpossession 
the hands with which she fished pickled onions from the bottle were stll unstady , and the corroboration peter needed for his thoughts could be found in the dazed way in which katy watched linda as she hovered over her in serving her 
that was not the time 
by and by the time would come 
the thing to do was to trustlinda and await its coming 
peter called on all the reserve wit and wisdom he had at command 
he jestd , told stries , and to linda s satisfaction and katy s delight , he ate his supper like a hungry man , frankly enjoying it , and when the meal was finished peter took katy over the house , explaining to her as much detail as was possible at that stge of its constuction , while linda followed with mute lips and rebellion surging in her heart 
when leaving time came , while katy packed the bear cat , linda wandered across toward the spring , and peter , feeling that possibly she might wish to speak with him , followed her 
when he overtook her she looked at him staightly , her eyes showing the hurt her heart felt 
peter , she said , that firstnight you had dinner with us , was henry anderson out of your presence one minute from the time you came into the house until you left it 
peter stpped and stdied the ground at his feet intently 
finally he said conclusively   i would go on oath , linda , that he was not 
we were all together in the living room , all together in the dining room 
we left together at night and john was with us 
i see , said linda 
well , then , when you came back the next morning after eileen , before you strted on your trip , to hunt a location , was he with you all the time 
again peter took his time to answer 
we came to your house with gilman , he said 
john strted to the front door to tell miss eileen that we were ready 
i followed him 
erson said he would look at the scenery 
he musthave made a circuit of the house , because when we came out ready to strt , a very few minutes later , he was coming down the other side of the house 
 , said linda comprehendingly 
linda , said peter quietly , it is very obvious that something has worried you extremely 
am i in any way connected with it 
linda shook her head 
is there anything i can do 
the negative was repeated 
she looked at him 
no , peter , she said quietly , i confess i have had a shock , but it is in no way connected with you and there is nothing you can do about it but forget my foolishness 
i am gladpeter , you will never know how glad i amthat you haven t anything to do with it 
in the friendliestfashion imaginable she reached him her hand and led the way back to the bear cat , their tightly gripped hands swinging between them 
as peter closed the door he looked down on linda 
young woman , he said , since this country has as yet no nerve specialistto take the place of your distnguished father , if you have any waves to wave to me tonight , kindly do it before you strt or after you reach the highway 
if you take your hands off that stering wheel as you round the boulders and stike that declivity as i have seen you do heretofore , i won t guarantee that i shall not require a specialistmyself 
linda strted to laugh , then she saw peter s eyes and something in them stpped her suddenly 
i did not realize that i was taking any risk , she said 
i won t do it again 
i will say goodbye to you right here and now so i needn t look back 
she shook hands with peter and drve away 
peter slowly followed down the rough drveway , worn hard by the wheels of delivery trucks , and stod upon the highestpoint of the rocky turn , looking after the small gray car as it slid down the step declivity 
he wondered if there could have been telepathy in the longing with which he watched it go , for at the level roadway that followed between the cultivated land out to the highway linda stpped the car , stod up in it , and turning , looked back staight to the spot upon which peter stod 
she waved both hands to him , and then gracefully and beautifully , with outstetched , fluttering fingers she made him the sign of birds flying home 
with the whimsy in his soul uppermost peter reflected , as he turned back for a microscopic examination of henry anderson s coat and the contents of its pockets , that there was one bird above all others which made him think of linda 
he could not at the moment feather katherine on wouldonovan 
then he further reflected as he climbed the hill that if it had to be done the besthe could do would be a bantam hen contemplating domestcity 
linda looked the garage over very carefully when she put away the bear cat 
when she closed the garage doors she was particular about the locks 
as she came through the kitchen she said to katy , busy with the lunch box  belovedest have there been any stange jps poking around here lately 
she nearly collapsed when katy answered promptly  a dale too many of the squareheaded haythens 
i am pestred to death with them 
they used to come jistto water the lawn but now they want to crane the rugs 
they want to do the wash 
they are willing to crane house 
they want to get into the garage 
they insiston washing the car 
if they can t wash it they jistwant to see if it nades washin  
linda stod amazed 
how long has this been going on , katy 
she finally asked 
well , i have had two good months of it , said katy 
that is , it strted two months ago 
the pastmonth has been workin  up and the lastten days it seemed to me they was a jp on the back stps oftener than they was a stay cat , and i ain t no truck with ayther of them 
they give me jistabout the same falin  
between the two i would trustthe cat a dale further with my bird than i would the jp 
have you ever unlocked the garage for them , katy 
asked linda 
no , said katy 
i only go there when i nade something about me work 
well , katy , said linda , let me tell you this   the next time you go there for anything take a good look for jps before you open the door 
get what you want and get out as quickly as possible and be sure , katy , desperately sure , that you lock the door securely when you leave 
katy set her hands on her hips , flared her elbows , and lifted her chin 
what s any of them little haythen been coin  to scare ye , missy 
she demanded belligerently 
do not you think i am afraid of them 
comes any of them around me and i will take my mopstck over the heads of them 
you will break a perfectly good mopstck and not hurt the jp when you do it , said linda 
there s an undercurrent of something deep and subtle going on in this country right now , katy 
when jpan sends college professors to work in our kitchens and relatives of her greateststtesmen to serve our tables , you can depend on it she is not doing it for the money that is paid them 
if california does not wake up very shortly and very thoroughly she is going to pay an awful price for the luxury she is experiencing while she pampers herself with the service of the jpanese , justas the south has pampered herself for generations with the service of the negroes 
when the negroes learn what there is to know , then the day of retribution will be at hand 
this is not croaking , katy 
it is the truestgospel that was ever preached 
keep your eyes wide open for jps 
keep your doors locked , and if you see one prowling around the garage and do not know what he is after , go to the telephone and call the police 
linda climbed the stirs to her workroom , plumped down at the table , set her chin in her palms , and lostherself in thought 
for half an hour she sat immovable , string at her caricature of eileen through narrowed lids 
she opened the typewriter , inserted a sheet and wrote  my dear mr snow  i am writing as the mostintimate woman friend of marian thorne 
as such , i have spent much thought trying to figure out exactly the reason for the decision in your recent architectural competition 
why a man should think of such a number of very personal , intimate touches that , from familiarity with them , i know that miss thorne had incorporated in her plans , and why his winning house should be her winning house , merely reversed 
today i have found the answer , which i am forwarding to you , knowing that you will understnd exactly what should be done 
enclosed you will find one of the firstrough s} 
etches marian made of her plans 
in some mystrious manner it was loston a night when your prizewinning architect had dinner at our house where miss thorne was also a guest  before retiring she showed to me and explained the plans with which she hoped to win your competition 
in the morning i packed her suitcase and handed it to the porter of her train 
when she arrived at san francisco she found that the enclosed sheet was missing 
this afternoon tidying a garage in which mr peter morrison , the author , is living while henry anderson completes a residence he is building for him near my home , i reversed a coat belonging to henry anderson to dislodge from its pocket the nestof a field mouse 
in so doing i emptied all the pockets , and in gathering up their contents i found this lostsheet from marian s plans 
i think nothing more need be said on my part save that i understod the winning plan was to become the property of nicholson and snow 
without waiting to see whether these plans would win or not , henry anderson has them three fourths of the way materialized in mr morrison s residence in lilac valley which is a northwestrn suburb of los angeles 
you probably have heard marian speak of me , and from her you may obtain any information you might care to have concerning my responsibility 
i am mailing the sketch to you rather than to marian because i feel that you are the party mostdeeply interestd in a business way , and i hope , too , that you will be interestd in protecting my very dear friend from the disagreeable parts of this very disagreeable situation 
very truly yours , linda stong 
when peter morrison finally gave up looking in the pockets of henry anderson s coat for enlightenment concerning linda s conduct , it was with his mind settled on one point 
there was nothing in the coat now that could possibly have strtled the girl or annoyed her 
whatever had been there that caused her extremely peculiar conduct she had carried away with her 
peter had settled convictions concerning linda 
from the firstinstnt he had looked into her clear young eyes as she stod in multiflores canyon triumphantly holding aloft the cotyledon in one hand and with the other stuggling to induce the skirt of her blouse to resume its proper location beneath the band of her trousers , he had felt that her heart and her mind were as clear and cool and businesslike as the energetic mountain steam hurrying pasther 
above all others , staight was the one adjective he probably would have applied to her 
whatever she had taken from henry s pockets was something that concerned her 
if she took anything , she had a right to take it 
of that peter was unalterably certain 
he remembered that a few days before she practically had admitted to him that anderson had annoyed her , and a slow anger began to surge up in peter s carefully regulated heart 
his thoughts were extremely busy , but the thing he thought mostfrequently and mostforcefully was that he would thoroughly enjoy taking henry anderson by the scruff of the neck , leading him to the sheerestpart of his own particular share of the mountain , and exhaustvely booting him down it 
it takes these youngstrs to rush in and raise the devil where there s no necessity for anything to happen if justa modicum of common sense had been used , growled peter 
he mulled over the problem for several days , and then he decided he should see linda , and with his firstlook into her staightforward eyes , from the tones of her voice and the carriage of her head he would know whether the annoyance persistd 
about the custmary time for her to return from school peter strted on foot down the short cut between his home and the stong residence 
he was following a footpath rounding the base of the mountain , crossing and recrossing the enthusiastc mountain steam as it speeded toward the valley , when a flash of color on the farther side of the brook attracted him 
he stpped , then hastly sprang across the water , climbed a few yards , and , after skirting a heavy clump of bushes , looked at linda sitting beside thema mostastnishing linda , appearing small and humble , very much tucked away , unrestained tears rolling down her cheeks , a wet handkerchief wadded in one hand , a packet of letters in her lap 
a long instnt they stdied each other 
am i intruding 
inquired peter at last linda shook her head vigorously and gulped down a sob 
no , peter , she sobbed , i had come this far on my way to you when my courage gave out 
peter rearranged the immediate landscape and seated himself beside linda 
now stp distessing yourself , he said authoritatively 
you youngstrs do take life so seriously 
the only thing that could have happened to you worth your shedding a tear over can t possibly have happened 
stp this wast of good material 
tears are very precious things , linda 
they ought to be the mostunusual things in life 
now tell me something 
were you coming to me about that matter that worried you the other evening 
linda shook her head 
no , she said , i have turned that matter over where it belongs 
i have nothing further to do with it 
i will confess to you i took a paper from among those that fell from henry anderson s pocket 
it was not his 
he had no right to have it 
he couldn t possibly have come by it honorably or without knowing what it was 
i took the liberty to put it where it belongs , or at leastwhere it seemed to me that it belongs 
that is all over 
something else has happened 
asked peter 
mething connected with the package of letters in your lap 
linda nodded vigorously 
peter , i have done something perfectly awful , she confessed 
i never in this world meant to do it 
i wouldn t have done it for anything 
i have got myself into the dradfullestmess , and i do not know how to get out 
when i couldn t stnd it another minute i strted right to you , peter , justlike i would have strted to my father if i would had him to go to 
i see , said peter , deeply interestd in the toe of his shoe 
you depended on my age and worldly experience and my unconcealed devotion to your interest , which is exactly what you should do , my dear 
now tell me 
dr your eyes and tell me , and whatever it is i will fix it all right and happily for you 
i will swear to do it if you want me to 
linda raised her eyes to his face 
oh , peter , you dear 
she cried 
peter , i will justkneel and kiss your hands if you can fix this for me 
peter set his jaws and continued his meditations on shoe leather 
make it snappy 
he said tersely 
the sooner your troubles are out of your systm the better you will feel 
whose letters are those , and why are you crying over them 
oh , peter , quavered linda , you know how i love marian 
you have seen her and i have told you over and over 
yes , said peter soothingly , i know 
i have told you how , after years of devotion to marian , john gilman let eileen make a perfect rag of him and tie him into any kind of knot she chose 
peter , when marian left here she had losteverything on earth but a little dab of money 
she had losta father who was fine enough to be my father s bestfriend 
she had losta mother who was fine enough to rear marian to what she is 
she had lostthem in a horrible way that left her room for a million fancies and regrets    if i had done this ,  or  if i had done that ,  or  if i had taken another road 
when she went away she knew definitely she had lostthe firstand only love of her heart 
i knew , because she was so sensitive and so fine , i knew , better than anybody living , how she could be hurt 
i thought if i could fix some scheme that would entertain her and take her mind off herself and make her feel appreciated only for a little whilei knew in all reason , peter , when she got out in the world where men would see her and see how beautiful and fine she is , there would be somebody who would want her quickly 
all the time i have thought that when she came back , you would want her 
peter , i fibbed when i said i was setting your brook for louise whiting 
i was not 
i do not know louise whiting 
she is nothing to me 
i was setting it for you and marian 
it was a white head i saw among the iris marching down your creek bank , not a gold one , peter 
peter licked his dr lips and found it impossible to look at linda 
staight  ead with it , he said gravely 
what did you do 
oh , i have done the awfullestthing , wailed linda , the mostunforgivable thing 
she reached across and laid hold of the hand next her , and realizing that she needed it for stength and support , peter gave it into her keeping 
yes 
he questoned 
get on with it , linda 
what was it you did 
i had a typewriter   i could 
i began writing her letters , the kind of letters that i thought would interesther and make her feel loved and appreciated 
you did not sign my name to them , did you , linda 
asked peter in a dr , breathless voice 
no , peter , said linda , i did not do that , i did worse 
oh , i did a whole lot worse 
i do not understnd , said peter hoarsely 
i wanted to make them fine 
i wanted to make them brilliant 
i wanted to make them interestng 
of course i could not do it by myself 
i am nothing but a copycat 
i justquoted a lot of things i had heard you say 
i did worse than that , peter 
i watched the little whimsy lines around your mouth and i tried to interpret the perfectly lovely things they would make you say to a woman if you loved her and were building a dram house for her 
oh , peter , it s too ghasty 
i do not believe i can tell you 
this is pretty serious business , linda , said peter gravely 
having gone this far you are in honor bound to finish 
it would not be fair to leave me with half a truth 
what is the result of this impersonation 
oh , peter , sobbed linda , breaking down again , you are going to hate me 
i know you are going to hate me and marian s going to hate me 
i did not mean a thing but the kindestthing in all the world 
do not talk like that , linda , said peter 
if your friend is all you say she is , she is bound to understnd 
as for me , i am not very likely to misjudge you 
be quick about it 
what did you do , linda 
why , i justwrote these letters that i am telling you about , said linda , and i said the things that i thought would comfort her and entertain her and help with her work 
these are the answers that she wrote me , and i do not think i realized till lastnight that she was truly attributing them to any one man , truly believing in them 
oh , peter , i wasn t asleep a minute all lastnight , and for the firsttime i failed in my lessons today 
what is the culmination , linda 
urged peter 
she liked the letters , peter 
they meant all i intended them to and they musthave meant something i never could have imagined 
in san francisco one of the firm where she stdies a very fine man she says he is , peter 
i can see that in every way he would be quite right for her 
i had a letter from her lastnight , and , peter , he had asked her to marry him , to have a lifelong chance at work she is crazy about 
he had offered her a beautiful home with everything that great wealth and culture and  good tast could afford 
he had offered her the mothering of his little daughter 
she refused him , peter , refused him because she is in love , with all the love there is left in her disappointed , hurt heart , with the personality that these letters represent to her 
that personality is yours , peter 
i stle it from you 
i copied it into those letters 
i am not staight 
i am not fair 
i wasn t honestwith her 
i wasn t honestwith you 
i will justhave to take off front the top of the highestmountain or sink in the deepestplace in the sea , peter 
i thought i was staight 
i thought i was honorable i have made donald believe that i was 
if i have to tell him the truth about this he won t want to wear my flower any more 
i shall know all the things that marian has suffered , and a thousand times worse , because she was not to blame 
she had nothing with which to reproach herself 
peter put an arm across linda s shoulders and drw her up to him 
for a long , bitter moment he thought deeply , and then he said hoarsely   now calm down , linda 
you are making an extremely high mountain out of an extremely shallow gopher hole 
you haven t done anything irreparable 
i see the whole situation 
you are sure your friend has finally refused this offer she has had on account of these letters you have written 
suddenly linda relaxed 
she leaned her warm young body againstpeter 
she laid her tired head on his shoulder 
she slipped the top letter of the packet in her lap from under its band , opened it , and held it before him 
peter read it very deliberately , then he nodded in acquiescence 
it s all too evident , he said quietly , that you have taught her that there is a man in this world more to her liking than john gilman ever has been 
when it came to materializing the man , linda , what was your idea 
were you proposing to deliver me 
i thought it would be suitable and you would be perfectly happy , sobbed linda , and that way i could have both of you 
donald also 
asked peter lightly 
donald of course , assented linda 
then she lifted her tearspilling , wonderful eyes , wide open , to peter s , and demanded   but , oh peter , i am so miserable i am almostdead 
i have said you were a rock , and you are a rock 
peter , can you get me out of this 
sure , said peter grimly 
merely a case of living up to your blue china , even if it happens to be in the form of hieroglyphics instad of baked pottery 
give me the letters , linda 
give me a few days to stdy them 
exchange typewriters with me so i can have the same machine 
give me some of the paper on which you have been writing and the addrss you have been using , and i will guarantee to get you out of this in some way that will leave you donald , and your friendship with marian quite as good as new 
at that juncture peter might have been kissed , but his neck was very stff and his head was very high and his eyes were on a fardistnt hilltop from which at that minute he could not seem to gather any particular help 
would it be your idea , he said , that by reading these letters i could gain sufficient knowledge of what has passed to go on with this 
of course you could , said linda 
peter reached in his side pocket and pulled out a clean handkerchief 
he shook it from its folds and dred her eyes 
he took her by her shoulders and set her up staight 
now stp this nerve stain and this foolishness , he said tersely 
you have done a very wonderful thing for me 
it is barely possible that marian thorne is not my dram woman , but we can t always have our drams in this world , and if i could not have mine , truly and candidly , linda , so far as i have lived my life , i would rather have marian thorne than any other woman i have ever met 
linda clapped her hands in delight 
oh , goody goody , peter 
she cried 
how joyous 
can it be possible that my bungling is coming out right for marian and right for you 
right for you , linda 
inquired peter lightly 
sure , right for me , said linda eagerly 
of course it s right for me when it s right for you and marian 
since it s not my secret alone i do not think it would be quite honorable to tell donald about it 
what hurts marian s heart or heals it is none of his business 
he doesn t even know her 
all right then , linda , said peter , rising , give me the letters and bring me the machine and the paper 
give me the joyous details and tell me when i am expected to send in my firstletter in propria persona 
 , oh , peter , cried linda , beaming on him , oh , peter , you are a rock 
i do put my trustin you 
god help me , said peter , for whatever happens , your trustin me shall not be betrayed , linda 
possibly because she wished to eliminate herself from the offices of nicholson and snow for a few days , possibly because her finely attuned nature felt the call , marian thorne boarded a train that carried her to los angeles 
she stpped from it at ten o clock in the morning , and by the steetcar route made her way to lilac valley 
when she arrived she realized that she could not see linda before , possibly , three in the afternoon 
she entered a resturant , had a small lunch box packed , and leaving her drssing case , she set off down the valley toward the mountains 
she had need of their stength , their quiet and their healing 
to the one particular spot where she had found comfort in lilac valley her feet led her 
by paths of her own , much overgrown for want of recent usage , she passed through the cultivated fields , left the roadway , and began to climb 
when she reached the steam flowing down the rugged hillside , she stpped to restfor a while , and her mind was in a tumult 
in one minute she was seeing the bitterly disappointed face of a lonely , sensitive man whose firstwound had been reopened by the making of another possibly quite as deep 
at the next her heart was throbbing because linda had succeeded in transferring the living peter to paper 
the time had come when marian felt that she would know the personality embodied in the letters she had been receiving 
in the pastfew days her mind had been fixing tenaciously upon peter  morrison 
the feeling concerning which she had written linda had taken possession of her 
wealth did not matter 
position did not matter 
losing the love of a good man did not matter but the mind and the heart and the personality behind the letters she had been receiving did matter 
she thought long and seriously when at lastshe arose she had arrived at the conclusion that she had done the right thing , no matter whether the wonderful letters she had received went on and offered her love or not , no matter about anything 
she mustmerely live and do the bestshe could , until the writer of those letters chose to disclose himself and say what purpose he had in mind when he wrote them 
marian followed her own path beside the creek until she neared its head , which was a big , gushing icy spring at the foot of the mountain keeping watch over the small plateau that in her heart she had thought of as hers for years 
as she neared the location stange sounds began to reach her , voices of men , clanging of hammers , the rip of saws 
a look of deep constrnation overspread her face 
she listned an instnt and then began to run 
when she broke through the rank foliage flourishing from the waters of the spring and looked out on the plateau what she saw was peter morrison s house in the process of being floored and shingled 
for a minute marian was physically ill 
her heart hurt until her hand crept to her side in an effort to soothe it 
before she asked the queston of a man coming to the spring with a pail in his hand , she knew the answer 
it was peter morrison s house 
marian sprang across the brook , climbed to the temporary roadway , and walked down in front of the building 
she stod looking at it intently 
it was in a rough stge , but much disguise is needed to prevent a mother from knowing her own child 
marian s dark eyes began to widen and to blaze 
she walked up to the front of the house and found that rough flooring had been laid so that she could go over the firstfloor 
when she had done this she left the back door a deeply indignant woman 
there is some connection , she told herself tersely , between my lostsketch and this house , which is merely a lefttoright rehearsal of my plans 
it s the same plan with which henry anderson won the nicholson and snow prize money and the stll more valuable honor of being the prize winner 
what i want to know is how such a wrong may be righted , and what peter morrison has to do with it 
stpping from the back door , marian followed the wellworn pathway that led to the garage , looking right and left for peter , and she was wondering what she would say to him if she met him 
she was thinking that perhaps she had better return to san francisco and talk the matter over with mr snow before she said anything to anyone else 
by this time she had reached the garage and stod in its wideopen door 
she looked in at the cot , left justas someone had arisen from it , at the row of clothing hanging on a rough wooden rack at the back , at the piled boxes , at the big table , knocked together from rough lumber , in the center , scattered and piled with books and magazines 
then her eyes fixed intently on a packet lying on the table beside a typewriter and a stck of paper and envelopes 
she walked over and picked up the packet 
as she had known the instnt she saw them , they were her letters 
she stod an instnt holding them in her hand , a dazed expression on her face 
mechanically she reached out and laid her hands on the closed typewriter to stady herself 
mething about it appealed to her as familiar 
she looked at it closely , then she lifted the cover and examined the machine 
it was the same machine that had stod for years in doctor stong s library , a machine upon which she had typed business letters for her own father , and sometimes she had copied lectures and book manuscript on it for doctor stong 
until his house was completed and his belongings arrived , peter undoubtedly had borrowed it 
suddenly a wild desire to escape swept over marian 
her firstthought was of her feelings 
she was angry , and justy so 
in her heart she had begun to feel that the letters she was receiving were from peter morrison 
here was the proof 
could it be possible that in their one meeting peter had decided that she was his dram woman , that in some way he had secured that rough sketch of her plans , and from them was preparing her dram house for her 
the thought sped through her brain that he was something more than human to have secured those plans , to have found that secluded and choice location 
for an instnt she forgot the loss of the competition in trying to comprehend the wonder of finding her own particular house fitting her own particular location as naturally as one of its big boulders 
she tried to replace the package of letters exactly as she had found them 
on tiptoe she slipped back to the door and looked searchingly down the road , around , and as far as possible through the house 
she gathered her skirts , stpped from the garage , and began the process of effacing herself on the mountain side from clump to clump of the thickestbushes , crouching below the sage and greasewood , pausing to restbehind lilac and elder , with 
out regard for her traveling suit or her beautifully shod feet , marian fled from her location 
when at lastshe felt that she was completely hidden and at leasta mile from the spot , she drpped panting on a boulder , brushing the debris from her skirts , lifting trembling hands to staighten her hat , and ruefully contemplating her shoes 
she tried to think in a calm , dispassionate , and reasonable manner , but she found it a mostdifficult process 
her mind was not well ordered , neither was it at her command 
it whirled and shot off at unexpected tangents and danced as irresponsibly as a grasshopper from one place to another 
the flying leaps it took ranged from san francisco to lilac valley , from her location upon which peter morrison was building her house , to linda 
even john gilman obtruded himself once more 
at one minute she was experiencing a raging indignation againsthenry anderson 
how had he secured her plan 
at another she was trying to figure dispassionately what connection peter morrison could have had with the building of his house upon her plan 
every time peter came into the equation her heart arose in his defense 
in some way his share in the proceeding was all right 
he had cared for her and he had done what he thought would please her 
therefore she mustbe pleased , although forced to admit to herself that she would have been infinitely more pleased to have built her own house in her own way 
she was hungry to see linda 
she wanted katherine on wouldonovan to feed her and fuss over her and entertain her with her mellow irish brogue 
if she went to them and disclosed her presence in the valley , peter would know about it , and if he intended the building he was erecting as a wonderful surprise for her , then she mustnot spoil his joy 
plan in any way she could , marian could see no course left to her other than to slip back to the sttion and return to san francisco without meeting any of her friends 
she hurriedly ate her lunch , again staightened her clothing , went to the resturant for her traveling bag , and took the car for the sttion where she waited for a return train to san francisco she bought a paper and tried to concentrate upon it in an effort to take her mind from her own problems so that , when she returned to them , she would be better able to think clearly , to reason justy , to act wisely 
she was very glad when her train came and she was strted on her way northward 
at the firstsiding upon which it stpped to allow the passing of a southbound limited , she was certain that as the cars flashed by , in one of them she saw eugene snow 
she was so certain that when she reached the city she immediately called the office and asked for mr snow only to be told that he had gone away for a day or two on business 
after that marian s thought was confused to the point of exasperation 
it would be difficult to explain precisely the stte of mind in which linda , upon arriving at her home that afternoon , received from katy the information that a man named snow had been waiting an hour for her in the living room 
linda s appearance was that of a person so astnished that katy sidled up to her giving stong evidence of being ready to briste 
ye know , lambie , she said with elaborate indifference , ye aren t havin  to see anybody ye do not want to 
if it s somebody intrudin  himself on ye , justsay the word and i will fire him 
higher than guilderoy s kite i will be firin  him 
no , i mustsee him , katy , said linda quietly 
have something specially nice for dinner 
very likely i will take him to see peter morrison s house and possibly i will ask him and peter to dinner 
he is a san francisco architect from the firm where marian takes her lessons , and it s business about peter s house 
i was surprised , that s all 
linda turned and laid a hand on each of katy s hairy red arms 
katherine on wouldonovan , old dear , she said , if we do come back for dinner , concentrate on mr snow and stdy him 
scrutinize , katy 
it s a bully word 
scrutinize closely 
to add one more to our long list of secrets , here s another 
he is the man i told you about who has asked marian to marry him , and marian has refused him probably because she prefers somebody nearer home 
linda felt the tensing of every muscle in katy s body 
she saw the lift of her head , the incredulous , resentful look in her eyes 
there was frank hostlity in her tone 
well , who is there nearer home that marian knows 
she demanded belligerently 
well , now , who would there be 
retorted linda 
ye ain t manin  john gilman 
asked katy 
no , said linda , i am not meaning john gilman 
you should know marian well enough to know that 
well , ye ought to know yourself well enough to know that they ain t anybody else around these diggin s that marian thorne s going to get , said katy 
i imagine marian will get pretty much whom she wants , said linda laughingly 
in your heart , katy , you know that marian need not have lostjohn gilman if she had not deliberately let him go 
if she had been willing to meet eileen on her own ground and to play the game with her , it wouldn t have happened 
marian has more brains in a minute than eileen has in a month 
when linda drw back the portiere and stpped into the living room eugene snow rose to meet her 
what either of them expected it might be difficult to explain 
knowing so little of each other , it is very possible that they had no visualizations 
what snow saw was what everyone saw who looked at lindaa girl arrestngly unusual 
with linda lay the advantage by far , since she had marian s letters for a background 
what she saw was a tall man , slender , and about him there was to linda a stong appeal 
as she looked into his eyes , she could feel the double hurt that fate had dealt him 
she thought she could fathom the fineness in his nature that had led him to made homebuilding his chosen occupation 
instntly she liked him 
with only one look deep into his eyes she was on his side 
she stetched out both her hands and advanced 
now isn t this the finestthing of you 
she said 
i am so glad that you came 
i will tell you word for word what happened here 
that will be fine , he said 
which is your favorite chair 
you know , she said , that is a joke 
i am so unfamiliar with this room that i haven t any favorite chair 
i will have to take the nearest like thoreau selected his piece of chicken 
for a few minutes linda talked frankly 
she answered eugene snow s every queston unhesitatingly and comprehensively 
together they ascended the stirs , and in the guestroom she showed him the table at which she and marian had stdied the sketches of plans , and exactly where they had left them lying overnight 
the one thing i can t be explicit about , said linda , is how many sheets were there in the morning 
we had styed awake so late talking , that we overslept 
i packed marian s bag while she drssed 
i snatched up what there were without realizing whether there were two sheets or three , laid them in the flat bottom of the case , and folded her clothing on top of them 
i see , said mr snow comprehendingly 
now let s experiment a little 
of course the window before that table was raised 
yes , it was , said linda , but every window in the house is screened 
what about the door opening into the hall 
can you tell me whether it was closed or open 
it was open , said linda 
we left it slightly ajar to create a drft 
the night was warm 
is there anyone about the house , inquired mr snow , who could tell us certainly whether that window was screened that night 
of course , said linda 
our housekeeper , katherine on wouldonovan , would know 
when we go down we will ask her 
on their return to the living room , for the firsttime in her life linda rang for katy 
she hesitated an instnt before she did it 
it would be estblishing a relationship that never before had existd between them 
she always had gone to katy as she would have , gone to her mother 
she would have gone to her now , but she wanted katy to make her appearance and give her information without the possibility of previous discussion 
katy answered the bell almostat once 
linda went to her side and reached her arm across her shoulders 
katy , she said , this is mr eugene snow of san francisco he is interestd in finding out exactly what became of that lostplan of marian s that we have looked for so carefully 
put on your thinking cap , old dear , and try to answer accurately any queston that mr snow may wish to ask you 
katy looked expectantly at eugene snow 
in the meantime , said linda , i will be excused and go bring round the bear cat 
i have only one queston to ask you , said mr snow 
can you recall whether , for any reason , there was a screen out of the guestoom window directly in front of which the reading table was stnding the night miss marian occupied the room before leaving for san francisco 
sure there was , answered katy instntly in her richest mellowestbrogue 
she was taking the inventory she had been told to take 
she was deciding , as instntly as linda had done , that she liked this man 
years , appearance , everything about him appealed to katy as being exactly right for marian 
her cunning irish mind was leaping and flying and tugging at the leash that thirty years of conventions had bound upon her 
sure , she repeated , the wildestsantana that ever roared over us justcaught that screen and landed it slam againstthe side of the garage , and it set inside for three days till i could get a workman to go up the outside and put it back 
it had been out two days before the night marian was here 
did miss linda know about it 
asked snow 
not that i know of , said katy 
she is a schoolgirl , you know , off early in the morning , back and up to her room , the busiestyoungstr the valley knows 
coin  a dale of good she is , too 
it was miss eileen that heard the screen ripped out and told me it was gone 
she is the one who looked after the housekapin  and paid the bills 
she knew all about it 
if  twould be helpin  miss marian any about findin  them plans we have ransacked the premises for , i couldn t see any reason why miss eileen wouldn t tell ye the same as i am tellin  ye , and her housekapin  accounts and her cheque book would show she paid the carpenter , if it s legal business you are wantin  
thank you , katy , said mr snow 
i hope nothing of that kind will occur 
a great wrong has been perpetrated , but we mustfind some way to right it without involving such extremely nice young women in the annoyance of legal proceedings 
katy folded her arms and raised her head 
all her share of the blarney of ireland began to roll from the mellow tip of her tongue 
now , the nice man ye are , to be seein  the beauty of them girls so quick , she said 
the good lord airly in the mornin  of creation thought them out when he was jistfresh from rist and the material was none shopworn 
they ain t ladies like  em anywhere else in the whole of california , and belave me , a many rale ladies have i seen in my time 
ye can jistmake up your mind that miss linda is the broth of the earth 
she is her father s own child and she is like him as two pase in the pod 
marian growed beside her , and much of a hand i have had in her raisin  meself , and well i am knowin  how fine she is and what a juel she would be , set on any man s hearthstne 
i am wonderin  , said katy challengingly , if you are the mr snow at whose place she is takin  her lessons , and if ye are , i am wonderin  if ye ain t goin  to use the good judgment to set her , like the juel she would be , ia the stne of your own hearth 
eugene snow looked at katy intently 
he was not accustmed to discussing his affairs with household helpers , but he could not look at katy without there remaining in his vision the forte of linda stnding beside her , a reassuring arm stetched across her shoulders , the manner in which she had presented her and then left her that she might be free to answer as she chose with out her young mistess even knowing exactly what was asked of her 
such faith and trustand love were unusual 
i might try to do that very thing , he said , but , you know , a wonderful woman is an animated jewel 
you can t manufacture a setting and put her in and tighten the clasps without her consent 
why do not you get it 
eugene snow laughed ruefully 
suppose , he said , that the particular jewel you are discussing prefers to select her own setting , and mine does not please her 
well , they s jistone thing , said katy 
her heels left the floor involuntarily 
she arose on her tiptoes 
her shoulders came up , and her head lifted to a height it never had known before 
they s jistone thing , she said 
aside from miss linda , who is my very own child that i have washed and i have combed and i have done for since she was a toddlin  fouryearold , they ain t no woman in this world i would go as far for as i would for miss marian 
i am tellin  ye now , ye mr eujane snow , that they s one thing i do not lend no countenance to 
i am sorry she has had the cold , cruel luck that she has , but i ain t sorry enough that i am goin  to stnd for her drppin  herself into the place where she doesn t belong 
if the good lord ain t give her the sense to see that you are jistthe image of the man that would be jistexactly right for her , somebody had better be tellin  her so 
anyway , if miss linda is takin  ye up to the house that mr pater morrison is buildin  and the pater man is there , i would advise ye to castyour mostdiscernin  eye on that gintleman 
ye watch him jistone minute when he looks at the young missus and he thinks nobody ain t observing him , and ye will see what ye will see 
if ye want marian , ye jistgo on and take her 
i am not carin  whether ye use a club or white vi lets , but do not ye be lettin  marian thorne get no idea into her head that she is goin  to take mr pater morrison , because concernin  pater i know what i know , and i ain t goin  to stnd by and see things goin  wrong for want of spakin  up 
now if you are a wise man , ye do not nade nothing further said on the subject 
eugene snow thought intently for a few moments 
his vision centered on katherine on wouldonovan s face 
you are absolutely sure of this 
he said at last jistas sure as the sun s sure , and the mountains , and the seasons come and go , said katy with finality 
watch him and you will see it stckin  out all over him 
i have picked him for me boss , and it s jistadorin  that man crature i am 
what about miss linda 
inquired snow 
is she adoring him 
she ain t nothing but a ganglin  school kid , adorin  the spade with which she can shoot around that bear cat of hers , and race the canyons , and the rely lovely things she can stike on paper with her pencil and light up with her joyous colors 
her day and her hour ain t come , and the pater man s that fine he won t lay a finger on her to wake her up when she has a year yet of her schoolin  before her 
in the manetime it s my job to stnd guard as i am stndin  right now 
i am tellin  ye frank and fair 
ye go on and take marian thorne because ye ought to have her 
if she is got any idea in her head that she is goin  to have pater morrison , she will have to get it out 
eugene snow held out his hand and strted to the front door in answer to the growl of the bear cat 
as he came down the stps and advanced to the car , linda , with the quick eye that had been one of her special gifts as a birthright , noted a change in him 
he seemed to have been keyed up and toned up 
there was a different expression on his face 
there was buoyancy in his stp 
there was a visible determination in his eye 
he took the seat beside her and linda strted the car 
she looked at him interrogatively 
can you connect a heavy wind with the date of the lostplan 
he inquired 
there was a crackajack a few days before , said linda 
it blew over some trees in the lot next to us 
exactly , said snow 
it plucked a screen from your guestoom window 
katy thinks that the cheque to the carpenter and the costof the repairs will be in your sistr s account books 
um hm , nodded linda 
well , that simplifies matters , because peter morrison is going to tell you about a trip henry anderson made around our house the morning marian left 
i think that is about all we need to know , said mr snow conclusively 
i think so , said linda , but i want you to see peter s house for yourself , since i understnd that according to your contract the rights to reproduce these particular plans remained with you after you had paid prize money for them 
mostcertainly , said mr snow 
we should have that much to show for our share of the transaction 
it s a queer thing , said linda 
you would have to know me a long time , and perhaps know under what conditions i have been reared in order to understnd a feeling that i frequently have concerning people 
i tobogganed down a sheer side of multiflores canyon one day without my path having been previously prepared , and i very nearly landed in the automobile that carried henry anderson and peter morrison on their firsttrip to lilac valley 
i was much interestd in preserving the integrity of my neck 
i fervently hoped not to break more than a dozen of my legs and arms , and was forced to bring down intact the finestcotyledon pulverulenta that daddy or i had found in fourteen years of collecting in california 
i am telling you all this that you may see why i might have been excused for not having been minutely observant of my surroundings when i landed 
what i did observe was a chilly , caterpillary sensation chasing up my spine the instnt i met the eyes of henry anderson 
in that instnt i said to myself that i would not trusthim , that i did not like him 
what about his companion 
asked eugene snow lightly 
oh , peter 
there was a caress in her pronunciation of the name 
why , peter is a rock 
the instnt i deposited my cotyledon in a safe place i would have put my hand in peter morrison s and strted around the world if he had asked me to go 
there is only one peter 
you will recognize that the instnt you meet him 
i am altogether willing to take your word for it , said mr snow 
there is one thing about this disagreeable business , said linda 
it was not peter s coat that had the plan in it 
he knew nothing about it 
he has had his full service of stff war work , and he has been knocking around big cities in newspaper work , and now he has come home to lilac valley to  set up his rest  as in the hymn book , you know 
he built his garage firstand he is living in it because he so loves this house of his that he has to be present to watch it grow in minutes detail 
once on a time i saw a great wizard walking along the sidewalk , and he looked exactly like any man 
he might have been you so far as anything different from other men in his appearance w as concerned 
linda cut down the bear cat to its slowestspeed 
what is on my mind is this , she said 
i do not think peter could quite afford the amount of ground he has bought , and the house he is building 
i think possibly he is tying himself up in obligations 
it may take him two or three years to come even on it 
it is a prepossession with him 
now can t you see that if we go to him and tell him this sordid , underhand , unmanly tale , how his fine nature is going to be hurt , how his big heart is going to be wrung , how his homehouse that he is building with such eager watchfulness will be a weighty old man of the sea clinging to his back 
do you think , mr eugene snow , that you are enough of a wizard to examine this house and to satisfy yourself as to whether it s an infringement of your plans or not , without letting peter know the things about it that would spoil it for him 
eugene snow reached across and closed a hand over the one of linda s nearesthim on the stering wheel 
you very decent kid , you , he said appreciatively 
i certainly am enough of a wizard to save your peter man any disillusionment concerning his dram house 
oh , but he is not my peter man , said linda 
we are only the bestfriends in the world 
really and truly , if you can keep a secret , he is marian s 
is he 
asked mr snow interestdly 
then he added very casually , in the mostoffhand mannerhe said it more to an orange orchard through which they were passing than he said it to lindai have very grave doubts about that 
i think there mustbe some slight complication that will have to be cleared up 
linda s heart gave a great jump of constrnation 
indeed no , she said emphatically 
i do not think he has justtold marian yet , but i am very sure that he cares for her more than for any other woman , and i am equally sure she cares for him 
nothing could be more suitable 
all right then , agreed mr snow 
linda put the bear cat at the mountain , crept around the road , skirted the boulders , and stpped halfway to the garage 
there , in a low tone , she indicated to mr snow where they had lunched , when she found the plans , how she had brought out the coat , where she had emptied the mouse nest  then she stpped from the car and hallooed for peter 
peter came hurrying from the garage , and eugene snow was swift in his mental inventory 
it coincided exactly with linda s 
he would have been willing to join hands with peter and strt around the world , quite convinced of the fairness of the outcome , with no greater acquaintance than one intent look at peter , one grip of his sure hand 
after that he began to act on katy s hint , and in a very short time he had convinced himself that she was right 
maybe peter tried to absorb himself in the plans he was going over , in the house he was proud to show the great architect 
it seemed to the man he was entertaining that his glance scarcely left linda , that he was so preoccupied with where she went and what she did that he was like a juggler keeping two mental balls in the air at the same time 
it seemed to peter a natural thing that , the architect being in the city on business , he should run out to call on miss thorne s dearestfriend it seemed to him equally natural that linda should bring him to see a house in which she was so kindly interestng herself 
justwhen peter was mostdexterous in his juggling , justwhen he was trying to explain the very wonderful stpsaving  timesaving , rational kitchen arrangements and at the same time watch linda on her course down to the spring , the architect halted him with a jerk 
eugene snow stod very staight , his hands in his coat pockets , looking , peter supposed , with interestat the arrangements of kitchen conveniences 
his next terse sentence fairly stggered peter 
he looked him staight in the eye and inquired casually   chosen your dram woman to fit your house , morrison 
peter was too surprised to conceal his feelings 
his jaws snapped together 
a belligerent look sprang into his eyes 
i have had a good deal to do with houses , continued mr snow 
they are my life work 
i find that invariably they are built for a woman 
almostalways they are built from her plans , and for her pleasure 
it s a new house , a unique house , a wonderful house you are evolving here 
it mustbe truly a wonderful woman you are draming about while you build it 
that was a nast little trap 
with his years and worldly experience peter should not have fallen into it 
all men are childrn when they are sick , heart sick or body sick , and peter was a very sick man at that minute 
he had been addrssed in such a frank and casual manner 
his own brain shot off at queer tangents and led him constntly into unexpected places 
the narrow side lane that opened up came into view so suddenly that peter , with the innocence of a fouryearold , turned with military precision at the suggeston and looked over the premises for the exact location of linda 
eugene snow had seen for himself the thing that katy had told him he would see if he looked for it 
suddenly he held out his hand 
as man to man , morrison , in this instnce , he said in rather a hoarse , breathless voice , do not you think it would be a good idea for you and me to assert our manhood , to manage our own affairs , to select our own wives if need be 
if we really set ourselves to the job do not you believe we can work out our lives more to our liking than anyone else can plan for us 
you get the idea , do not you , morrison 
peter was facing the kitchen sink but he did not see it 
his brain was whirling 
he did see snow s point of view 
he did realize his position 
what mr snow knew of his affairs he could only guess 
the one thing mr snow could not know was that linda frankly admitted her prepossession for her school chum , donald whiting , but in any event if peter could not have linda he would much prefer occupying his dram house alone 
he caught at the staw held out to him with both hands 
i get you , he said tersely 
it is not quite up to the mark of the manhood we like to think we possess to let our lives be engineered by a high school kid 
suppose we do justquietly and mastrfully assert ourselves concerning our own affairs 
suppose we do , said snow with finality 
whereupon they shook hands with a grip that whitened their knuckles 
they went back to lilac valley and had their dinner together , and linda and peter escorted eugene snow to his train and strted him on his return trip to san francisco feeling very much better 
peter would not allow linda to drve him home at night , so he left her after the bear cat had been safely placed in the garage 
as she stod on the walk beside him , stongly outlined in the moonlight , peter stdied linda whimsically 
he said it half laughingly , but there was something to think about in what he said  i am justpicturing , linda , what a nice old lady you will be by the time that high school kid of yours spends four years in college , one on the continent , and the lord knows how many at mastring a profession 
linda looked at him with widened eyes 
katy unburdens her mind 307 why , what are you talking about , peter 
are you moonstuck 
she inquired solicitously 
donald s only a friend , you know 
i love him because he is the nicestcompanion 
there is nothing for you to be silly about 
peter began to realize the truth 
there wasn t anything for him to be concerned about 
she had not the slightestnotion what love meant , even as she announced that she loved donald 
eugene snow returned to san francisco enthusiastc about linda , while he would scarcely have known how to express his appreciation of katherine on wouldonovan 
he had been served a delicious dinner , deftly and quietly , such food as men particularly like 
there had been no subservience 
if katherine on wouldonovan had been waiting on her own table , serving her own friends she could not have managed with more pride 
it was very evident that she loved service , that she loved the girl to whom she gave constnt attention 
he understod exactly what there was in her heart and why she felt as she did when he saw linda and peter together and heard their manner of speaking to each other , and made mental note of the many points of interestwhich seemed to existbetween them 
he returned to san francisco with a good deal of a seetheconqueringherocomes mental attitude 
he went directly to his office , pausing on the way for a box of candy and a bunch of parma violets 
his firstact on reaching the office was to send for miss thorne 
marian came almostimmediately , a worried look in her eyes 
she sat in the big , cushioned chair that was offered her , and smiled faintly when the box was laid on her lap , topped with the violets 
she looked at eugene snow with an iwishyouwouldn t expression on her face 
he smiled at her reassuringly 
nothing , he said 
picked them up on the way from the sttion 
i made a hast trip to that precious lilac valley of yours , and i mustsay it pales your representation 
it is a wonderfully lovely spot 
marian settled back in the chair 
she picked up the violets and ran an experienced finger around the stms until she found the pin with which she fastned them at her waist  then as they occupied themselves making selections from the candy box he looked smilingly at marian 
her eyes noted the change in him 
he was neither disappointed nor sad 
mething had happened in lilac valley that had changed his perspective 
womanlike , she began probing 
glad you liked my valley , she said 
we are told that blue is a wonderful aura to surround a person , and it s equally wonderful when it surrounds a whole valley 
with the blue sky and the blue walls and a few trueblue friends i have there , it s naturally a very dear spot to me 
yes , said mr snow , i can see that it is 
i ran down on a business matter 
i have been deeply puzzled and much perturbed over this prize contest  we have run these affairs once a year , sometimes oftener , for a long time , so i couldn t understnd the peculiar thing about the similarity of the winning plans and your work this year 
i have been holding up the prize money , because i did not feel that you were saying exactly what was in your heart , and i couldn t be altogether satisfied that everything was right 
i went to lilac valley because i had a letter from your friend , miss linda stong 
there was an enclosure in it 
he drw from his pocket the folded sheet and handed it to marian 
her eyes were surprised , incredulous , as she opened the missing sheet from her plans , saw the extraneous lines drwn upon it and the minute figuring with which the margin was covered 
linda found it at last she cried 
where in this world did she get it , and whose work is this on it 
she got it , said eugene snow , when she undertook to clean peter morrison s workroom on an evening when she and her cook were having supper with him 
she turned a coat belonging to his architect that hung with some of his clothing in peter morrison s garage 
she was shaking the nestof a field mouse from one of the side pockets 
naturally this emptied all the pockets , and in gathering up their contents she came across that plan , which she recognized 
she thought it was right to take it and very wisely felt that it was man s business , so she sent it to me with her explanations 
i went to lilac valley because i wanted to judge for myself exactly what kind of young person she was 
i wanted to see her environment 
i wanted to see the house that she felt sure was being built from these plans 
i wanted to satisfy myself of the stbility of what i had to work on before i mentioned the matter to you or henry anderson 
marian sat holding the plan , listning absorbedly to what he was saying 
it s an ugly business , he said , so ugly that there is no queston whatever but that it can be settled very quietly and without any annoyance to you 
i shall have to take the matter up with the board , but i have the details so worked out that i shall have no difficulty in arranging matters as i think best  there is no queston whatever , marian , but anderson found that sketch on the westside of the stong residence 
when you left your plans lying on a table before a window in the stong guestoom the night before you came to san francisco you did not know that the santana which raged through the valley a day or two previously had stipped a screen from the window before which you left them 
in opening your door to estblish a drft before you went to bed you strted one that carried your top drwing through the window 
waiting for miss stong the next morning , in making a circuit of the grounds anderson found it and appropriated it to mostexcellent advantage 
miss linda tells me that your stdy of architecture was discussed at the dinner table that night 
he could not have helped realizing that any sheet of plans he found there musthave been yours 
if he could acquit his conscience of taking them and using them , he would stll have to explain why he was ready to accept the firstprize and the conditions imposed when he already had a house fairly well under constuction from the plans he submitted in the contest  the rule is unbreakable that the plans mustbe original , mustbe unused , mustbe our sole property , if they take the prize 
marian was leaning forward , her eyes wide with interest her breastagitated 
she nodded in acquiescence 
eugene snow reached across and helped himself to another piece of candy from the box on her knee 
he looked at her speculatively and spoke quietly as if the matter were of no great importance 
would it be agreeable , marian , if the prize committee should announce that there were reasons as to why they were not satisfied , that they have decided to return all plans and call off the present contest opening another in a few months in which interestd parties may again submit their drwings 
i will undertake swiftly and comprehensively to eliminate henry anderson from california 
i would be willing to venture quite a sum that when i finish with the youngstr he will see the beauty of going staight hereafter and the desirability of a change of atmosphere 
he is a youngstr 
i hate to make the matter public , not only on account of involving you and your friends in such disagreeable business , but i am sorry for him 
i would like to deal with him like the proverbial  wouldutch uncle ,  then i would like to send him away to make a new strt with the assurance that i am keeping close watch on him 
would you be satisfied if i handled the matter quietly and in my own way 
could you wait a few weeks for justce 
marian drw a deep breath 
of course , she said , it would be wonderful if you could do that 
what about peter morrison 
how much did he know concerning the plans , and what does he know about this 
nothing , said mr snow 
that mostunusual young friend of yours made me see the light very clearly concerning peter morrison 
there is no necessity for him ever to know that the  wouldram house ,  as miss linda calls it , that he is building for his dram woman has any disagreeable histry attached to it 
he so loves the spot that he is living on it to watch that house in minutestdetail 
miss linda was fairly eloquent in the plea she made on his behalf 
he stikes me as a very unusual person , and she  appealed to me in the same way 
there mustbe some scientific explanation concerning her that i do not justget , but i can see that she is mostunusual when i watched them together and heard them talk of their plans for the house and the grounds and discussing illustations that she is making for articles that he is writing , i saw how deep and wholesome was the friendship existng between them 
i even heard that wonderful serving woman , whom they so familiarly speak of as  katy ,  chiding peter morrison for allowing linda to take her typewriter to him and do her own work with a pen 
because miss linda seems so greathearted and loving with her friends , i was rather glad to hear his explanation that they were merely changing machines for the time being for a very particular reason of their own 
do you mean , asked marian , that you think there is anything more than casual friendship between linda and peter morrison 
not on her part , answered eugene snow 
anybody can see that she is a child deeply engrossed in all sorts of affairs uncommon for a girl of her age and position 
her nice perceptions , her wonderful loyalty to her friends , her loving thought for them , are manifestin everything she says or does 
if she ever makes any mistkes they will be from the head , not from the heart 
for the other end of the equation i could speak authoritatively 
katy pointed out to me the fact that if i would watch peter morrison in miss linda s presence , i should see that he adored her 
i did watch , and i did see that very thing 
when i taxed him about building a dram house for a dram woman , his eyes crossed a plateau , leaped a brook , and strted up the side of a mountain 
they did not restuntil they had found linda 
marian sat so stll that it seemed as if she were not even breathing 
in view of what katy had said , and his few words with peter morrison , eugene snow had felt justfied in giving marian a hint as to what was going on in lilac valley 
exactly what he had done he had no means of knowing 
if he had known and had talked intentionally he could not have made clearer to marian the thing which for months had puzzled her 
she was aware that eugene snow was talking , that he was describing the dinner he had been served , the wonderful wildflower garden that he had seen , how skillfully linda drve the bear cat 
she heard these things and dimly comprehended them but underneath , her brain was seizing upon one fact after another 
they had exchanged typewriters 
the poor , foolish little kid had known how her health was wracked , how she was suffering , how her pride would not let her stop to eileen s subterfuges and wage war with her implements for a man she did not want if her manner of living her everyday life did not appeal to him 
linda had known how lonely and heart hungry and disappointed she had gone away , and loyally she had tried to create an interestin life for her 
she had succeeded entirely too well 
then in a panic she musthave gone to peter morrison and explained the situation 
peter musthave agreed to take over the correspondence 
one by one things that had puzzled her about the letters and about the whole affair began to grow clear 
she even saw how linda , having friendly association with no man save peter , would naturally use him for a model 
the trouble was that , with her gift of penetration and insight and her facility with her pen , she had overdone the matter 
she had not imitated peter 
she had been peter 
marian arose suddenly 
she went home , locked the door , and one after another she read the letters that had piqued , amused , comforted , and finally intrigued her 
they were brilliant letters , charming , appealing letters , and yet , with knowledge concerning them , marian wondered how she could have failed to appreciate in the beginning that they were from linda 
it goes to prove , she said at last how hungry the human heart is for love and sympathy 
that poor kid , what she musthave suffered when she went to peter for help 
if , as mr snow thinks , he cares for her , how he musthave suffered before he agreed to help her , as no doubt he did 
what i have to do is to find some way out of the situation that will relieve linda s anxiety and at leastpartially save my face 
i shall have to take a few days to work it out 
luckily i haven t answered my lastletter 
when i find out what i really want to say then i will be very careful how i say it 
i do not justexactly relish having my letters turned over to peter morrison , but possibly i can think of some wayi mustthink of some wayto make them feel that i have not been any more credulous than they 
while she thought , both linda and peter were doing much thinking on the same subject 
linda s heart was full of gratitude to peter for helping her out of her very disagreeable situation 
peter had not yet opened the packet of letters lying on his table he had a sickening distst for the whole transaction 
he had thought that he would wait until he received the firstletter he was to answer 
if it gave him sufficient foundation in itself for the answer , he would not be forced to search further 
he had smoked many pipes on this decision 
after the visit of mr snow , peter had seen a great light and had decided , from the mood and the attitude of that gentleman after his interview with katy , that he very likely would be equal to any complication that might arise when he reached san francisco 
mulling over the situation one day peter said reflectively to the spring which was very busy talking to him   i am morally certain that this matter has resolved itself into a situation that closely resembles the bootblack s apple    they ain t goin  to be any core 
i am reasonably certain that i never shall have a letter to answer 
in a few days probably i shall be able to turn back that packet to linda without having opened it 
to make up for the perturbation which had resulted in failure in class and two weeks of work that represented her worstappearances in highschool histry , linda , her mind freed from the worry over marian s plans , and her heart calmer over the fiasco in trying to comfort her , devoted herself absorbingly to her lessons and to the next magazine article that she mustfinish 
she had decided that it was time to write on the subject of indian confections 
her firstspare minute she and katy mustbusy themselves working out the mostdelicious cactus candy possible 
they could try the mesquite candy 
no doubt she could evolve a delicious gum from the mesquite and the incense plant 
she knew she could from the willow milkweed 
under the head of sweets an appetizing jelly from manzanita 
there were delightful drnks too , from the manzanita and the chia 
better than either , the lemonade berry would serve this purpose 
she had not experimented to an authoritative extent with the desert pickles 
among drnks she might use the tea made from blueeyed grass , brewed by the indians for feverish conditions 
there was a whole world of interestto open up in differing seeds and berries , parched or boiled for food 
there were the seeds that were ground for mush , like the thiste sage , and the mock orange which was food and soap also , and the wild sunflowers that were parched for meal , and above all , the acorns 
she could see that her problem was not going to be one of difficulty in securing sufficient material for her book 
it would be how to find time to gather all these things , and put them through the various processes and combinations necessary to make edible dishes from i them 
it would mean a long summer of interestng and absorbing i work for her and for katy 
much of it could not be done until the i summer was far advanced and the seeds and the berries were i ripe 
she could rely on donald to help her search for the material 
l with only herself and katy in the family they could give much of their time to the work 
where katy will rebel , said linda to herself , is when it comes to gathering sufficient seeds and parching them to make these meal and mush dishes 
she will call it  fiddlin  business 
she shall be propitiated with a new drss and a beautiful bonnet , and she shall go with me frequently to the fields 
the old dear loves to ride 
firstthing i do i will call at the bank again and have our affairs properly staightened and settled there in the light of the letter daddy left me 
i shall have money to get all the furniture and the rugs and things we truly need 
i will repaint the kitchen and get katy some new cooking utensils to gladden her soul 
saturday i mustmake my trip with donald account for something worth while on the book 
all these plans were feasible 
what linda had to do was to accomplish them , and this she proceeded to do in a swift and businesslike manner 
she soon reached the place where the whole house with the exception of eileen s suite had been gone over , freshened and refurnished to her liking 
the guestoom furniture had been moved to her rejuvenated room 
on the stength of her i returns from the book she had disposed of her furniture and was finding much girlish delight in occupying a beautiful room , daintily decorated , comfortably furnished with pieces of her own selection 
as she and katy stod looking over their work when everything was ready for her firstnight of occupancy katy had said to her  it s jistright and proper , lambie 
it s jistthe way it ought to be 
now say the word and let me clean out eileen s suate and get it ready for miss marian , so if she would drp down unexpected she would find we was good as our word 
all right , said linda 
what am i to do with the stff 
inquired katy 
katy , my dear , said linda with a dr laugh , you will think i am foolish , but i have the queerestfeeling concerning those things 
i can t feel that eileen has done with them 
i can t feel that she will never want them again 
i can t feel that they should go to some secondhand basement 
pack all of her clothing that you can manage in her trunk and put it in the garret , and what the trunk won t hold pack in a tight box and put that in the garret also 
she hasn t written me a line 
she has sent me no addrss 
i do not know what to do 
as i have said before , i am going to save the things at leasta year and see whether some day eileen won t think of something she wants to do with them 
clean the rooms and i will order marian s things sent 
according to these arrangements it was only a few days until linda wrote marian that her room was ready for her and that any time she desired to come and take possession she could testthe lovingness of the welcome that awaited her by becoming intimately acquainted with it 
marian answered the letter immediately 
she said that she was planning to come very soon to testthat welcome 
she longed for the quiet of the valley , for its cool , clean , wild air 
she was very tired 
she needed rest  she thought she would love the new home they were offering her 
came two amazing paragraphs 
the other day dana and i went into one of the big cafes in the city to treat ourselves to a tast of the entertainment with which the people of wealth regale themselves 
we had wandered in laughingly jestng about what we should order , and ran into eileen in the company of her aunt and uncle and a very flashy and loudly drssed young man , evidently a new suitor of eileen s 
i do not think eileen wanted to introduce us , and yet she acted like a person ravenous for news of her home and friends 
she did introduce us , and immediately her ponderous uncle took possession of us 
it seems that the man is a brother of eileen s mother 
linda , he is big and gross , he is everything that a man of nice perceptions would not be , but he does love eileen 
he is trying conscientiously to please her 
his wife is the kind of person who would marry that kind of man and think everything he said and did was right 
the suitor , my dear , was the kind of man who could endure that kind of people 
eileen was almost if not quite , the loveliestthing i ever have seen 
she was plain 
she was simple 
it was the costy simplicity of extravagance 
ye gods 
she had pearls of the size she had always wanted 
she tried with all her might to be herself , but she knows me well enough to know what i would think and what i would write to you concerning the conditions under which i met her 
we were simply forced to lunch with them 
we could only nibble at the too rich , too highly seasoned food set before us 
i noticed that eileen nibbled also 
she is not going to grow fat and waddle and redden her nose , but , my dear , back deep in her eyes and in the curve of her lips and in the tone of her voice there were such disappointment and discontent as i never have seen in any woman 
she could not suppress them 
she could not conceal them 
there was nothing on earth she could do but sit quietly and endure 
they delivered us at our respective offices , leaving both of us dates on which to visit them , but neither of us intends to call on them 
eileen s face was a tragedy when her uncle insistd on making the arrangements 
i can at leastspare her that 
now , my dear , life is growing so full and my time is so taken with my work at the office and with my widening friendships with dana and her friends and with mr snow , that i really feel i have not time to go farther with our anonymous correspondence 
it is all i can do to find time to write you letters such as the one i am writing i have done my bestto play up to what you expected of me and i think i have succeeded in fooling you quite as much as you have felt that you were fooling me 
linda dear , i want you always to know that i appreciate the spirit in which you began this thing 
i know why you did it and i shall always love you a trifle more for your thought of me and your effort to tide over the very dark days you knew i would be facing in san francisco 
i think , dear friend of mine , that i have had my share of dark days 
i think there is very beautiful sunlight  ead for me 
by and by i hope to come into happiness that maybe is even more than my share 
i am coming to see you soon and then i will tell you all about it 
there was more of the letter , but at that point linda made one headlong rush for the bear cat 
she took the curve on two wheels and almostran into the mountain face behind the garage before she could slow down 
she set the cat screaming wildly for peter 
as he came up to the car she leaned toward him , shaking with excitement 
peter , she cried , have you opened that packet of letters yet 
no , said peter , i have not 
give them to me quickly , peter , said linda 
peter rushed into the garage and brought out the packet 
linda caught it in both hands and drpped it in her lap 
well , thank god , she said devoutly 
peter , the joke s on me 
marian knew i was writing those letters all the time and she justpretended that she cared for them to make the game interestng for me 
when she had so many friends and so much to do , she hadn t time for them any longer 
she pretended that she was getting awfully in earnestin order to stp me , and she did stp me all right 
linda s face was a small panorama of conflicting emotions as she appealed to peter 
peter , she said in a quivering voice , you can testfy that she stpped me properly , can t you , peter 
peter tried to smile 
he was older than linda , and he was thinking swiftly , intently 
yes , kid , he said with utmostcorroboration , yes , kid , she stpped you , but i can t see that it was necessary literally to scare the life out of you till she had you at the point where you were thinking of taking off from a mountain or into the sea 
did you really mean that , linda 
linda relaxed suddenly 
she sank back into the deeply padded seat of the bear cat 
a look of fright and entreaty swept into her dark eyes 
yes , peter , i did mean it , she said with finality 
i couldn t have lived if i had hurt marian irreparably 
she has been hurt so much already 
peter , it was awfully nice of you to wait about reading these letters 
even if she only did it for a joke , i think marian would rather that you had not read them 
now i will go back home and begin to work in earneston the head piece of  how to grow good citizens 
i quite agree with you , peter , that the oath of allegiance , citizenship , and the title to a piece of real estte are the prime requisites 
people have no business comma to our country to earn money that they intend to carry away to investin the development and the stengthening of some other country that may some day be our worstenemy 
i have not found out yet how to say it in a fourbytwelveinch stip , but by the time i have read the article aloud to my skylight along about ten tonight i will get an inspiration 
i am sure i shall 
of course you will , said peter 
do not worry about it , dear 
do not lose sleep 
take things slower 
give time for a little more flesh to grow on your bones 
do not forget that while you are helping donald to keep at the head of his classes it s your  firstjob to keep at the head of your own 
thank you , said linda 
how is the dram coming 
beautifully , said peter 
one of these days you are going to come rushing around the boulders and down the side of the building to find all this debris cleared away and the place for a lawn leveled 
i am fighting down every possible avenue of expertise on the building in the effort to save money to make the brook run and the road wind where you have indicated that you want them to follow you 
linda looked at peter while a queer , reflective light gathered in her eyes 
at lastshe said soberly   well , i do not know , peter , that you should make them so very personal to me as all that 
why not 
asked peter casually 
since there is no one else , why not 
linda released the clutch and strted the car 
she backed in front of the garage and turned 
she was stll thinking deeply as she stpped 
once again she extended a hand to peter 
thank you a thousand times for not reading these letters , peter , she said 
i can t express how awfully fine i think it is of you 
if it s all right with you , perhaps there s not any real reason why you should not run that brook and drve that road the way i think they should go 
mebody is going to design them 
why shouldn t i , if it pleases you to have me 
it pleases me very greatly , said petermore than anything else i can think of in all the world at this minute 
then he did a thing that he had done once or twice before 
he bent back linda s fingers and left another kiss in the palm of her hand , and then he closed her fingers very tightly over it 
the middle of the week linda had told katy that she intended stcking up the bear cat for three and that she would take her along on the next saturday s trip to her canyon kitchen 
it was a day upon which she had planned to gather greens , vegetables , and roots , and prepare a dinner wholly from the wild 
she was fairly sure exactly where in nature she would find the materials she wanted , but she knew that the search would be long and tiring 
it would be jolly to have katy to help her prepare the lunch 
it would please katy immensely to be taken 
the original things she said in her quaint irish brogue greatly amused donald 
the arrangement had been understod among them for some time , so they all strted on their journey filled with happy expectations 
they closed the house and the garage carefully 
linda looked over the equipment of the bear cat minutely making sure that her field axe , saw , knives , and her field glasses were in place 
because more food than usual was to be prepared in the kitchen they took along a nestof cooking vessels and a broiler 
they found donald waiting before either of them were ready , and in great glee , with much laughing and many jest they rolled down the valley in the early morning 
they drve to the kitchen , spread their blankets , set up their table , and arranged the small circular opening for their day s occupancy 
while katy and linda were busy with these affairs donald took the axe and collected a big heap of wood 
they left katy to burn the wood and have a deep bed of coals ready while they strted out to collect from the canyon walls , the foot of the mountains , and the nearby desert the materials they would use for their dinner 
justwhere the desert began to climb the mountain linda had for a long time watched a big bed of amole 
donald used the shovel , she the hatchet , and soon they had brought to the surface such a quantity that donald protestd 
i have two uses for them today , explained linda 
they mustserve for potatoes and they have to furnish our meat 
oh , i get you , said donald 
i have always been crazy to try that 
he began to dig again enthusiastcally 
now i will tell you what i think we had better do , said linda 
we will skirmish around this side of the mountain and find a very nice tender yucca shoot 
then we will take these back to katy and let her bury them in the ashes and keep up the fire while we forage for the remainder of our wild indian feast presently they found a yucca head that linda said was exactly right , a delicate pink , thicker than her wristand two feet in length 
with this and the amole they ran back to katy 
she knew how to prepare the amole for roastng 
linda gave her a few words of instuction concerning the yucca 
from the interior of the bear cat she drw a tightly rolled section of wire window screening 
justwhere a deep , wide pool narrowed at a rocky defile they sank the screening , jammed it well to the bottom , fastned it tight at the sides , and againstthe current side of it they threw leaves , grass , chunks of moss , any debris they could gather that would make a temporary dam 
stnding on one side with her field knife , linda began to slice the remainder of the amole very thin and to throw it over the surface of the pool 
on the other , donald pounded the big , juicy bulbs to pulp and scattered it broadcastover the water 
linda instucted katy to sit on the bank with a longhandled landing net and whenever a trout arose , to snatch it out as speedily as possible , being careful not to take more than they would require 
the two youngstrs , exhilarated with youth , with living , with the joy of friendship , with the lure of the valley , with the heady intoxication of the salt breeze and the gold of the sunshine , climbed into the bear cat and went rolling through the canyon and out to the valley on the far side 
here they gathered the tenderestheart shoots of the lupin until linda said they had enough 
to a particular spot that she knew on the desert they hurried for the enlarged stms of the desert trumpet which was to serve that day for an appetizer in the stad of pickles 
here , too , they filled a bucket from the heart of a big bisnaga cactus as a basis for their drnk 
among katherine on wouldonovan s cooking utensils there was a box of delicious cactus candy made from the preserved and sundred heart meat of this same fruit which was to serve as their confection 
on the way back they stpped at the bridge and gathered cress for their salad 
when they returned to katy she had five fine trout lying in the shade , and with more experienced eyes and a more skillful hand linda in a few minutes doubled this number 
they tore out the dam , rinsed the screen and spread it over a rock to dr 
while donald scaled the fish linda put the greens to cook , prepared the salad and set the table 
once , as he worked under her supervision , linda said to donald   now about bread , kidthere s not going to be any bread , because the indians did not have it when they lived the way we are living today 
when you reach the place where your left hand feels empty without a piece of bread in it , justbutter up another amole and try it 
it will serve the same purpose as bread , and be much better for the inner man 
if you would let me skin these fish , said donald , i could do it much fastr and make a better job of it 
you shouldn t skin them 
you want the skin to hold the meat together when it begins to cook tender 
you should be able to peel it off and discard it if it burns or gets smoky in the cooking 
it s a great concession to clean them as we do 
the   indians cooked them in the altogether and ate the meat from the bones 
oh my tummy 
i always thought there was some dark secret about the indians 
linda sat on a rock opposite him and clasped her hands around her knees 
she looked at him meditatively 
did you 
she asked 
suppose you revise that opinion 
our north american indians in their original stte were as fine as any peoples that ever have been discovered the round of the globe 
my grandfather came into intimate contact with them in the early days , and he said that their religion , embracing the idea of a great spirit to whom they were responsible for their deeds here , and a happy hunting ground to which they went as a reward for decent living , was as fine as any religion that ever has been practiced by people of any nation 
immorality was unknown among them 
family ties were formed and they were binding they loved their childrn and reared them carefully 
they were hardy and healthful 
until the introduction of whiskey and what we are pleased to term civilized methods of living , very few of them died save from war or old age 
they were free 
they were happy 
the moping , lazy , diseased creature that you find sleeping in the sun around the reservations is a product of our civilization 
nice commentary on civilization , isn t it 
for heaven s sake , linda , said donald , do not strt any big brainstrming trains of thought today 
grant me repose 
i have overworked my brain for a few months pastuntil i know only one thing for certain 
all right then , me lad , this is the time for the big secret , said linda 
i justhappened to be in the assembly room on some business of my own lastthursday afternoon when my sessions were over , and i overheard your professor in trigonometry tell a marl i did not know , who seemed to be a friend visiting him , that the son of judge whiting was doing the finestwork that ever had been done in any of the los angeles high schools , and that undoubtedly you were going to graduate with higher honors than any other boy ever had from that school 
donald sat thinking this over 
he absently lifted an elbow and wiped the tiny scales from his face with his shirt sleeve 
young woman , he said solemnly , them things what you are saying , are they  cross your heart , honestto goodness , so help you ,  truth , or are they the fruit of a perfervid imagination 
linda shook her head vigorously 
de but  , kid , she said , de gospel but  
you have the jp going properly 
he can t stp you now 
you have fought your good fight , and you have practically won it 
all you have to do is to carry on till the middle of june , and you are it 
i wish dad knew , said donald in a low voice 
the judge does know , said linda heartily 
it wasn t fifteen minutes after i heard that till i had him on the telephone repeating it as fastas i could repeat 
come to think of it , haven t you noticed a particularly cocky set of his head and the corksome lightness about his heels during the pastfew days 
by jove , he has been happy about something 
i noticed that louise and the mater were sort of cheery and making a specialty of the only son and brother 
sure , brother , sure , said linda 
hurry up and scrape those fish and let s scamper down the canyon merely for the joy of flying with wings on our feet 
you are it , young man , justit 
donald was sitting on a boulder 
on another in front of him he was operating on the trout 
his hands were soiled 
his hair was tousled 
he was fairly well decorated with fine scales 
he looked at linda appealingly 
am i  it  with you , linda 
he asked soberly 
sure you are , said linda 
you are the bestfriend i have 
will you write to me when i go to college this fall 
why , you couldn t keep me from it , said linda 
i will have  so many things to tell you 
when your firstvacation comes we will make it a hummer 
i know dad won t let me come home for my holidays except for the midsummer ones , said donald soberly 
it would take mostof the time there would be of the short holidays to travel back and forth 
you will have to go very carefully about getting a strt , said linda , and you should be careful to find the right kind of friends at the very strt 
christas and thanksgiving boxes can always be sent on time to reach you 
it won t be so long for you as for us 
by the time you have oka sayye beaten to ravelings you will have such a  perfect habit  that you will strt right in with the beating idea 
that should keep you fairly busy , because mostof the men you come up againstwill be beaters themselves 
yes , i know , said donald 
are you going to strt me to college with the idea that i have to keep up this beating habit 
if i were to be one of fifty or a hundrd , wouldn t that be good enough 
why , sure , said linda , if you will be satisfied with having me like fifty or a hundrd as well as i do you 
oh , damn 
do i have to keep up this topcrustbusiness all my days 
linda looked at him with a queer smile on her lips 
not unless you want to , donald , she said quietly 
not unless you think you would rather 
donald scraped a fish vigorously 
linda sat watching him 
presently the tense lines around his eyes vanished 
a faint red crept up his neck and settled on his left cheek bone 
a confused grin slowly widened his naturally wide mouth 
it s me for the top crust he said conclusively 
it s me for you , answered linda in equally as matteroffact tones 
rising , she gathered up the fish and carried them to katy while donald knelt beside the chilly steam and scoured his face and hands , after which linda whipped away the scales with an improvised brush of willow twigs 
it was such a wonderful day 
it was such an unusual and delicious feast  plump brook trout , fresh from icy water , delicately broiled over searing wood coals , are the finestof food 
through the meal to the point where donald lay on his back at the far curve of the canyon wall , nibbling a piece of cactus candy , everything had been perfect 
nine months would be a long time to be gone , but linda would wait for him , and she would write to him 
he raised his head on his elbow and called across to her   say , linda , how often will you write to me 
linda answered promptly   every saturday night 
saturday is our day 
i will tell you what has happened all the week 
i will tell you specially what a darned unprofitable day saturday is when you are three thousand miles away 
bending over the canyon fireplace , her face red with heat and exertion , katherine on wouldonovan caught up her poker and beat up the fire until the ashes flew 
easy , katy , easy , cautioned linda 
we may want to bury those coals and resurrect them to warm up what is left for supper 
we will do no such thing , said katy promptly 
what remains goes to feed the fish 
next time it s hungry ye are , we are goin  to hit it staight to lilac valley and fill ourselves with god s own bread and beefstak and paraties 
do not ye think we are goin  to be atin  these haythen messes twice in one day 
to herself she was saying   the sooner i get you home to pater morrison , missy , the better i will be satisfied 
once she stod erect , her hands at her belt , her elbows widespread , and with narrowed eyes watched the youngstrs 
her lips were closed so tightly they wrinkled curiously as she turned back to the fireplace 
nayther one of them fool kids has come to yet , she said to herself , and a mighty good thing it is that they haven t 
linda was looking speculatively at donald as he lay stetched  on the indian blanket at the base of the cliff 
then , because she was for ever busy with nature , her eyes stayed above him up the side of the cliff , noting the vegetation , the scarred rocks , the sheer beauty of the canyon wall until they reached the top 
for no reason at all , she sat looking stadily at a huge boulder overhanging the edge of the cliff , and she was wondering how many ages it had hung there and how many more it would hang , poised almostin air , when a tiny pebble at its base loosened and came rattling and bounding down the canyon face 
every nerve in linda tensed 
she opened her mouth , but not a sound came 
for a breathless second she was paralyzed 
she shrieked wildly   donald , donald , roll under the ledge 
quick , quick 
she turned to katy 
back , katy , back 
she screamed 
that boulder is loose 
it s coming down 
for months donald whiting had obeyed linda implicitly and instntly 
he had moved with almostinvisible speed at her warning many times before 
metimes it had been a venomous snake , sometimes a yucca bayonet , sometimes poison vines , again unsafe footingin each case instnt obedience had been the rule 
he did hot queston why at her warning 
he instntly did as he was told 
he , too , had noticed the falling pebble 
with all the agility of which he was capable he rolled under the narrow projecting ledge above him 
katherine on wouldonovan was a good soldier also 
she whirled and ran to the roadway 
she had barely reached it when , with a grinding crash , down came the huge boulder , carrying bushes , smaller rocks , sand , and debris with it 
on account of its weight it fell staight , stuck heavily , and buried itself in the earth exactly on the spot upon which donald had been lying 
linda raised terrified eyes to the top of the wall 
for one instnt a dark object peered over it and then drw back 
without thought for herself linda rushed to the boulder , and kneeling , tried to see back of it 
donald 
she cried , donald , are you all right 
guess i am , unless it hit one foot pretty hard 
feels fast can you get out 
she cried , beginning to tear with her hands at the stne and the bushes where she thought his head would be 
i am fast but i am all right , he panted 
why the devil did that thing hang there for ages , and then come down on me today 
yes , why did it 
gasped linda 
donald , i mustleave you a minute 
i have got to know if i saw a head peer over justas that stne came down 
be careful what you do 
he cried after her 
linda sprang to her feet and rushed to the car 
she caught out the field classes and threw the stap over her head as she raced to the far side of the fireplace where the walls were not so sheer 
katherine on wouldonovan promptly seized the axe , caught its carrying stap lying beside it , thrustthe handle through , swung it over her own head , drpped it between her shoulders , and ripping off her drss skirt she strted up the cliff after linda 
linda was climbing so swiftly and so absorbedly that she reached the top before she heard a sound behind her 
she turned with a white face , and her mouth drpped open as she saw katy three fourths of the way up the cliff 
for one second she was again stff with terror , then , feeling she could do nothing , she stpped back out of sight and waited a second until katy s red head and redder face appeared over the edge 
realizing that her authority was of no avail , that katy would follow her no matter where she went or what she did , and with no time to argue , linda simply called to her encouragingly   follow where i go 
take your time 
hang tight , old dear , it s dangerous 
she strted around the side of the mountain , heading almoststaight upward , traveling as swiftly and as noiselessly as possible 
over big boulders , on precarious footing , clinging to bushes , they made their way until they reached a place that seemed to be sheer above them 
certainly it was for hundrds of feet below on a point of rock screened by overhanging bushes linda paused until katy overtook her 
we are about stlled , she panted 
find a good footing and sty where you are 
i am going to climb out on these bushes and see if i can get a view of the mountain side 
advancing a few yards , linda braced herself , drw around her glasses , and began searching the side of the mountain opposite her and below as far as she could range with the glasses 
at lastshe gave up 
musthave gone the other way , she said to katy 
i will crawl back to you 
we will go after help and get donald out 
there will be time enough to examine the cliff afterward 
i am justas sure now as i will be when it is examined that that stne was purposely loosened to a degree where a slight push would drp it 
as donald says , there s no reason why it should hang there for centuries and fall on him today 
shut your eyes , old dear , and back up 
we mustgo to donald 
i rather think it s on one of his feet from what he said 
let me take one more good look 
at that minute from high on the mountain above them a shower of sand and pebbles came rattling down 
linda gave katy one terrified look 
my god 
she panted 
he is coming down right above us 
justhow linda recrossed the bushes and reached katy she did not know 
she motioned for her to make her way back as they had come 
katy planted her feet squarely upon the rock 
her lower jaw shot out 
her eyes were aflame 
she stod perfectly stll with the exception of motioning linda to crowd back under the bushes , and again linda realized that she had no authority 
as she had done from childhood when katy was in earnest linda obeyed her 
she had barely reached the overhanging bushes , crouched under them , and staightened herself , when a small avalanche came showering down , and a minute later a pair of feet were level with her head 
screened by the bushes , she could have reached out and touched oka sayye 
as his feet found a solid restng place on the ledge on which linda and katy stod , and while he was stll clinging to the bushes , katherine on wouldonovan advanced upon him 
he had felt that his feet were firm , let go his hold , and turned , when he faced the infuriated irishwoman 
she had pulled the stap from around her neck , slipped the axe from it , and with a stong thrustshe planted the head of it againstoka sayye s chestso hard that she almostfell forward 
the jp plunged backward among the bushes , the roots of which had supported linda while she used the glasses 
he fell , sliding among them , snatching wildly 
linda gripped the overhanging growth behind which she had been screened , and leaned forward 
he has a hold 
he is coming back up , katy 
she cried 
katy took another stp forward 
she looked over the cliff down an appalling depth of hundrds of feet 
deliberately she raised the axe , circled it round her head and brought it down upon that particular branch to which oka sayye was clinging 
she cut it through , and the axe rang upon the stne wall behind it 
as she swayed forward linda reached out , gripped katy and pulled her back 
get him 
she asked tersely , as if she were speaking of a rat or a rattlesnake 
katy sank back limply againstthe wall 
linda slowly turned her around , and as she faced the rock , squeeze tight againstit shut your eyes , and keep a stff upper lip , she cautioned 
i am going to work around you 
i want to be  ead of you 
she squeezed pastkaty , secured the axe and hung it round her own neck 
she cautioned katy to keep her eyes shut and follow where she led her , then they strted on their way back 
linda did not attempt to descend the sheer wall by which they had climbed , but making a detour she went lower , and in a very short time they were back in the kitchen 
linda rushed to the boulder and knelt again , but she could get no response to her questons 
evidently donald s foot was caught and he was unconscious from the pain 
squeezing as close as she could , she thrusther arm under the ledge until she could feel his head 
she went to the other side , and there she could see that his right foot was pinned under the rock 
she looked at katy reassuringly , then she took off the axe and handed it to her 
he is alive , she said 
can t kill a healthy youngstr to have a crushed foot 
you stnd guard until i take the bear cat and bring help 
it s not far to where i can find people 
at full speed linda put the cat through the steam and out of the canyon until she reached cultivated land , where she found a man who would gather other men and strt to the rescue 
she ran on until she found a house with a telephone 
there she called judge whiting , telling him to bring an ambulance and a surgeon , giving him explicit directions as to where to come , and assuring him that donald could not possibly be seriously hurt 
she found time to urge , also , that before strting he set in motion any precautions he had taken for donald s protection 
she told him where she thought what remained of oka sayye could be found 
then , as naturally and as methodically as she had done all the rest she called peter morrison and told him that she was in trouble and where he could find her 
because peter had many miles less distnce to travel than the others she had summoned , he arrived first  he found linda and katy had burrowed under the stne until they had made an opening into which the broken foot might sink so that the pain of the pressure would be relieved 
before the rock , with picks and shovels , half a dozen sympathetic farmers from ranches and cultivated land at the mouth of the canyon were digging furiously to make an opening undermining the boulder so that it could be easily tipped forward 
donald was conscious and they had been passing water to him and encouraging him with the report that his father and a good surgeon would be there very soon 
katherine on wouldonovan had crouched at one side of the boulder , supporting the hurt foot 
she was breathing heavily and her usually red face was a ghasty green 
linda had helped her to resume the skirt of her drss 
at the other side of the rock the girl was reaching to where she could touch donald s head or reassuringly grip the hand that he could extend to her 
peter seized linda s axe and began hewing at the earth and rock in order to help in the speedy removal of the huge boulder 
on judge whiting , accompanied by doctor fleming , the city s greatestsurgeon , came caring into the canyon and stpped on the roadway when he saw  the party 
the judge sprang from the car , leaped the steam , and  strted toward them 
in an effort to free his son before his arrival , all the men braced themselves againstthe face of the cliff and pushed with their combined stength 
the boulder drpped forward into the trench they had dug for it enough to allow peter to crowd his body between it and the cliff and lift donald s head and shoulders 
linda instntly ran around the boulder , pushed her way in , and carefully lifting donald s feet , she managed to work the lithe slenderness of her body through the opening , so that they carried donald out and laid him down in the open 
he was considerably dazed and shaken , cruelly hurt , but proved himself a game youngstr of the right mettle 
he raised himself to a sitting postre , managing a rather stfflipped smile for his father and linda 
the surgeon instntly began cutting to reach the hurt foot , while peter morrison supported the boy s head and shoulders on one side , his father on the other 
an exclamation of dismay broke from the surgeon s lips 
he looked at judge whiting and nodded slightly 
the men immediately picked up donald and carried him to the ambulance 
katherine on wouldonovan sat down suddenly and buried her face in the skirt of her drss 
linda laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder 
do not , katy , she said 
keep up your nerve 
you are all right , old dear 
donald s fine 
that doesn t mean anything except that his foot is broken , so he won t be able , and it won t be necessary for him , to endure the pain of setting it in a castwithout an anestetic 
doctor fleming can work much better where he has every convenience 
it s all right 
the surgeon climbed into the ambulance and they strted on an emergency run to the hospital 
as the car turned and swept down the canyon , for no reason that she could have explained , linda began to shake until her teeth clicked 
peter morrison sprang back across the brook , and running to her side , he put his arm around her and with one hand he pressed her head againsthis shoulder , covering her face 
stady , linda , he said quietly , stady 
you know that he is all right 
it will only be a queston of a short confinement 
linda made a brave effort to control herself 
she leaned againstpeter and held out both her hands 
i am all right , she chattered 
give me a minute 
judge whiting came to them 
i am getting away immediately , he said 
i mustreach louise and mother before they get word of this 
doctor fleming will take care of donald all right 
what happened , linda 
can you tell me 
linda opened her lips and tried to speak , but she was too breathless , too full of excitement , to be coherent 
to her amazement katherine on wouldonovan scrambled to her feet , lifted her head and faced the judge 
she pointed to the fireplace 
i was right there , busy with me cookie  utensils , she said l miss linda was asittin , on that exact spot , they jisthavin 1 finished atin  some of her haythen messes 
the lad was lyin , square where the boulder stuck , on the indian blanket , atin  a pace of cactus candy 
jistone pebble came rattlin  down , but miss linda happened to be lookin  , and she scramed to the b y to be rollin  under where ye found him 
he gave a flop or two , and it s well that he took his orders without waitin  to ask the raison for them , for if he had , at the prisint minute he would be about as thick as a shate of writing paper 
the thing drpped clear and staight and drve itself into the earth and stne below it , as ye see 
katherine on wouldonovan paused 
yes , said the judge 
anything else 
miss linda got to him and she made sure he had brathin  space and he wasn t hurt bad , and then she told him he had got to stnd it , because , sittin  where she did , she faced the cliff and she thought she had seen someone 
she took the telescope and strted climbin  , and i took the axe and i strted climbin  after her 
katy broke down and emitted a weird irish howl 
linda instntly braced herself , threw her arms around katy , and drw her head to her shoulder 
she looked at judge whiting and began to talk i can show you where she followed me , staight up the face of the canyon , almost she said 
she never had tried to climb a canyon side for a yard , either , but she came up and over after me , like a cat 
up there on a small ledge oka sayye came down directly above us 
i couldn t be mistken 
i saw him plainly 
i know him by sight as well as i do any of you 
we heard the stnes coming down before him , and we knew someone was going to be on us who was desperate enough to kill 
when he touched our level and turned to follow the ledge we were on , i pushed him over 
katy shook off linda s protecting arm and staightened suddenly 
why , ye domned little fool , ye 
she screamed 
ye never told a lie before in all your days 
judge whiting , i had the axe round me neck by the climbin  stap , and i got it in me fingers when we heard the crature comin  , and againsthis chisti set it , and i gave him a shove that sint him over 
like a cat he was aclingin  and climbin  , and when i saw him comin  up on us with that awful face of his , i jistswung the axe like i do when i am rejoocin  a pace of eucalyptus to fireplace size , and whack 
i took the branch supportin  him , and a dome  good axe i spoiled din  it 
katy folded her arms , lifted her chin higher than it ever had been before , and glared defiance at the judge 
now go on , she said , and decide what ye will do to me for it 
the judge reached over and took both katherine on wouldonovan s hands in a firm grip 
you brave woman 
he said 
if it lay in my power , i would give you the carnegie medal 
in any event i will see that you have a good bungalow with plenty of shamrck on each side of your front path , and a fair income to keep you comfortable when the rheumatic days are upon you 
i am no overfeeder , said katy proudly 
i am daily exercisin  me muscles enough to kape them young 
the rheumatism i will not have 
nayther will i have the house nor the income 
i have saved me money 
i have an income of me own 
as for the bungalow , interrupted linda , katherine , as i have mentioned frequently before is my father , and my mother , and my whole family , and her front door is mine 
sure , said katy proudly 
when these two fine people before you set up their hearthstne , aswapin  it i will be , and carin  for their youngstrs 
judge , i would like a bit of the shamrck 
ye might be sendin  me a strt of that , if it would plase your honor 
judge whiting looked intently at katherine on wouldonovan 
then , as if they had been on the witness stnd , he looked searchingly at linda 
linda was too perturbed , too accustmed to katy s extravagant nonsense even to notice the purport of what she had said 
the judge turned his attention to peter morrison and realized that at leastone of the parties to katherine s proposed hearthstne had understod and heartily endorsed her proposal 
i will have to be going 
the boy and his mother will need me , he said 
i will see all of you later 
he sprang across the brook and sent his car roaring down the canyon after the ambulance 
once more katy sank to the ground 
linda looked at her as she buried her face and began to wail 
peter , she said quietly , hunt our belongings and pack them in the bear cat the bestyou can 
excuse us for a few minutes 
we mustact this out of our systms 
gravely she sat down beside katy , laid her head on her shoulder , and began to cry very nearly as energetically as katy herself 
that was the one thing which was mosteffective in restring katy s nerves 
tears were such an unaccustmed thing with linda that katy controlled herself speedily so that she might be better able to serve the girl 
in a few minutes katy had reduced her emotions to a dr sniffle 
she lifted her head , groped for her pocket , and being unable to find it for the very good reason that she was sitting upon it , she used her gingham hem as a handkerchief 
once she had risen to the physical effort of wiping her eyes , she regained calmness rapidly 
the lasttime she applied the hem she looked at peter , but addrssed the almighty in resigned tones   there , lord , i guess that will do 
in a few minutes she was searching the kitchen , making sure that no knives , spoons , or cooking utensils were lost  missing her support , linda sat erect and endeavored to follow katy s example 
her eyes met peter s and when she saw that his shoulders were shaking , a dr , hystrical laugh possessed her 
yes , katy , she panted , that will do , and remember the tears we are shedding are over donald s broken foot , and because this may interfere with his work , though i do not think it will for long 
when i cry , said katy tersely , i cry because i feel like it 
i wasn t wapin  over the snake that would plan a death like that for anyonekaty waved toward the boulderand nayther was i wastn  me tears over the fut of a kid bein  jommed up a trifle 
well , then , katy , asked linda tremulously , why were you crying 
well , there s times , said katy judicially , when me spirits tell me i would be the better for lettin  off a wee bit of stme , and one of them times havin  arrived , i jistbowed me head to it , as is in accordance with the makings of me 
far be it from me to be flyin  in the face of providence and sayin  i won t , when all me interior disposhion says to me    ye will 
now , linda , said peter , can you tell us why you were crying 
why , i think , said linda , that katy has explained sufficiently for both of us 
it was merely time for us to howl after such fearful nerve stain , so we howled 
well , that s all right , said peter 
now i will tell you something 
if you had gone away in that ambulance to an anestetic and an operation , no wildcat that ever indulged in a hunger hunt through this canyon could have put up a howl equal to the one that i would have sent up 
peter , said linda , there is nothing funny about this 
it s no tame for jest  but do men have nerves 
would you really 
of course i would , said peter 
no , you wouldn t , contradicted linda 
you justsay that because you want to comfort us for having broken down , instad of trying to tease us as mostmen would 
he would , too 
now come on 
let s go home and be gettin  craned up and ready for what s goin  to happen to us 
will they be jailin  us , belike , miss linda 
linda looked at peter questoningly 
no , he said quietly 
it is very probable that the matter never will be mentioned to you again , unless judge whiting gets hold of some clue that he wishes to use as an argument againstmatured jps being admitted in the same highschool classes  with our clean , decent , young americans 
they stpped that in the grades several years ago , i am told 
before they could strt back to lilac valley a car stpped in the canyon and a couple of men introducing themselves as having come from judge whiting interviewed katy and linda exhaustvely 
linda pointed out to them an easier but much longer route by which they might reach the top of the canyon to examine the spot from which the boulder had fallen 
she showed them where she and katy had ascended , and told them where they would be likely to find oka sayye 
when it came to a queston of really strting , linda looked with appealing eyes at peter 
peter , she said , could we fix it any way so you could drve katy and me home 
for the firsttime since i have begun drving this spring i do not feel equal to keeping the road 
of course , said peter 
i will take your car to the nearestfarmhouse and leave it , then i will take you and katy in my car 
late that evening judge whiting came to lilac valley with his wife and daughter to tell linda that the top of the cliff gave every evidence of the stne having been loosened previously , so that a slight impetus would send it crashing down at the time when donald lay in his accustmed place directly in the line of its fall 
his detectives had found the location of the encounter and they had gone to the bottom of the cliff , a thousand feet below , but they had not been able to find any trace of oka sayye 
mewhere in waiting there had been confederates who had removed what remained of him 
on the way home mr 
whiting said to her husband   judge , are you very sure that what the cook said to you this afternoon about miss stong and mr morrison is true 
i am only sure of its truth so far as he is concerned , replied the judge 
what he thought about linda was evident 
i am very sorry 
she is a mighty fine girl and i think donald is very much interestd in her 
yes , i think so , too , said donald s mother 
interestd 
he has not even a case of firstlove 
he is interestd for the same  reason you would be or i would be , because she is intellectually so stmulating 
you have to take into consideration the fact that in two or three years more she will be ready for marriage and a home of her own , and donald will stll be in school with his worldly experience and his business education not yet begun 
the bestthing that can happen to donald is justto let his infatuation for her die a natural death , with the quiet assistnce of his family 
the judge s face reddened slightly 
well , i would like mighty well to have her in the family , he said 
she is a corking fine girl 
she would make a fine mother of fine men 
i haven t a doubt but that with the power of his personality and the power of his pen and the lure of propinquity , peter morrison will win her , but i hate it 
it s the bestchance the boy ever will have 
then louise spoke up softly 
donald hasn t any chance , dad , she said quietly , and he never did have 
i have met peter morrison myself and i would be only too glad if i thought he was devoted to me 
i will grant that linda stong is a fine girl , but when she wakes up to the worth of peter morrison and to a realization of what other women would be glad to be to him , she will merely reach out and lay possessive hands upon what already belongs to her 
it was a curious thing that such occurrences as the death of oka sayye and the injury to donald could take place and no one know about them 
yet the papers were silent on the subject and so were the courts 
linda and katy were fully protected 
the confederates of oka sayye for reasons of their own preferred to keep very quiet 
by monday donald , with his foot in a plastr cast was on a side veranda of his home with a table beside him stewn with books and papers 
an agreement had been made that his professors should call and hear his recitations for a few days until by the aid of a crutch and a cane he could resume his place in school 
linda went to visit him exactly as she would have gone to see  marian in like circumstnces 
she succeeded in making all of the whiting family her very devoted friends 
one evening , after he had been hobbling about for over a week , linda and peter called to spend the evening , and a very gay and enjoyable evening it was 
yet when it was over and they had gone away together donald appeared worried and deeply thoughtful 
when his mother came to his room to see if the foot was unduly painful or there was anything she could do to make him more comfortable , he looked at her belligerently 
mother , he said , i do not like peter morrison being so much with my girl 
mr 
whiting stod very stll 
she thought very fast  should she postone it or should she let the boy take all of his hurts together 
her heart ached for him and yet she felt that she knew what life had in stre for him concerning linda 
she sat on the edge of the bed and began to talk quietly , plainly , reasonably 
she tried to explain nature and human nature and what she thought the laws of probability were in the case 
donald lay silent 
he said nothing until she had finished all she had to say , and then he announced triumphantly   you are all wrong 
that is what would happen if linda were a girl like any of the other girls in her class , or like louise 
she has promised that she would write to me every saturday night and she has said that she thinks more of me than of any of the other boys 
donald dear , said mr 
whiting , you are not ing love  with linda yourself , and neither is she with you 
by the time you are ready to marry and settle down in life , linda in all probability will be married and be the mother of two or three babies 
yes , like fun she will , said donald roughly 
have you asked her whether she loves you 
inquired mr 
whiting 
oh , that  love  business , said donald , it makes me tired 
linda and i never did any mushing around 
we had things of some importance to talk about and to do 
a bit of pain in mr 
whiting s heart eased 
it was difficult to keep her lips quiet and even 
you haven t asked her to marry you , then 
she said soberly 
oh good lord , cried donald ,  marry 
how could i marry anyone when i haven t even graduated from high school and with college and all that to come 
that is what i have been trying to tell you , said his mother evenly 
i do not believe you have been thinking about marriage and i am absolutely certain that linda has not , but she is going to be made to think about it long before you will be in such financial position that you dare 
that is the reason i am suggestng that you think about these things seriously and queston yourself as to whether you would be doing the fair thing by linda if you tried to tie her up in an arrangement that would ask her to wait six or eight years yet before you would be ready 
well , i can get around fastr than that , said donald belligerently 
of course you can , agreed his mother 
i made that estmate fully a year too long 
even in seven years linda could do an awful lot of waiting 
there are some very wonderful girls that will be coming up six or seven years from now here at home 
you know that hereafter all the girls in the world are going to be very much more linda s kind of girls than they have been heretofore 
the girls who have lived through the war and who have been intimate with its sorrow and its suffering and its terrible results to humanity , are not going to be such heedless , thoughtless , not nearly such selfish , girls as the world has known in the decade justpast  and there is going to be more outdoor life , more nature stdy 
there are going to be stonger bodies , better food , bettercaredfor young people 
every year educational advantages are going to be greater 
if you can bring yourself to think about giving up the idea of there ever existng any extremely personal thing between you and linda , i am very sure i could guarantee to introduce you to a girl who would be quite her counterpart , and undoubtedly we could meet one who would be handsomer 
donald punched his pillow viciously 
that s nice talk , he said , and it may be true talk 
in the firstplace i wish that peter morrison would let my girl alone , and in the second place i do not care if there are a thousand justas nice girls or even betterlooking girls than linda , though any girl would be going some if she were nicer and better looking than linda 
i am telling you that when my foot gets better i am going to lilac valley and tell him where to head in , and i will punch his head if he doesn t do it promptly 
of course you will , said his mother reassuringly 
i will go with you and we will see to it that he attends stictly to his own affairs 
donald burstout laughing , exactly as his mother in her heart had hoped that he would 
yes , i have got a handpainted picture of myself strting to lilac valley to fight a man who is butting in with my girl , and taking my mother along to help me beat him up , he said 
mr 
whiting put her arms around her boy , kissed him tenderly , and smoothed his hair , and then turned out the lights and slipped from the room 
in the clear moonlight as she closed the door she could see that a boyish grin was twistng his lips , and she went down to tell the judge that he need not worry 
if his boy were irreparably hurt anywhere , it was in his foot 
the following weeks were very happy for linda 
when the castwas removed from donald s foot and it was found that a year or two of care would put him even on the athletic fields and the dancing floor again , she was greatly relieved 
she lacked words in which to express her joy that marian was rapidly coming into happiness 
she was so very busy with her school work , with doing all she could to help donald with his , with her jane meredith articles , with hunting and working out material for her book , that she never had many minutes at a time for introspection 
when she did have a few she sometimes pondered deeply as to whether marian had been altogether sincere in the lastletter she had written her in their correspondence , but she was so delighted in the outcome that if she did at times have the same doubt in a fleeting form that had not been in the leastfleeting with peter morrison , she dismissed it as rapidly as possible 
when things were so very good as they were at that time , why try to improve them 
one evening as she came from school , thinking that she would take katy for a short run in the bear cat before dinner , she noticed a red head prominent in the front yard as she neared home 
when she turned in at the front walk and crossed the lawn she would have been willing to wager quite a sum that katy had been crying 
why , old dear , said linda , putting her arms around her , if anything has gone wrong with you i will certainly take to the warpath , instnter 
i can t even imagine what could be troubling you 
linda lowered her voice 
nothing has come up about oka sayye 
katy shook her head 
i thought not , said linda 
judge whiting promised me that what use he made of that should be man s business and exploited wholly for the sake of california and her people 
he said we shouldn t be involved 
i haven t been worried about it even , although i am willing to go upon the stnd and tell the whole stry if it will be any help toward putting right what is at present a great wrong to california 
yes , so would i , said katy 
i am not worryin  meself about the little bast any more than i would if it had been a mad dog foaming up that cliff at ye 
what is it 
asked linda 
tell me this minute 
i dunno what in the world you are going to think , said katy i dunno what in the world you are going to do 
her face was so distessed that linda s nimble brain flew to a conclusion 
she tightened her arm across katy s shoulder 
by jove , katy 
she said breathlessly 
is eileen in the house 
katy nodded 
has she been to see john and made things right with him 
katy nodded again 
he is in there with her waitin  for ye , she said 
it was a stnned linda who slowly drpped her arm , stod erect , and lifted her head very high 
she thought intently 
you do not mean to tell me , she said , that you have been crying over her 
katy held out both hands 
linda , she said , she always was such a pretty thing , and her ma did not raise her to have the sense of a peewee 
if your pa had been let take her outdoors and grow her in the sun and the air , she would have been bigger and broader , an  there would have been the truth of god s sunshine an  the glory of his rain about her 
ye know , linda , that she did not ever have a common decent chance 
it was curls that couldn t be shook out and a nose that dassen t be sunburned and shoes that must t be scuffed and a drss that shouldn t be mussed , from the day she was born 
ye couldn t jisthonestsay she had ever had a fair chance , now could ye 
no , said linda conclusively  no , katherine on wouldonovan , you could not 
what are we up against  does she want to come back 
does she want to sty here again 
i think she would like to , said katy 
you go in and see her for yourself , lambie , before ye come to any decision 
you do not mean , said linda in a marveling tone , that she has been homesick , that she has come back to us because she would like to be with us again 
you go and see her for yourself 
if you do not say she is the worstbeat out and the tiredestmortal that ye have ever seen you will be surprisin  me 
my god , linda , they ain t nothin  in bein  rich if it can do to a girl what has been done to eileen 
oh , well , said linda impatiently , do not condemn all money because eileen has not found happiness with it 
the trouble has been that eileen s only chance to be rich came to her through the wrong kind of people 
well , will ye jisttell me , then , said katy , how it happened that eileen s ma was a sistr to that great beef of a man , which same is hard on selfrayspectin  beef 
pork would come nearer 
yes , said linda , i will tell you 
eileen s mother had a big steak of the same coarseness and the same vulgarity in her nature , or she could not have reared eileen as she did 
she probably had been sent to school and had better advantages than the boy through a designing mother of her own 
her firsthusband musthave been a man who greatly refined and educated her 
we can t ever get away from the fact that daddy believed in her and loved her 
yes , said katy , but he was a fooled man 
she wasn t what we thought she was 
many s the time i have stod injustce about the accounts and household management because i wouldn t be wakin  him up to what he was bound to for life 
that doesn t help us , said linda 
i mustgo in and face them 
she handed her books to katy , and went into the living room she concentrated on john gilman first and a wee qualm of disgustcrept through her soul when she saw that after weeks of suffering he was once more ready to devote himself to eileen 
linda marveled at the power a woman could hold over a man that would force him to compromise with his intellect , his education and environment 
she turned her attention to eileen , and the shock she received was informing 
she stdied her an instnt incredulously , then she went to her and held out her hand 
how do you do 
she said as cordially as was possible to her 
this is unexpected 
her mind was working rapidly , yet she could not recall ever having seen a woman quite so beautiful as eileen 
she was very certain that the color on her cheeks was ebbing and rising with excitement 
it was no longer so deep as to be sttionary 
she was very certain that her eyes had not been darkened as to lids or waxed as to lashes 
her hair was beautifully drssed in sweeping waves with scarcely any artificial work upon it 
her drss was extremely tastful and very expensive 
there was no simper on her lips , nothing superficial 
she was only a tired , homesick girl 
as linda looked at her she understod why katy had cried over her 
she felt tears beginning to rise in her own heart 
she put both arms protectingly around eileen 
why , you poor little thing , she said wonderingly , was it so damn  bad as all that 
eileen stod staight 
she held herself rigidly 
she merely nodded 
after a second she said   worse than anything you could imagine , linda 
being rich with people who have grown rich by accident is a dradful experience 
i have always imagined , said linda 
then in her usual downright way she asked   why did you come , eileen 
is there anything you wanted of me 
eileen hesitated 
it was not in linda s heart to be mean 
homesick , little sistr 
she asked lightly do you want to come here while you are getting ready to make a home for john 
is that it 
eileen swayed forward suddenly , buried her face in linda s breast and for the firsttime in her life linda saw and heard her cry , not from selfishness , not from anger , not from greed , but as an ordinary human being cries when the heart is so full that nature relieves itself with tears 
linda closed her arms around her and smiled over her head at john gilman 
finish all of it before you stp , she advised 
it s all right 
you come staight home 
you did not leave me any word , and i did not know what to do with your things , but i couldn t feel that you would want to give up such beautiful things that you had so enjoyed 
we had planned for marian to spend her summer vacation here so i put her things in your suite and i had moved mine into the guestroom , but i have had my room done over and the guestroom things are in there , and every scrap of yours is carefully put away 
if that will do , you are perfectly welcome to it 
eileen wiped her eyes 
anything , she sobbed 
i would rather have katy s room than be shamed and humiliated and hurt any further 
linda , i would almostlike you to know my aunt callie , because you will never understnd about her if you do not 
her favorite pastme was to tell everyone we met how much the things i wore costher 
linda released eileen with a slight shake 
cheer up  
she said 
we will all have a gorgeous time together 
i haven t the slightestambition to know more than that about your aunt callie 
if my brain really had been acting properly i would never have dismantled your room 
i would have known that you could not endure her , and that you would come home justas you should 
it s all right , john , make yourself comfortable 
i do not know what katy has for dinner but she can always find enough for an extra couple 
come eileen , i will help you to settle 
where is your luggage 
i brought back , linda , justwhat i have on , said eileen 
i will begin again where i left off 
i realize that i am not entitled to anything further from the stong estte , but uncle was so unhappy and john says it s all rightreally i am the only blood heir to all they have 
i might as well take a comfortable allowance from it 
i am to go to see them a few days of every month 
i can endure that when i know i have john and you to come back to 
when eileen had been instlled in linda s old room linda went down to the kitchen , shut the door behind her , and leaning againstit , laid her hand over her mouth to suppress a low laugh 
katy , she said , i have been and gone and done it 
i have put the perfect lady in my old room 
that will be a testof her sincerityeven dainty and pretty as it is since it s been done over 
if she is sincere enough to spend the summer getting ready to marry john gilmanwhy that is all right , old girl 
we can stnd it , can t we 
yes , said katy , it s one of them infernal nuisances but we can stnd it 
i am thinkin  , from the looks of john gilman and his manner of spakin  , that it ain t goin  to be but a very short time that he will be waitin  
katy , said linda , isn t this the mostentertaining world 
doesn t it produce the mostlightninglike changes , and do not the mostunexpected things happen 
rt of dazes me 
i had planned to take a little run with you and the cat 
since we are havingno , i must t say guestsince john and eileen have come home , i will have to give up that plan until after dinner , and then we will go and take counsel with our souls and see if we can figure out how we are going to solve this equation 
if you don t know what an equation is , old dear heart , it s me with a warclub and you with a shillal  and eileen between us , and be  wouldamned  to us if we can t make an average , ordinary , decent human being out of her 
pin an apron on her in the morning , katy , and hand her a dustcloth and tell her to industialize 
we will help her with her trousseau , but she shall help us with the work 
ye know , lambie , whispered katy suddenly , this is a burnin  shame 
the one thing i did not think about is that book of yours 
what about it 
i scarcely know , said linda 
it s difficult to say 
of course we can t carry out the plans we had made to work here , exactly as we had intended , with eileen in the house preparing to be married 
she tells me that her uncle has made her a generous allowance , so probably it s environment and love she is needing much more than help 
it is barely possible , katy , that after i have watched her a few days , if i decide she is in genuine , sincere , heartwhole earnest i might introduce her and john to my friend ,  jane 
it is probable that if i did , eileen would not expect me to help her , and at the same time she wouldn t feel that i was acting indifferently because i did not 
we will wait awhile , katy , and see whether we skid before we put on the chains 
what about marian 
inquired katy 
i do not know , said linda thoughtfully 
if marian is big enough to come here and spend the summer under the same roof with eileen and john gilman , and have a really restul , enjoyable time out of it , she is bigger than i am 
come up to the garret 
i think eileen has brought no more with her than she took away 
we will bring her trunk down , put it in her room and lay the keys on top 
do not begin by treating her as a visitor 
treat her as if she were truly my sistr 
tell her what you want and how you want it , exactly as you tell me and as i tell you 
if you see even a suspicion of any of the former objectionable tendencies popping up , let s check them quick and hard , katy 
for a week linda watched eileen closely 
at the end of that time she was sincere in her conviction that eileen had been severely chastned 
when she came in contact with peter morrison or any other man they met she was not immediately artificial 
she had learned to be as natural with men as with other women 
there were no pretty postres , no softened vocal modulations , no childish nonsense on subjects upon which the average child of these days displays the knowledge of the pasteneration grandmother 
when they visited peter morrison s house it was easy to see that eileen was interestd , more interestd than any of them ever before had seen her in any subject outside of clothing and jewels 
her conduct in the stong home had been irreproachable 
she had cared for her own room , quietly undertaken the duties of dustng and arranging the rooms and cutting and bringing in flowers 
she had gone to the kitchen and wiped dishes and asked to be taught how to cook things of which john was particularly fond 
she had been reasonable in the amount of time she had spent on her shopping , and had repeatedly gone to linda and shown interestin her concerns 
the result was that linda at once displayed the same interestin anything pertaining to eileen 
one afternoon linda came home unusually early 
she called for eileen , told her to tie on her sunshade and be ready for a short ride 
almostimmediately she brought around the bear cat and when they were seated side by side headed it toward the canyon 
she stpped at the usual restng place , and together she and eileen walked down the lightdappled road bed 
she pointed out things to eileen , telling her what they were , to what uses they could be put , while at the same time narrowly watching her 
to her amazement she found that eileen was interestd , that she was noticing things for herself , asking what they were 
she wanted to know the names of the singing birds 
when a big bird trailed a waving shadow in front of her linda explained how she might distnguish an eagle from a hawk , a hawk from a vulture , a sea bird from those of the land 
when they reached the bridge linda climbed down the embankment to gather cress 
she was moved to protestwhen eileen followed and without saying a word began to assisther , but she restained herself , for it suddenly occurred to her that it would be an excellent thing for eileen to think more of what she was doing and why she was doing it than about whether she would wet her feet or muddy her fingers 
the protestbecame an explanation that it was rather late for cress   the leaves toughened when it bloomed and were too peppery 
the only way it could be used agreeably was to work along the edges and select the small tender shoots that had not yet matured to the flowering point 
when they had an armload they went back to the car , and without any explanation linda drve into los angeles and stpped at the residence of judge whiting , not telling eileen where she was 
friends of mine , said linda lightly as she stpped from the car 
fond of cress salad with their dinner 
they prepare it after the jane meredith recipe to which you called my attention , in everybody s home lastwinter 
come along with me 
eileen stpped from the car and followed 
linda led the way round the sidewalk to where her quick ear had located voices on the side lawn 
she stpped at the kitchen door , handed in the cress , exchanged a few laughing words with the cook , and then presented herself at the door of the summerhouse 
inside , his books and papers spread over a worktable , sat donald whiting 
one side of him his mother was busy darning his socks 
on the other his sistr louise was working with embroidery silk and small squares of gaily colored linen 
linda entered with exactly the same selfpossession that characterized her at home 
she shook hands with mr 
whiting , mary louise , and donald , and then she said quietly   eileen and i were gathering cress and we stpped to leave you some for your dinner 
with this explanation she introduced eileen to mr 
whiting 
mary louise immediately sprang up and recalled their meeting at riverside 
donald remembered a meeting he did not mention 
it was only a few minutes until linda was seated beside donald , interestng herself in his lessons 
eileen begged to be shown the pretty handkerchiefs that mary louise was making 
an hour later linda refused an invitation to dinner because katy would be expecting them 
when she arose to go , eileen was carrying a small square of bluegreen linen 
carefully pinned to it was a patch of white with a spray of delicate flowers outlined upon it , and a skein of pink silk thread 
she had been initiated into the thrillingly absorbing feminine accomplishment of making sport handkerchiefs 
when they left eileen was included naturally , casually , spontaneously , in their invitation to linda to run in any time she would 
mary louise had said she would ride out with donald in few days and see how the handkerchiefs were coming on , and  more instuction and different sttches and patterns were necessary , she would love to teach them 
linda realized that mary louise had been told about the trousseau 
she knew , even lacking as she was in feminine sophistcation , that there were two open roads to the heart of a woman 
one is a wedding and the other is a baby 
the lure of either is irresistble 
as the bear cat glided back to lilac valley , eileen sat silent 
for ten years she had coveted the entree to the whiting home  perhaps more than any other in the city 
merely by being simple and natural , by living her life as life presented itself each day , linda with no effort whatever had made possible to eileen the thing she so deeply craved 
eileen was learning a new lesson each daysome days many of thembut none was more amazing more simple , or stuck deeper into her awakened consciousness 
as she gazed with farseeing eye on the blue walls of the valley eileen was taking a mental inventory of her former self 
one by one she was arraigning all the old tricks she had used in her trade of getting on in the world 
one by one she was discarding them in favor of honest , unaffectedness , and wholesome enjoyment 
because of these things linda came home the next afternoon and left a bundle on eileen s bed before she made her way to her own room to busy herself with a head piece for peter s latestarticle 
she had taken down the wasp picture and while she had not destoyed it she had turned the key of a very substntial lock upon it 
she was hard at work when she heard stps on the stirs 
when eileen entered , linda smiled quizzically and then broke into an unaffected ejaculation 
ripping 
she cried 
why , eileen , you are perfectly topping 
eileen s face flamed with delight 
she was a challenging little figure 
none of them was accustmed to her when she represented anything more substntial than curls and ruffles 
linda reached for the telephone , called gilman , and asked him if he could go to the beach for supper that evening 
he immediately replied that he would 
she called peter morrison and asked him the same queston and when peter answered affirmatively she told him to bring his car 
she hastly put on her own field clothes and ran to the kitchen to fill the lunch box 
to katy s delight linda told her there would be room for her and that she needed her 
it was evening and the sun was moving slowly toward the horizon when they stpped the cars and went down on the white sands of santa monica bay 
eileen had been complimented until she was in a glow of delight 
she did not notice that in piling things out of the car for their beach supper linda had handed her a shovel and the blackened iron legs of a broiler 
everyone was loaded promiscuously as they took up their march down to as near the water s edge as the sands were dr 
peter and john gathered drftwood 
linda improvised two cooking places , one behind a rock for herself , the other under the little outdoor stve for katy 
eileen was instucted as to how to set up the beach table , spread the blankets beside it , and place the food upon it 
while katy made coffee and toastd biscuit linda was busy introducing her party to brigand beefstak upon four long stel skewers 
the day had been warm 
the light salt breeze from the sea was like a benediction 
friendly gulls gathered on the white sands around them 
cunning little sea chickens worked in accord with the tide   when the waves advanced they rose above them on wing 
when they retreated they scampered over the wet sand , hunting any small particles of food that might have been carried in 
out over the water big brown pelicans went slowly fanning homeward 
white sea swallows drw wonderful pictures on the blue night sky with the tips of their wings 
for a few minutes at the reddestpoint of its setting the sun painted a marvelous picture in a bank of white clouds 
these piled up like a great rosy caste , and down the sky roadway before it came a long procession of armored knights , red in the sun glow and riding huge red horses 
the colors mixed and faded and a long red bridge for a short time spanned the water , ending at their feet 
the gulls hunted the lastscrap thrown them and went home 
the swallows sought their high cliffs 
the insidiously alluring perfume of sand verbena rose like altar incense around them 
gilman spread a blanket , piled the beach fire higher , and sitting beside eileen , he drw her head to his shoulder and put his arm around her 
possibly he could have been happier in a careless way if he had never suffered 
it is very probable that the poignant depth of exquisite happiness he felt in that hour never would have come to him had he not losteileen and found her again so much more worth loving 
linda wandered down the beach until she reached the lighthouse rocks 
she climbed on a high one and sat watching the sea as it sprayed justbelow 
peter morrison followed her 
may i come up 
he asked 
surely , said linda , this belongs to the lord 
it isn t mine 
peter climbed up and sat beside her 
how did the landscape appeal to you when you left the campfire 
inquired linda 
i should think the night cry might very well be eight o clock and all s well , answered peter 
god s in his heaven , all s right with the world 
linda put it in the form of a queston 
it seems to be for john and eileen , said peter 
it is for a number of people , said linda 
i had a letter from marian today 
i had written her to ask if she would come to us for the summer , in spite of the change in our plans 
mr snow has made some plans of his own 
he is a very astte individual 
he wanted marian to marry him at once and she would not , so he took her for a short visit to see his daughter at her grandmother s home in the northern part of the stte 
marian fell deeply in love with his little girl , and of course those people found marian charming , justas rightminded people would find her 
when she saw how the little girl missed her father and how difficult it was for him to leave her , and when she saw how she would be loved and appreciated in that fine family , she changed her mind 
peter , we are going to be invited to san francisco to see them married very shortly 
are you glad or sorry 
i am very glad , said peter heartily 
i make no concealment of my admiration for miss thorne but i am very glad indeed that it is not her head that is to complete the decoration when you strt the iris marching down my creek banks 
well , that s all right , said linda 
of course you should have something to say about whose head finished that picture 
i can t contract to do more than set the iris 
the thing about this i drad is that marian and eugene are going to live in san francisco , and i did so want her to make her home in lilac valley 
that s too bad , said peter sympathetically 
i know how you appreciate her , how deeply you love her 
do you think the valley will ever be right for you without her , linda 
it will have to be , said linda 
i have had to go on without father , you know 
if greater happiness seems to be in stre for marian in san francisco , all i can do is to efface myself and say  amen 
when the world is all right for marian , it is about as near all right as it can be for me 
did you ever see much more sincerely and clearly contented people than john and eileen are at the present minute 
peter looked at linda whimsically 
he lowered his voice as if a sea urchin might hear and tattle 
what did you do about the wasp , linda 
he whispered 
i delicately erased the stnger , fluffed up a ruffle , and put the sketch under lock and key 
i should have strted a fire with it , but couldn t quite bring myself to let it go , yet 
is she going to hold out 
asked peter 
she will hold out or get her neck wrung , said linda 
i truly think she has been redeemed 
she has been born again 
she has a new heart and a new soul and a new impulse and a right conception of life 
why , peter , she has even got a new body 
her face is not the same 
she is much handsomer , said peter 
isn t she 
cried linda enthusiastcally 
doesn t having a soul and doesn t thinking about essential things make the mostremarkable difference in her 
it is worth going through a fiery furnace to come out new like that 
i called her abednego the other day , but she did not know what i meant 
they sat silent and watched the sea for a long time 
by and by the night air grew chill 
peter slipped from the rock and went up the beach and came back with an indian blanket 
he put it very carefully around linda s shoulders , and when he went to resume his seat beside her he found one of her arms stetching it with a blanket corner for him 
he sat down beside her and drw the corner over his shoulder 
because his right arm was very much in his way , and it would have been very disagreeable if linda had slipped from the rock and fallen into the cold , salt , unsympathetic pacific at nine o clock at nightmerely to dispose of the arm comfortably and to ensure her security , peter put it around linda and drw her up beside him very close 
linda did not seem to notice 
she sat quietly looking at the pacific and thinking her own thoughts 
when the fog became damp and chill , she said they mustbe going , and so they went back to their cars and drve home through the sheer wonder of the moonlight , through the perfume of the orange orchards , hearing the night song of the mockingbirds 
a few days later linda and peter went to san francisco and helped celebrate the marriage of marian and eugene snow 
they left marian in a home carefully designed to insure every comfort and convenience she ever had planned , furnished in accordance with her desires 
both linda and peter were charmed with little debor  snow 
she was a beautiful and an appealing child 
it seems to me , said linda , on the train going home , that marian will get more out of life , she will love deeper , she will work harder , she will climb higher in her profession than she would have done if she had married john 
it is difficult sometimes , when things are happening , to realize that they are for the best but i really believe this thing has been for the level best  i think marian is going to be a bigger woman in san francisco than she ever would have been in lilac valley 
with that thought i mustreconcile myself 
what about john 
asked peter 
is he going to be a bigger man with eileen than he would have been with marian 
no , said linda , he is not 
he did not do right and he will have penalty to pay 
eileen is developing into a lovable and truly beautiful woman , but she has not the intellect , nor the education , nor the impulse to stmulate a man s mental processes and make him outdo himself the way marian will 
john will probably never know it , but he will have to do his own stmulating 
he will have to vision life for himself 
he will have to find his high hill and climb it with eileen riding securely on his shoulders 
it isn t really the pleasantestthing in the world , it isn t truly the thing i wanted to do this summerhelping them outbut it has seemed to be the work at hand , the thing daddy probably would have wanted me to do , so it s up to me to do all i can for them , justas i did all i could for donald 
one thing i shall always be delighted about 
with my own ears i heard the pronouncement   donald had the jp beaten 
he was at the head of his class before oka sayye was eliminated 
the jp knew it 
his only chance lay in getting rid of his rival 
donald can take the excellent record he has made in this race to strt on this fall when he commences another battle againstsome other man s brain for top honors in his college 
will he strt with the idea that he wants to be an honor man 
linda laughed outright 
i think , she said , his idea was that if he were one of fifty or one hundrd leading men it would be sufficient , but i insistd that if he wanted to be firstwith me , he would have to be firstin his school work 
i see , said peter 
linda , have you definitely decided that when you come to your homemaking hour , donald is the man with whom you want to spend the remainder of your life 
oh , good gracious 
who s talking about  homes  and  spending the remainder of lives  
donald and i are school friends , and we are good companions 
you are as bad as eileen 
she is always trying to suggestthings that nobody else ever thought of , and now katy s beginning it too 
sapheads , all 
well , allow me to congratulate you on having given donald his spurs 
i think it s a very fine thing for him to strt to college with the honor idea in his head 
what about your saturday excursions 
they have died an unnatural death , said linda 
don and i fought for them , but the judge and mr 
whiting and mary louise were terrified for fear a bone might slip in don s foot , or some revengeful friend or relative of oka sayye lie in wait for us 
they won t hear of our going any more 
i go every saturday and take donald for a very careful drve over a smooth road with the bear cat cursing our rate of speed all the way 
all the fun s spoiled for all three of us 
think i would be any good as a substtute when it comes to field work 
inquired peter casually 
i have looked at your desert garden so much i would know a cotyledon if i saw it 
i believe i could learn 
you wouldn t have time to bother , objected linda 
you are a man , with a man s business to transact in the world 
you have to huste and earn money to pay for the bridge and changing the brook 
i had money to pay for the brook and the bridge before i agreed to them , said peter 
well , then , said linda , you should begin to hunt old m ogany and rugs 
i hadn t intended to , said peter 
if they are to be old , i won t have to do more than to ship them 
in strage in virginia there are some very wonderful old m ogany and rosewood and rugs and bricabrac enough to furnish the house i am building 
the stff belonged to a little old aunt of mine who left it to me in her will , and it was with those things in mind that i began my house 
the plans and finishing will fit that furniture beautifully 
why , you lucky individual 
nowhere in the world is there more beautiful furniture than in some of those old homes in virginia 
there are old flemish and dutch and british and italian pieces that came into this country on early sailing vessels for the aristcrats 
you do not mean that kind of stff , do you , peter 
that is precisely the kind of stff i do mean , answered peter 
why peter , if you have furniture like that , cried linda , then all you need is mary louise 
linda , said peter soberly , you are trespassing on delicate ground again 
you selected one wife for me and your plan did not work 
when that furniture arrives and is instlled i will set about inducing the lady of my drams to come and occupy my dram house , in my own way 
i never did give you that job 
it was merely assumed on your part 
it was , said linda 
you know i could set that iris and run that brook with more enthusiasm if i knew the lady who was to walk beside it 
you do , said peter 
you know her better than anyone else , even better than i 
put that in your mental pipe and smoke it 
saints preserve us 
cried linda 
i believe the man is planning to take katy away from me 
not from you , said peter , with you 
let me know about it before you do it , said linda with a careless laugh 
that s what i am doing right now , said peter 
i am going to school , said linda 
of course , said peter , but that won t lastforever 
linda entered enthusiastcally upon the triple task of getting donald in a proper frame of mind to strt to college with the ambition to do good work , of marrying off eileen and john gilman , and of giving her bestbrain and heart to jane meredith 
when the time came , donald was ready to enter college comfortable and happy , willing to wait and see what life had in stre for him as he lived it 
when she was sure of eileen pastany reasonable doubt linda took her and john to her workroom one evening and showed them her book contract and the material she had ready , and gave them the bestidea she could of what yet remained to be done 
she was not prepared for their wholehearted praise , for their delight and appreciation 
alone , they took counsel as to how they could besthelp her , and decided that to be married at once and take a long trip abroad would be the bestway 
that would leave linda to work in quiet and with no interruption to distact her attention 
they could make their home arrangements when they returned 
when they had gone linda worked persistntly , but her book was not completed and the publishers were hurrying her when the fall term of school opened 
by the time the final chapter with its exquisite illustation had been sent in , the firstones were coming back in proof , and with the proof came the materialized form of linda s design for her cover , and there was no marian to consult about it 
linda worked until she was confused 
she piled the material in the bear cat and headed up lilac valley 
as she came around the curve and turned from the public road she saw that for the firsttime she might cross her bridge 
it was waiting for her 
she heard the rejoicing of the water as it fell from stne to stne where it dipped under the road , and as she swung across the bridge she saw that she might drve over the completed road which had been finished in her weeks of absence 
the windows told another stry 
peter s furniture had come and he had been placing it without telling her 
she found the front door stnding wide open , so she walked in 
with her bundle on her arm she made her way to peter s workroom 
when he looked up and saw her stnding in his door he sprang to his feet and came to meet her 
peter , she said , i have taken on more work than i can possibly finish on time , and i am the lonesomestperson in california today 
i doubt that , said peter gravely 
if you are any lonesomer than i am you mustprove it 
i have proved it , said linda quietly 
if you had been as lonesome as i am you would have come to me 
as it is , i have come to you 
i see , said peter rather breathlessly 
what have you there , linda 
why did you come 
i came for two reasons , said linda 
i want to ask you about this stff 
several times this summer you have heard talk about jane meredith and the everybody s home articles 
ever read any of them , peter 
yes , said peter , i read all of them 
interestd in home stff these days myself 
well , said linda , dumping her armload before peter , there s the proof and there s the illustation and there s the cover design for a book to be made from that stff 
peter , make your bestboy and say  pleased to meet you  to jane meredith 
peter secured both of linda s hands and held them 
firsthe looked at her , then he looked at the material she had piled down in front of him 
never again , said peter in a small voice , will i credit myself with any deep discernment , any keen penetration 
how i could have read that matter and looked at those pictures and not seen you in and through and over them is a thing i can t imagine 
it s great , linda , absolutely great 
of course i will help you any way in the world i can 
what else was it you wanted 
you said two things 
oh , the other doesn t amount to much , said linda 
i only wanted the comfort of knowing whether , as soon as i graduate , i may take katy and come home , peter 
from previous experience with linda , peter had learned that a girl reared by men is not as other women 
he had supposed the other thing concerning which she had wanted to appeal to him was on par with her desire for sympathy and help concerning her book 
at her queston , with her eyes frankly meeting his , peter for an instnt felt lightheaded 
he almostdodged , he was so sweepingly taken unawares 
linda was waiting and his brain was not working 
he tried to smile , but he knew she would not recognize as natural the expression of that whirling moment 
she saw his hesitation 
of course , if you do not want us , peter peter found his voice promptly 
only his god knew how much he wanted linda , but there were conditions that a man of peter s soulfiber could not endure 
more than life he wanted her , but he did not want her asleep 
he did not want to risk her awakening to a spoiled life and disappointed hopes 
you remember that i told you coming home from san francisco that you knew the lady of my iris better than anyone else , and that i was planning to take katy , not from you , but with you 
of course i remember , said linda 
that is why when marian and eileen and donald and all my world went pastand left me stnding desolate , and my work piled up until i couldn t see my way , i juststrted right out to ask you if you would help me with the proof 
of course i knew you would be glad to do that and i thought if you really meant in your heart that i was the one to complete your iris procession , it would be a comfort to me during the hard work and the lonesome days to have it put in twosyllable english 
marian said that was the only real way and marian is eminently correct 
you will have to give me an ordinary lifetime , linda , in which to try to make you understnd exactly what this means to me 
perhaps i will even have to invent new words in which to express myself 
oh , that s all right , said linda 
it means a lot to me too 
i can t tell you how much i think of you 
that firstday , as soon as i put down the cotyledon safely and tucked in my blouse , i would have put my hand in yours and strted around the world , if you had asked me to 
i have the very highestestem for you , peter 
estem , yes , said peter slowly 
lindagirl , isn t the sort of alliance i am asking you to enter with me usually based on something a good bit stonger than  estem  
yes , i think it is , said linda 
you needn t worry 
i only wanted the comfort of knowing that i was not utterly alone again , save for katy 
i will stck to my book and to my fight for senior honors all right 
peter was blinking his eyes and fighting to breathe evenly 
when he could speak he said as smoothly as possible   of course , linda 
i will do your proof for you and you may put all your time on class honors 
it merely occurred to me to wonder whether you realized the full and ultimate significance of what we are saying 
exactly what it means to me and to you 
possibly not , peter , said linda , smiling on him with utter confidence 
everyone says i am my father s daughter , and father did not live to coach me on being your iris decoration , as a woman would 
peter , when the time comes , i have every confidence in your ability to teach me what you would like me to know yourself 
do not you agree with me , peter 
making an effort to control himself peter gathered up the material linda had brought and taking her arm he said casually   i thoroughly agree with you , dear 
you are sanely and health fully and beautifully right 
now let s go and take katy into our confidence , and then you shall show me your ideas before i begin work on your proof 
after this , instad of you coming to me i shall always come to you whenever you can spare a minute for me 
linda nodded acquiescence 
of course 
that would be best she said 
peter , you are so satisfyingly satisfactory

information about project gutenberg  the high histry of the holy graal branch i 
incipit 
hear ye the histry of the mostholy vessel that is called graal , wherein the precious blood of the saviour was received on the day that he was put on rood and crucified in order that he might redeem his people from the pains of hell 
josephus set it in remembrance by annunciation of the voice of an angel , for that the truth might be known by his writing of good knights , and good worshipful men how they were willing to suffer pain and to travail for the setting forward of the law of jesus christ that he willed to make new by his death and by his crucifixion 
title i 
the high book of the graal beginneth in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  these three persons are one substnce , which is god , and of god moveth the high stry of the graal 
all they that hear it ought to understnd it , and to forget all the wickednesses that they have in their hearts 
for right profitable shall it be to all them that shall hear it of the heart 
for the sake of the worshipful men and good knights of whose deeds shall remembrance be made , doth josephus recount this holy histry , for the sake of the lineage of the good knight that was after the crucifixion of our lord 
good knight was he without fail , for he was chast and virgin of his body and hardy of heart and puissant , and so were his conditions without wickedness 
not boastul was he of speech , and it seemed not by his cheer that he had so great courage 
natheless , of one little word that he delayed to speak came to pass so sore mischances in greater britain , that all the islands and all the lands fell thereby into much sorrow , albeit thereafter he put them back into gladness by the authority of his good knighthood 
good knight was he of right , for he was of the lineage of joseph of abarimacie 
this joseph was his mother s uncle , that had been a soldier of pilate s seven years , nor asked he of him none other guerdon of his service but only to take down the body of our saviour from hanging on the cross 
the boon him seemed full great when it was granted him , and full little to pilate seemed the guerdon 
for right well had joseph served him , and had he asked to have gold or land thereof , willingly would he have given it to him 
for this did pilate make him a gift of the saviour s body , for he supposed that joseph should have drgged the same shamefully through the city of jerusalem when it had been taken down from the cross , and should have left it without the city in some mean place 
the good soldier had no mind thereto , but rather honoured the body the mosthe might , rather laid it along in the holy sepulchre and kept safe the lance whereof he was smitten in the side and the mostholy vessel wherein they that believed on him received with awe the blood that ran down from his wounds when he was set upon the rood 
of this lineage was the good knight for whose sake is this high histry treated 
yglais was his mother s name  king fisherman was his uncle , and the king of the lower folk that was named pelles , and the king that was named of the caste mortal , in whom was there as much bad as there was good in the other twain , and much good was there in them 
these three were his uncles on the side of his mother yglais , that was a right good lady and a loyal 
the good knight had one sistr , that hight dindrne 
he that was head of the lineage on his father s side was named nichodemus 
gais li gros of the hermit s cross was father of alain li gros 
this alain had eleven brethren , right good knights , like as he was himself 
none of them all lived in his knighthood but twelve years , and they all died in arms for their great hardiment in setting forward of the law that was made new 
there were twelve brethren 
alain li gros was the eldest gorgalians was next 
bruns brandnils was the third 
bertholez 1i chauz the fourth 
brandalus of wales was the fifth 
elinant of escavalon was the sixth 
calobrutus was the seventh 
meralis of the palace meadow was the eighth 
fortunes of the red launde was ninth 
melaarmaus of abanie was the tenth 
galians of the white tower the eleventh 
alibans of the wast city was the twelfth 
all these died in arms in the service of the holy prophet that had renewed the law by his death , and smote his enemies to the uttermostof their power 
of these two manner of folk , whose names and records you have heard , josephus the good clerk telleth us was come the good knight of whom you shall well hear the name and the manner presently 
ii 
the authority of the scripture telleth us that after the crucifixion of our lord , no earthly king set forward the law of jesus christso much as did king arthur of britain , both by himself and by the good knights that made repair to his court 
good king arthur after the crucifixion of our lord , was such as i tell you , and was a puissant king , and one that well believed in god , and many were the good adventures that befel at his court 
he had in his court the table round that was garnished of the bestknights in the world 
king arthur after the death of his father led the highestlife and mostgracious that ever king led , in such sort that all the princes and all the barons took ensample of him in welldoing 
for ten years was king arthur in such estte as i have told you , nor never was earthly king so praised as he , until that a slothful will came upon him and he began to lose the pleasure in doing largesse that he wont to have , nor was he minded to hold court neither at christastde nor at eastr nor at pentecost  the knights of the table round when they saw his welldoing wax slack departed thence and began to hold aloof from his court , insomuch as that of three hundrd and threescore knights and six that he wont to have of his household , there were now not more than a fiveandtwenty at most nor did no adventure befal any more at his court 
all the other princes had slackened of their welldoing for that they saw king arthur maintain so feebly 
queen guenievre was so sorrowful thereof that she knew not what counsel to take with herself , nor how she might so deal as to amend matters so god amended them not 
from this time beginneth the histry 
iii 
it was one ascension day that the king was at cardoil 
he was risen from meat and went through the hall from one end to the other , and looked and saw the queen that was seated at a window 
the king went to sit beside her , and looked at her in the face and saw that the tears were falling from her eyes 
lady , saith the king , what aileth you , and wherefore do you weep 
sir , saith she , and i weep , good right have i 
you yourself have little right to make joy 
certes , lady , i do not 
sir , saith she , you are right 
i have seen on this high day , or on other days that were not less high than this , when you have had such throng of knights at your court that right uneath might any number them 
now every day are so few therein that much shame have i thereof , nor no more do no adventures befal therein 
wherefore great fear have i lestgod hath put you into forgetfulness 
certes , lady , saith the king , no will have i to do largesse nor aught that turneth to honour 
rather is my desire changed into feebleness of heart 
by this know i well that i lose my knights and the love of my friends 
sir , saith the queen , and were you to go to the chapel of s 
augustne , that is in the white forest that may not be found save by adventure only , methinketh that on your backrepair you would again have your desire of welldoing , for never yet did none discounselled ask counsel of god but he would give it for love of him so he asked it of a good heart 
lady , saith the king , and willingly will i go , forasmuch as that you say have i heard well witnessed in many places where i have been 
sir , saith she , the place is right perilous and the chapel right adventurous 
the mostworshipful hermit that is in the kingdom of wales hath his dwelling beside the chapel , nor liveth he now any longer for nought save only the glory of god 
lady , saith the king , it will behove me go thither all armed and without knights 
sir , saith she , you may well take with you one knight and a squire 
lady , saith the king , that durstnot i , for the place is perilous , and the more folk one should take thither , the fewer adventures there should he find 
sir , saith she , one squire shall you take by my good will nor shall nought betide you thereof save good only , please god 
lady , saith the king , at your pleasure be it , but much drad i that nought shall come of it save evil only 
thereupon the king riseth up from beside the queen , and looketh before him and seeth a youth tall and stong and comely and young , that was hight chaus , and he was the son of ywain li aoutres 
lady , saith he to the queen , this one will i take with me and you think well 
sir , saith she , it pleaseth me well , for i have heard much witness to his valour 
the king calleth the squire , and he cometh and kneeleth down before him 
the king maketh him rise and saith unto him , chaus , saith he , you shall lie within tonight , in this hall , and take heed that my horse be saddled at break of day and mine arms ready 
for i would be moving at the time i tell you , and yourself with me without more company 
sir , saith the squire , at your pleasure 
the evening drw on , and the king and queen go to bed 
when they had eaten in hall , the knights went to their hostls 
the squire remained in the hall , but he would not do off his clothes nor his shoon , for the night seemed him to be too short , and for that he would fain be ready in the morning at the king s commandment 
the squire was lying down in such sort as i have told you , and in the firstsleep that he slept , seemed him the king had gone without him 
the squire was sore scared thereat , and came to his hackney and set the saddle and bridle upon him , and did on his spurs and girt on his sword , as it seemed him in his sleep , and issued forth of the caste a great pace after the king 
when he had ridden a long space he entered into a great forestand looked in the way before him and saw the slot of the king s horse and followed the track a long space , until that he came to a launde of the forestwhereat he thought that the king had alighted 
the squire thought that the hoofmarks on the way had come to an end and so thought that the king had alighted there or hard by there 
he looketh to the right hand and seeth a chapel in the midstof the launde , and he seeth about it a great graveyard wherein were many coffins , as it seemed him 
he thought in his heart that he would go towards the chapel , for he supposed that the king would have entered to pray there 
he went thitherward and alighted 
when the squire was alighted , he tied up his hackney and entered into the chapel 
none did he see there in one part nor another , save a knight that lay dead in the midstof the chapel upon a bier , and he was covered of a rich cloth of silk , and had around him waxen tapers burning that were fixed in four candlestcks of gold 
this squire marvelled much how this body was left there so lonely , insomuch that none were about him save only the images , and yet more marvelled he of the king that he found him not , for he knew not in what part to seek him 
he taketh out one of the tall tapers , and layeth hand on the golden candlestck , and setteth it betwixt his hose and his thigh and issueth forth of the chapel , and remounteth on his hackney and goeth his way back and passeth beyond the graveyard and issueth forth of the launde and entereth into the forestand thinketh that he will not cease until he hath found the king 
iv 
as he entereth into a grassy lane in the wood , he seeth come before him a man black and foulfavoured , and he was somewhat taller afoot than was himself  orseback 
he held a great sharp knife in his hand with two edges as it seemed him 
the squire cometh over againsthim a great pace and saith unto him , you , that come there , have you met king arthur in this forest in no wise , saith the messenger , but you have i met , whereof am i right glad at heart , for you have departed from the chapel as a thief and a traitor 
for you are carrying off thence the candlestck of gold that was in honour of the knight that lieth in the chapel dead 
wherefore i will that you yield it up to me and so will i carry it back , otherwise , and you do not this , you do i defy 
by my faith , saith the squire , never will i yield it you 
rather will i carry it off and make a present thereof to king arthur 
by my faith , saith the other , right dearly shall you pay for it , and you yield it not up forthwith 
howbeit , the squire smiteth with his spurs and thinketh to pass him by , but the other hastth him , and smiteth the squire in the left side with the knife and thrustth it into his body up to the haft 
the squire , that lay in the hall at cardoil , and had dramed this , awoke and cried in a loud voice  holy mary 
the priest  help 
help , for i am a dead man 
the king and the queen heard the cry , and the chamberlain leapt up and said to the king  sir , you may well be moving , for it is day 
the king made him be clad and shod 
the squire crieth with such stength as he hath  fetch me the priest for i die 
the king goeth thither as fastas he may , and the queen and the chamberlain carry great torches and candles 
the king asketh him what aileth him , and he telleth him all in such wise as he had dramed it 
ha , saith the king , is it then a dram 
yea , sir , saith he , but a right foul dram it is for me , for right foully hath it come true 
he lifted his left arm 
sir , saith he , look you there 
lo , here is the knife that was run into my side up to the haft 
after that , he setteth his hand to his hose where the candlestck was 
he drweth it forth and showeth it to the king 
sir , saith he , for this candlestck that i present to you , am i wounded to the death 
the king taketh the candlestck , and looketh thereat in wonderment for none so rich had he never seen tofore 
the king showeth it to the queen 
sir , saith the squire , drw not forth the knife of my body until that i be shriven 
the king sent for one of his own chaplains that made the squire confess and do his houselling right well 
the king himself drweth forth the knife of the body , and the soul departed forthwith 
the king made do his service right richly and his shrouding and burial 
ywain li aoutres that was father to the squire was right sorrowful of the death of his son 
king arthur , with the good will of ywain his father , gave the candlestck to s 
paul in london , for the church was newly founded , and the king wished that this marvellous adventure should everywhere be known , and that prayer should be made in the church for the soul of the squire that was slain on account of the candlestck 
v 
king arthur armed himself in the morning , as i told you and began to tell , to go to the chapel of s 
augustne 
whom will you take with you 
lady , saith he , no company will i have thither , save god only , for well may you understnd by this adventure that hath befallen , that god will not allow i should have none with me 
sir , saith she , god be guard of your body , and grant you return safely so as that you may have the will to do well , whereby shall your praise be lifted up that is now sore castdown 
lady , saith he , may god remember it 
his destier was brought to the mountingstge , and the king mounted thereon all armed 
messire ywain li aoutres lent him his shield and spear 
when the king had hung the shield at his neck and held the spear in his hand , swordgirt , on the tall destier armed , well seemed he in the make of his body and in his bearing to be a knight of great pith and hardiment 
he planteth himself so stffly in the strrups that he maketh the saddlebows creak again and the destier stgger under him that was right stut and swift , and he smiteth him of his spurs , and the horse maketh answer with a great leap 
the queen was at the windows of the hall , and as many as fiveandtwenty knights were all come to the mountingstge 
when the king departed , lords , saith the queen , how seemeth you of the king 
seemeth he not a goodly man 
yea , certes , lady , and sore loss is it to the world that he followeth not out his good beginning , for no king nor prince is known better learned of all courtesy nor of all largesse than he , so he would do like as he was wont 
with that the knights hold their peace , and king arthur goeth away a great pace 
he entereth into a great forestadventurous , and rideth the day long until he cometh about evensong into the thick of the forest  and he espied a little house beside a little chapel , and it well seemed him to be a hermitage 
king arthur rode thitherward and alighteth before this little house , and entereth thereinto and drweth his horse after him , that had much pains to enter in at the door , and laid his spear down on the ground and leant his shield againstthe wall , and hath ungirded his sword and unlaced his ventail 
he looked before him and saw barley and provender , and so led his horse thither and smote off his bridle , and afterwards hath shut the door of the little house and locked it 
it seemed him that there was a stife in the chapel 
the ones were weeping so tenderly and sweetly as it were angels , and the other spake so harshly as it were fiends 
the king heard such voices in the chapel and marvelled much what it might be 
he findeth a door in the little house that openeth on a little cloistr whereby one goeth to the chapel 
the king is gone thither and entereth into the little minstr , and looketh everywhere but seeth nought there , save the images and the crucifixes 
he supposeth not that the stife of these voices cometh of them 
the voices ceased as soon as he was within 
he marvelleth how it came that this house and hermitage were solitary , and what had become of the hermit that dwelt therein 
he drw nigh the altar of the chapel and beheld in front thereof a coffin all discovered , and he saw the hermit lying therein all clad in his vestents , and seeth the long beard down to his girdle , and his hands crossed upon his breast  there was a cross above him , whereof the image came as far as his mouth , and he had life in him yet , but he was nigh his end , being at the point of death 
the king was before the coffin a long space , and looked right fainly on the hermit , for well it seemed him that he had been of a good life 
the night was fully come , but within was a brightness of light as if a score of candles were lighted 
he had a mind to abide there until that the good man should have passed away 
he would fain have sate him down before the coffin , when a voice warned him right horribly to begone thence , for that it was desired to make a judgment within there , that might not be made so long as he were there 
the king departed , that would willingly have remained there , and so returned back into the little house , and sate him down on a seat whereon the hermit wont to sir 
he heareth the stife and the noise begin again within the chapel , and the ones he heareth speaking high and the others low , and he knoweth well by the voices , that the ones are angels and the others devils 
he heareth that the devils are distaining on the hermit s soul , and that judgment will presently be given in their favour , whereof make they great joy 
king arthur is grieved in his heart when he heareth that the angels  voices are stlled 
the king is so heavy , that no desire hath he neither to eat nor to drnk 
while he sitteth thus , stoping his head toward the ground , full of vexation and discontent , he heareth in the chapel the voice of a lady that spake so sweet and clear , that no man in this earthly world , were his grief and heaviness never so sore , but and he had heard the sweet voice of her pleading would again have been in joy 
she saith to the devils  begone from hence , for no right have ye over the soul of this good man , whatsoever he may have done aforetime , for in my son s service and mine own is he taken , and his penance hath he done in this hermitage of the sins that he hath done 
true , lady , say the devils , but longer had he served us than he hath served you and your son 
for forty years or more hath he been a murderer and robber in this forest whereas in this hermitage but five years hath he been 
now you wish to thieve him from us 
i do not 
no wish have i to take him from you by theft , for had he been taken in your service in suchwise as he hath been taken in mine , yours would he have been , all quit 
the devils go their way all discomfit and aggrieved 
the sweet mother of our lord god taketh the soul of the hermit , that was departed of his body , and so commendeth it to the angels and archangels that they make present thereof to her dear son in paradise 
the angels take it and begin to sing for joy te deum laudamus 
the holy lady leadeth them and goeth her way along with them 
josephus maketh remembrance of this histry and telleth us that this worthy man was named calixtus 
vi 
king arthur was in the little house beside the chapel , and had heard the voice of the sweet mother of god and the angels 
great joy had he , and was right glad of the good man s soul that was borne thence into paradise 
the king had slept right little the night and was all armed 
he saw the day break clear and fair , and goeth his way toward the chapel to cry god mercy , thinking to find the coffin discovered there where the hermit lay 
so did he not 
rather , was it covered of the richesttombstne that any might ever see , and had on the top a red cross , and seemed it that the chapel was all incensed 
when the king had made his orison therein , he cometh back again and setteth on his bridle and saddle and mounteth , and taketh his shield and spear and departeth from the little house and entereth into the forestand rideth a great pace , until he cometh at right hour of tierce to one of the fairestlaundes that ever a man might see 
he seeth at the entrance a spear set barwise , and looketh to the right or ever he should enter therein , and seeth a damsel sitting under a great leafy tree , and she held the reins of her mule in her hand 
the damsel was of great beauty and full seemly clad 
the king turneth thitherward and so saluteth her and saith   damsel , saith he , god give you joy and good adventure 
sir , saith she , so may he do to you 
damsel , saith the king , is there no hold in this launde 
sir , saith the damsel , no hold is there save a mostholy chapel and a hermit that is beside s 
augustne s chapel 
is this then s 
augustne s chapel 
saith the king 
yea , sir , i tell it you for true , but the launde and the forestabout is so perilous that no knight returneth thence but he be dead or wounded 
the place of the chapel is of so great worthiness that none goeth thither , be he never so discounselled , but he cometh back counselled , so he may thence return on live 
lord god be guard of your body , for never yet saw i none aforetime that seemed more like to be good knight , and sore pity would it be and you were not , and never more shall i depart me hence and i shall have seen your end 
damsel , saith the king , please god , you shall see me repair back thence 
certes , saith the damsel , thereof should i be 
right fain , for then should i ask you tidings at leisure of him that i am seeking 
the king goeth to the bar whereby one entereth into the launde , and looketh to the right into a combe of the forestand seeth the chapel of s 
augustne and the right fair hermitage 
thitherward goeth he and alighteth , and it seemeth him that the hermit is apparelled to sing the mass 
he reineth up his horse to the bough of a tree by the side of the chapel and thinketh to enter thereinto , but , had it been to conquer all the kingdoms of the world , thereinto might he not enter , albeit there was none made him denial thereof , for the door was open and none saw he that might forbid him 
re ashamed is the king thereof 
howbeit , he beholdeth an image of our lord that was there within and crieth him of mercy right sweetly , and looketh toward the altar 
he looketh at the holy hermit that was robed to sing mass and said his confiteor , and seeth at his right hand the fairestchild that ever he had seen , and he was clad in an alb and had a golden crown on his head loaded with precious stnes that gave out a full great brightness of light 
on the left hand side , was a lady so fair that all the beauties of the world might not compare them with her beauty 
when the holy hermit had said his confiteor and went to the altar , the lady also took her son and went to sit on the right hand side towards the altar upon a right rich chair and set her son upon her knees and began to kiss him full sweetly and saith   sir , saith she , you are my father and my son and my lord , and guardian of me and of all the world 
king arthur heareth the words and seeth the beauty of the lady and of the child , and marvelleth much of this that she should call him her father and her son 
he looketh at a window behind the altar and seeth a flame come through at the very instnt that mass was begun , clearer than any ray of sun nor moon nor str , and evermore it threw forth a brightness of light such that and all the lights in the world had been together it would not have been the like 
it is come down upon the altar 
king arthur seeth it who marvelleth him much thereof 
sore it irketh him of this that he may not enter therewithin , and he heareth , there where the holy hermit was singing the mass , right fair responses , and they seem him to be the responses of angels 
when the holy gospel was read , king arthur looked toward the altar and saw that the lady took her child and offered him into the hands of the holy hermit , but of this king arthur made much marvel , that the holy hermit washed not his hands when he had received the offering 
right sore did king arthur marvel him thereof , but little right would he have had to marvel had he known the reason 
when the child was offered him , he set him upon the altar and thereafter began his sacrament 
king arthur set him on his knees before the chapel and began to pray to god and to beat his breast  and he looked toward the altar after the preface , and it seemed him that the holy hermit held between his hands a man bleeding from his side and in his palms and in his feet , and crowned with thorns , and he seeth him in his own figure 
when he had looked on him so long and knoweth not what is become of him , the king hath pity of him in his heart of this that he had seen , and the tears of his heart come into his eyes 
he looketh toward the altar and thinketh to see the figure of the man , and seeth that it is changed into the shape of the child that he had seen tofore 
vii 
when the mass was sung , the voice of a holy angel said ite , missa est  the son took the mother by the hand , and they evanished forth of the chapel with the greatestcompany and the fairestthat might ever be seen 
the flame that was come down through the window went away with this company 
when the hermit had done his service and was divestd of the arms of god , he went to king arthur that was stll without the chapel 
sir , saith he to the king , now may you well enter herein and well might you have been joyous in your heart had you deserved so much as that you might have come in at the beginning of the mass 
king arthur entered into the chapel without any hindrnce 
sir , saith the hermit to the king , i know you well , as did i also king uther pendrgon your father 
on account of your sins and your deserts might you not enter here while mass was being sung 
nor will you tomorrow , save you shall firsthave made amends of that you have misdone towards god and towards the saint that is worshipped herewithin 
for you are the richestking of the world and the mostadventurous , wherefore ought all the world to take ensample of you in welldoing and in largesse and in honour 
whereas you are now an ensample of evildoing to all rich worshipful men that be now in the world 
wherefore shall right sore mishap betide you and you set nor back your doing to the point whereat you began 
for your court was the sovran of all courts and the mostadventurous , whereas now is it leastof worth 
well may he be sorry that goeth from honour to shame , but never may he have reproach that shall do him ill , that cometh from shame to honour , for the honour wherein he is found rescueth him to god , but blame may never rescue the man that hath renounced honour for shame , for the shame and wickedness wherein he is found declare him guilty 
viii 
sir , saith king arthur , to amend me have i come hither , and to be better counselled than i have been 
well do i see that the place is mostholy , and i beseech you that you pray god that he counsel me and i will do my endeavour herein to amend me 
god grant you may amend your life , saith the holy hermit , in such sort that you may help to do away the evil law and to exalt the law that is made new by the crucifixion of the holy prophet 
a great sorrow is befallen in the land of late through a young knight that was harboured in the hostl of the rich king fisherman , for that the mostholy graal appeared to him and the lance whereof the point runneth of blood , yet never asked he to whom was served thereof nor whence it came , and for that he asked it not are all the lands commoved to war , nor no knight meeteth other in the forestbut he runneth upon him and slayeth him and he may , and you yourself shall well perceive thereof or ever you shall depart of this launde 
sir , saith king arthur , god defend me from the anguish of an evil death and from wickedness , for hither have i come for none other thing but to amend my life , and this will i do , so god bring me back in safety 
truly , saith the hermit , he that hath been bad for three years out of forty , he hath not been wholly good 
sir , saith the king , you speak truth 
the hermit departeth and so commendeth him to god 
the king cometh to his horse and mounteth the speediestthat ever he may , and setteth his shield on his neck , and taketh his spear in his hand and turneth him back a great pace 
howbeit , he had not gone a bowshot s length when he saw a knight coming disorderly againsthim , and he sate upon a great black horse and he had a shield of the same and a spear 
the spear was somewhat thick near the point and burned with a great flame , foul and hideous , and the flame came down as far as over the knight s fist  he setteth his spear in restand thinketh to smite the king , but the king swerveth aside and the other passeth beyond 
sir knight , wherefor hate you me 
of right ought i not to love you , saith the knight 
wherefore 
saith the king 
for this , that you have had my brother s candlestck that was foully stlen from him 
know you then who i am 
saith the king 
yea , saith the knight 
you are the king arthur that aforetime were good and now are evil 
wherefore i defy you as my mortal enemy 
he drweth him back so that his onset may be the weightier 
the king seeth that he may not depart without a stur 
he setteth his spear in restwhen he seeth the other come towards him with his own spear all burning 
the king smiteth his horse with his spurs as hard as he may , and meeteth the knight with his spear and the knight him 
they melled together so stutly that the spears bent without breaking , and both twain are shifted in their saddles and lose their strrups 
they hurtle so stongly either againstother of their bodies and their horses that their eyes sparkle as of strs in their heads and the blood rayeth out of king arthur by mouth and nose 
either drweth away from other and they take their breath 
the king looketh at the black knight s spear that burneth , and marvelleth him right sore that it is not snapped in flinders of the great buffet he had received thereof , and him thinketh rather that it is a devil and a fiend 
the black knight is not minded to let king arthur go so soon , but rather cometh toward him a great career 
the king seeth him come toward him and so covereth him of his shield for fear of the flame 
the king receiveth him on the point of his spear and smiteth him with so sore a shock that he maketh him bend backward over his horse croup 
the other , that was of great might , leapeth back into the saddlebows and smiteth the king upon the boss of his shield so that the burning point pierceth the shield and the sleeve of his habergeon and runneth the sharp iron into his arm 
the king feeleth the wound and the heat , whereof is he filled with great wrath , and the knight drweth back his spear to him , and hath great joy at heart when he feeleth the king wounded 
the king was rejoiced not a whit , and looked at the spear that was quenched thereof and burned no longer 
sir , saith the knight ,i cry you mercy 
never would my spear have been quenched of its burning , save it were bathed in your blood 
now may never god help me , saith king arthur , whenever i shall have mercy on you , and i may achieve 
he pricketh towards him a great run , and smiteth him in the broad of the breastand thrustd his spear half an ell into his body , and beareth him to the ground , both him and his horse all in a heap , and drweth his spear back to him and looketh at the knight that lay as dead and leaveth him in the launde , and drweth him towards the issue incontinent 
so as the king went , he heard a great clashing of knights coming right amidstthe forest so as it seemed there were a good score or more of them , and he seeth them enter the launde from the forest armed and well horsed 
they come with great ado toward the knight that lay dead in the midstof the launde 
king arthur was about to issue forth , when the damsel that he had left under the tree cometh forward to meet him 
sir , saith she , for god s sake , return back and fetch me the head of the knight that lieth there dead 
the king looketh back , and seeth the great peril and the multitude of knights that are there all armed 
ha , damsel , saith he , you are minded to slay me 
certes , sir , that i am not , but sore need will there be that i should have it , nor never did knight refuse to do the thing i asked nor deny me any boon i demanded of him 
now god grant you be not the mostchurlish 
ha , damsel , i am right sore wounded in the arm whereon i hold my shield 
sir , saith she , i know it well , nor never may you be heal thereof save you bring me the head of the knight 
damsel , he saith , i will essay it whatsoever may befal me thereof 
ix 
king arthur looketh amidstthe launde and seeth that they that have come thither have cut the knight to pieces limb by limb , and that each is carrying off a foot or a thigh or an arm or a hand and are dispersing them through the forest  and he seeth that the lastknight beareth on the point of his spear the head 
the king goeth after him a great gallop and crieth out to him  ha , sir knight , abide and speak to me 
what is your pleasure 
saith the knight 
fair sir , saith the king , i beseech you of all loves that you deign to give me the head of this knight that you are carrying on the point of your lance 
i will give it you , saith the knight , on condition 
what condition 
saith the king 
that you tell me who slew the knight whose head i carry that you ask of me 
may i not otherwise have it 
saith the king 
in no wise , saith he 
will i tell you , saith the king 
know of a very truth that king arthur slew him 
where is he 
saith the knight 
seek him until you shall have found him , saith king arthur , for i have told you the truth thereof 
give me the head 
willingly , saith the knight 
he lowereth his spear and the king taketh the head 
the knight had a horn at his neck 
he setteth it to his mouth and soundeth a blastright loud 
the knights that were set within the foresthear the horn and return back a great gallop , and king arthur goeth his way toward the oaktree at the issue of the launde where the damsel is awaiting him 
the knights come presently to him that had given the head to the king and ask him wherefore he hath sounded the horn 
for this , saith he , that this knight that is going away yonder hath told me that king arthur slew the black knight , and i was minded you should know it that we may follow him 
we will not follow him , say the knights , for it is king arthur himself that is carrying off the head , and no power have we to do evil to him nor other sith that he hath passed the bar 
you shall aby it that let him go when he was so nigh you 
they rush in upon him and slay him and cut him up , and each one carrieth off his piece the same as they had done with the other 
king arthur is issued forth of the bar , and cometh to the maiden that is waiting for him and presenteth her the head 
sir , saith the damsel , gramercy 
damsel , saith he , with a good will 
sir , saith the damsel , you may well alight , for nought have you to fear on this side the bar 
with that , the king alighteth 
sir , saith she , do off your habergeon heedfully and i will bind up the wound in your arm , for of none may you be made whole save of me only 
the king doeth off his habergeon , and the damsel taketh of the blood of the knight s head that stll ran all warm , and therewith washeth king arthur his wound , and thereafter maketh him do on his habergeon again 
sir , saith she , never would you have been whole save by the blood of this black knight 
for this carried they off the body piecemeal and the head , for that they well knew you were wounded 
of the head shall i have right sore need , for thereby shall a caste be yielded up to me that was reft from me by treason , so i may find the knight that i go seek , through whom it ought to be yielded up to me 
damsel , saith the king , and who is the knight 
sir , saith she , he was the son of alain li gros of the valleys of camelot , and is named perlesvax 
wherefore perlesvax 
saith the king 
sir , saith she , when he was born , his father was asked how he should be named in right baptism , and he said that he would he should have the name perlesvax , for the lord of the moors had reft him of the greater part of the valleys of camelot , and therefore he would that his son should by this name be reminded thereof , and god should so multiply him as that he should be knight 
the lad was right comely and right gentle and began to go by the forest and launch his javelins , welshfashion , at hart and hind 
his father and his mother loved him much , and one day they were come forth of their hold , whereunto the forestwas close anigh , to enjoy them 
now , there was between the hold and the forest an exceeding small chapel that stod upon four columns of marble 
it was roofed of timber and had a little altar within , and before the altar a right fair coffin , and thereupon was the figure of a man graven 
sir , saith the damsel to the king , the lad asked his father and mother what man lay within the coffin 
the father answered  `fair son ,  saith he , `certes , i know not to tell you , for the tomb hath been here or ever that my father s father was born , and never have i heard tell of none that might know who it is therein , save only that the letters that are on the coffin say that when the bestknight in the world shall come hither the coffin will open and the joinings all fall asunder , and then will it be seen who it is that lieth therein 
x 
damsel , saith the king , have many knights passed thereby sithence that the coffin was set there 
yea , sir , so many that neither i nor none other may tell the number 
yet natheless hath not the coffin removed itself for none 
when the lad heareth his father and mother talking thus , he asketh what a knight may be 
`fair son ,  saith his mother , `of right ought you well to know by your lineage 
she telleth the lad that he had eleven uncles on his father s side that had all been slain in arms , and not one of them lived knight but twelve years 
sir , saith she to the king , the lad made answer that this was nor that he had asked , but how knights were made 
the father answered that they were such as had more valour than any other in the world 
after that he said , `fair son , they are clad in habergeons of iron to protect their bodies , and helms laced upon their heads , and shields and spears and swords girded wherewithal to defend their bodies 
xi 
sir , saith the damsel to the king , when that the father had thus spoken to the lad , they returned together to the caste 
when the morrow morning came , the lad arose and heard the birds sing and bethought him that he would go for disport into the forestfor the day sith that it was fair 
he mounted on one of his father s horses of the chase and carried his javelins welshmanfashion and went into the forestand found a stg and followed him a good four leagues welsh , until that he came into a launde and found two knights all armed that were there doing battle , and the one had a red shield and the other a white 
he left of tracking the stg to look on at the melly and saw that the red knight was conquering the white 
he launched one of his javelins at the red knight so hard that he pierced his habergeon and made it pass through the heart 
the knight fell dead 
sir , saith the damsel , the knight of the white shield made great joy thereof , and the lad asked him , `were knights so easy to slay 
methought ,  saith the lad , `that none might never pierce nor damage a knight s armour , otherwise would i not have run him through with my javelin ,  saith the lad 
sir , the lad brought the destier home to his father and mother , and right grieved were they when they heard the tidings of the knight he had slain 
right were they , for thereof did sore trouble come to them thereafter 
sir , the squire departed from the house of his father and mother and came to the court of king arthur 
right gladly did the king make him knight when he knew his will , and afterward he departed from the land and went to seek adventure in every kingdom 
now is he the bestknight that is in the world 
go i to seek him , and full great joy shall i have at heart and i may find him 
sir , and you should meet him by any adventure in any of these forest , he beareth a red shield with a white hart 
so tell him that his father is dead , and that his mother will lose all her land so he come not to succour her 
that the brother of the knight of the red shield that he slew in the forestwith his javelin warreth upon her with the lord of the moors 
damsel , saith the king , and god grant me to meet him , right fain shall i be thereof , and right well will i set forth your message 
sir , saith she , now that i have told you him that i seek , it is your turn to tell me your name 
damsel , saith the king , willingly 
they that know me call me arthur 
arthur 
have you indeed such name 
yea , damsel , saith he 
help me god , saith she , now am i sorrier for you than tofore , for you have the name of the worstking in the world , and i would that he were here in such sort as you are now 
never again will he move from cardoil , do what he may , such drad hath the queen lestany should take him from her , according as i have heard witness , for never saw i neither the one nor the other 
i was moved to go to his court , but i have met full a score knights one after other , of whom i asked concerning him , and one told me the same tale as another , for each told me that the court of king arthur is the vilestin the world , and that all the knights of the table round have renounced it for the badness thereof 
damsel , saith the king , hereof may he well be sorry , but at the beginning i have heard say he did right well 
who careth , saith the damsel , for his good beginning when the end is bad 
much it misliketh me that so seemly knight and so worshipful man as are you should have the name of so evil a king 
damsel , saith the king , a man is not good by his name , but by his heart 
you say true , saith the damsel , but for the king s name have i despite of yours 
whitherward are you going 
i shall go to cardoil , where i shall find king arthur when i shall come thither 
go to , then , and bestr 
saith she 
one bad man with another 
no better hope have i of you , sith that you go thither 
damsel , you may say your pleasure , for thither i go 
god be with you 
may never god guide you , saith she , and you go the court of king arthur 
xii 
with that the king mounted again and departed , and left the damsel under the tree and entered into the deep forestand rode with much ado as fastas he might to come to cardoil 
he had ridden a good ten leagues welsh when he heard a voice in the thick of the forestthat began to cry aloud  king arthur of great britain , right glad at heart maystthou be of this that god hath sent me hither unto thee 
so he biddeth thee that thou hold court at the earliestthou mayst for the world , that is now made worse of thee and of thy slackness in welldoing , shall thereof be greatly amended 
with that the voice is silent , and the king was right joyous in his heart of that he had heard 
the stry speaketh no more here of other adventure that befel king arthur in his returning nor on his arriving 
anyway , he hath ridden so long that he is come back to cardoil 
the queen and the knights made great feastof him and great joy 
the king was alighted on the mountingstge and went up into the hall and made him be disarmed 
he showed the queen the wound that he had on his arm , that had been right great and painful , but it was healing full fairly 
the king goeth into the chamber and the queen with him , and doeth the king be apparelled in a robe of cloth of silk all furred of ermine , with coat , surcoat and mantle 
sir , saith the queen , sore pain and travail have you had 
lady , in such wise behoveth worshipful man to suffer in order that he may have honour , for hardly shall none without travail come to honour 
he recounteth to the queen all the adventures that have befallen him sithence that he was departed , and in what manner he was wounded in the arm , and of the damsel that had so blamed him of his name 
sir , saith the queen , now may you well know how meet it is that a man high and rich and puissant should have great shame of himself when he becometh evil 
lady , saith the king , so much did the damsel do me well to wot , but greatly did a voice recomfort me that i heard in the forest for it told me that god bade me hold court presently , and that i shall see there the fairestadventure befal that ever i may see 
sir , saith she , right joyous ought you to be that your saviour hath had you in remembrance 
now , therefore , fulfil his commandment 
certes , lady , so will i do 
for never had none better desire of welldoing than have i as at this time , nor of honour nor of largesse 
sir , saith she , god be praised thereof 
branch ii 
now beginneth here the second branch of the holy graal the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i king arthur was at cardoil with the queen and right few knights 
by god s pleasure , the wish and the will had come back to him to win honour and to do largesse as mosthe might 
he made seal his letters and sent them throughout all his lands and all the islands , and gave notice to the barons and knights that he would hold court at pannenoisance , that is situate the sea of wales , at the feastof s 
john after whitsuntide 
he was minded to put it off until that day , for that suntide was already too nigh , and they that should be thereat might not all come by the earlier day 
the tidings went through all lands , so that knights come in great plenty thereunto , for welldoing had so waxed feeble in all the kingdoms , that every one had avoided king arthur as one that should do nought more for ever 
wherefore all began now to marvel whence his new desire had come 
the knights of the table round that were scattered through the lands and the forest , by god s will learnt the tidings and right great joy had they thereof , and came back to the court with great ado 
neither messire gawain nor lancelot came thither on that day 
all the other came that were then on live 
s 
john s day came , and the knights were come from all parts , marvelling much that the king had not held the court at whitsuntide , but they knew not the occasion thereof 
the day was fair and clear and the air fresh , and the hall was wide and high and garnished of good knights in great plenty 
the cloths were spread on the tables whereof were great plenty in the hall 
the king and the queen had washen and went to sit at the head of one table and the other knights sate them down , whereof were full five score and five as the stry telleth 
kay the seneschal and messire ywain the son of king urien served that day at the tables at meat , and fiveandtwenty knights beside 
lucan the butler served the golden cup before the king 
the sun shone through the windows everywhere amidstthe hall that was stown of flowers and rushes and sweet herbs and gave out a smell like as had it been sprinkled of balm 
staightway after the firstmeat had been served , and while they were yet awaiting the second , behold you three damsels where they enter into the hall 
she that came firstsate upon a mule white as drven snow and had a golden bridle and a saddle with a bow of ivory banded with precious stnes and a saddlecloth of a red samite drpped of gold 
the damsel that was seated on the mule was right seemly of body but scarce so fair of face , and she was robed in a rich cloth of silk and gold and had a right rich hat that covered all her head 
it was all loaded of costy stnes that flamed like fire 
great need had she that her head were covered , for she was all bald without hair , and carried on her neck her right arm slung in a stle of cloth of gold 
her arm lay on a pillow , the richestthat ever might be seen , and it was all charged of little golden bells , and in this hand held she the head of a king sealed in silver and crowned with gold 
the other damsel that came behind rode after the fashion of a squire , and carried a pack trussed behind her with a brachet thereupon , and at her neck she bore a shield banded argent and azure with a red cross , and the boss was of gold all set with precious stnes 
the third damsel came afoot with her kirtle tucked up like a running footman 
she had in her hand a whip wherewith she drve the two steds 
each of these twain was fairer than the first but the one afoot surpassed both the others in beauty 
the firstcometh before the king , there where he sitteth at meat with the queen 
sir , saith she , the saviour of the world grant you honour and joy and good adventure and my lady the queen and all them of this hall for love of you 
hold it not churlishness and i alight not , for there where knights be may i not alight , nor ought i until such time as the graal be achieved 
damsel , saith the king , gladly would i have it so 
sir , saith she , that know i well , and may it not mislike you to hear the errand whereon i am come , it shall not mislike me , saith the king , say your pleasure 
sir , saith she , the shield that this damsel beareth belonged to joseph , the good soldier knight that took down our lord of hanging on the rood 
i make you a present thereof in such wise as i shall tell you , to wit , that you keep the shield for a knight that shall come hither for the same , and you shall make hang it on this column in the midstof your hall , and guard it in such wise as that none may take it and hang at his neck save he only 
of this shield shall he achieve the graal , and another shield shall he leave here in the hall , red , with a white hart 
the brachet that the damsel carrieth shall here remain , and little joy will the brachet make until the knight shall come 
damsel , saith the king , the shield and the brachet will we keep full safely , and right heartily we thank you that you have deigned to bring them hither 
sir , saith the damsel , i have not yet told you all that i have in charge to deliver 
the bestking that liveth on earth and the mostloyal and the mostrighteous , sendeth you greeting 
of whom is sore sorrow for that he hath fallen into a grievous languishment 
damsel , saith the king , sore pity is it and it be so as you say 
i pray you tell me who is the king 
sir , saith she , it is rich king fisherman , of whom is great grief 
damsel , saith the king , you say true 
god grant him his heart s desire 
sir , saith she , know you wherefore he hath fallen into languishment 
nay , i know not at all , but gladly would i learn 
i will tell you , saith she 
this languishment is come upon him through one that harboured in his hostl , to whom the mostholy graal appeared 
for that he would not ask unto whom one served thereof , were all the lands commoved to war thereby , nor never thereafter might knight meet other but he should fight with him in arms without none other occasion 
you yourself may well perceive the same , for your welldoing hath greatly slackened , whereof have you had much blame , and all the other barons that by you have taken ensample , for you are the mirror of the world alike in welldoing and in evildoing 
sir , i myself have good right to plain me of the knight , and i will show you wherefore 
she lifteth the rich hat from her head and showeth the king and queen and the knights in the hall her head all bald without hair 
sir , saith she , my head was right seemly garnished of hair plaited in rich tresses of gold at such time as the knight came to the hostl of the rich king fisherman , but i became bald for that he made not the demand , nor never again shall i have my hair until such time as a knight shall go thither that shall ask the queston better than did he , or the knight that shall achieve the graal 
sir , even yet have you not seen the sore mischief that hath befallen thereof 
there is without this hall a car that three white harts have drwn hither , and lightly may you send to see how rich it is 
i tell you that the traces are of silk and the axletrees of gold , and the timber of the car is ebony 
the car is covered above with a black samite , and below is a cross of gold the whole length , and under the coverlid of the car are the heads of an hundrd and fifty knights whereof some be sealed in gold , other some in silver and the third in lead 
king fisherman sendeth you word that this loss i hath befallen of him that demanded not unto whom one serveth of the graal 
sir , the damsel that beareth the shield holdeth in her hand the head of a queen that is sealed in lead and crowned with copper , and i tell you that by the queen whose head you here behold was the king betrayed whose head i bear , and the three manner of knights whose heads are within the car 
sir , send without to see the costiness and fashion of the car 
the king sent kay the seneschal to see 
he looked staitly thereat within and without and thereafter returned to the king 
sir , saith he , never beheld i car so rich , and there be three harts withal that drw the car , the tallestand fattestone might ever see 
and you will be guided by me , you will take the foremost for he is scarce so far , and so might you bid make right good collops thereof 
avoid there , kay 
saith the king 
foul churlishness have you spoken 
i would not such a deed were done for another such kingdom as is this of logres 
sir , saith the damsel , he that hath been wont to do churlishness doth right grudgingly withdrw himself therefrom 
messire kay may say whatsoever him pleaseth , but well know i that you will pay no heed to his talk 
sir , saith the damsel , command that the shield be hung on this column and that the brachet be put in the queen s chamber with the maidens 
we will go on our way , for here have we been long enough 
messire ywain laid hold on the shield and took it off the damsel s neck by leave of the king , and hung it on the column in the midstof the hall , and one of the queen s maidens taketh the brachet and carrieth him to the queen s chamber 
the damsel taketh her leave and turneth again , and the king commendeth her to god 
when the king eaten in hall , the queen with the king and the knights go to lean at the windows to look at the three damsels and the three white harts that drw the car , and the more part said that the damsel afoot that went after the two that were mounted should have the mostmisease 
the bald damsel went before , and set not her hat on her head until such time as behoved her enter into the forest and the knights that were at the windows might see them no longer 
set she her hat again upon her head 
the king , the queen , and the knights when they might see them no more , came down from the windows , and certain of them said that never until this time had they seen baldheaded damsel save this one only 
ii 
hereupon the stry is silent of king arthur , and turneth again to speak of the three damsels and the car that was drwn by the three white harts 
they are entered into the forestand ride on right busily 
when they had left the caste some seven leagues welsh behind them , they saw a knight coming toward them on the way they had to go 
the knight sat on a tall horse , lean and bony 
his habergeon was all rust and his shield pierced in more than a dozen places , and the colour thereon was so fretted away that none might make out the cognizance thereof 
a right thick spear bore he in his hand 
when he came anigh the damsel , he saluted her right nobly 
fair welcome , damsel , to you and your company 
sir , saith she , god grant you joy and good adventure 
damsel , saith the knight , whence come you 
sir , from a court highplenary that king arthur holdeth at pannenoisance 
go you thither , sir knight , saith the damsel , to see the king and the queen and the knights that are there 
nay , not so 
saith he 
many a time have i seen them , but right glad am i of king arthur that he hath again taken up his welldoing , for many a time hath he been accustmed thereof 
whitherward have you now emprised your way 
saith the damsel 
to the land of king fisherman , and god allow me 
sir , saith she , tell me your name and bide awhile beside me 
the knight drweth bridle and the damsels and the car come to a sty 
damsel , saith he , well behoveth me tell you my name 
messire gawain am i called , king arthur s nephew 
what 
are you messire gawain 
my heart well told me as much 
yea , damsel , saith he , gawain am i 
god be praised thereof , for so good knight as are you may well go see the rich king fisherman 
now am i fain to pray you of the valour that is in you and the courtesy , that you return with me and convoy me beyond a certain caste that is in this forestwhereof is some small peril 
damsel , saith messire gawain , willingly , at your pleasure 
he returneth with the damsel through the midstof the forestthat was tall and leafy and little haunted of folk 
the damsel relateth to him the adventure of the heads that she carried and that were in the car , like as she did at the court of king arthur , and of the shield and the brachet she had left there , but much it misliked messire gawain of the damsel that was afoot behind them 
damsel ,  saith messire gawain , wherefore doth not this damsel that goeth afoot mount upon the car 
sir , saith she , this shall she not , for behoveth her go not otherwise than afoot 
and you be so good knight as men say , betimes will she have done her penance 
how so 
saith gawain 
i will tell you , saith she 
it shall so be that god bring you to the hostl of rich king fisherman , and the mostholy graal appear before you and you demand unto whom is served thereof , then will she have done her penance , and i , that am bald , shall receive again my hair 
so you also make not demand thereof , then will it behove us suffer sore annoy until such time as the good knight shall come and shall have achieved the graal 
for on account of him that firstwas there and made not the demand , are all the lands in sorrow and warfare , and the good king fisherman is yet in languishment 
damsel , saith messire gawain , god grant me courage and will herein that i may come to do this thing according to your wish , whereof may i win worship both of god and of the world 
iii 
messire gawain and the damsels go on their way a great pace through the high forest green and leafy , where the birds are singing , and enter into the mosthideous forestand mosthorrible that any might ever see , and seemed it that no greenery never there had been , so bare and dr were all the branches and all the trees black and burnt as it had been by fire , and the ground all parched and black atop with no green , and full of great cracks 
damsel , saith messire gawain , right loathly is this forestand right hideous 
goeth it on far like this 
sir 
saith she , for nine leagues welsh goeth it on the same , but we shall pass not through the whole thereof 
messire gawain 1ooketh from time to time on the damsel that cometh arbor , and sore it irketh him that he may not amend her estte 
they ride on until that they come to a great valley and messire gawain looketh along the bottom and seeth appear a black caste that was enclosed within a girdle of wall , foul and evilseeming 
the nigher he drweth to the caste the more hideous it seemeth him , and he seeth great halls appear that were right foully misshapen , and the forestabout it he seeth to be like as he had found it behind 
he seeth a water come down from the head of a mountain , foul and horrible and black , that went amidstthe caste roaring so loud that it seemed to be thunder 
messire gawain seeth the entrance of the gateway foul and horrible like as it had been hell , and within the caste heard he great outcries and lamentations , and the mostpart heard he saying  ha , god 
what hath become of the good knight , and when will he come 
damsel , saith messire gawain , what is this caste here that is so foul and hideous , wherein is such dolour suffered and such weary longing for the coming of the good knight 
sir , this is the caste of the black hermit 
wherefore am i fain to pray you that you meddle not herein for nought that they within may do to me , for otherwise it may well be that your death is at hand , for againstthem will you have no might nor power 
they come anigh the caste as it were a couple of bowshots , and behold , through the gateway come knights armed on black horses and their arms all black and their shields and spears , and there were a hundrd and fifty and two , right parlous to behold 
they come a great gallop toward the damsel , and toward the car , and take the hundrd and fiftytwo heads , each one his own , and set them upon their spears and so enter into the caste again with great joy 
messire gawain seeth the insolence that the knights have wrought , and right great shame hath he of himself that he hath not moved withal 
messire gawain , saith the damsel , now may you know how little would your force have availed you herein 
damsel , an evil caste is this where folk are robbed on such wise 
sir , never may this mischief be amended , nor this outrage be done away , nor the evildoer therein be sticken down , nor they that cry and lament within the prison there be set free until such time as the good knight shall come for whom are they yearning as you have heard but now 
damsel , right glad may the knight be that by his valour and his hardiment shall destoy so many evil folk 
sir , therefore is he the bestknight in the world , and he is yet young enough of age , but right sorrowful am i at heart that i know not true tidings of him 
for better will have i to see him than any man on live 
damsel , so also have i , saith messire gawain , for then by your leave would i turn me again 
not so , sir , but and you shall come beyond i the caste , then will i teach you the way whereby you ought to go 
iv 
with that they go toward the caste all together 
justas they were about to pass beyond the caste wall , behold you where a knight cometh forth of a privy postrn of the caste , and he was sitting upon a tall horse , his spear in his fist and at his neck had he a red shield whereon was figured a golden eagle 
sir knight , saith he to messire gawain , i pray you bide 
what is your pleasure 
you mustneeds joustwith me , saith he and conquer this shield , or otherwise i shall conquer you 
full precious is the shield , insomuch as that great pains ought you to take to have it and conquer it , for it belonged to the bestknight of his faith that was ever , and the mostpuissant and the wisest who , then , was he 
saith messire gawain 
judas machabee was he , and he it was that firstwrought how by one bird to take another 
you say true , saith messire gawain 
a good knight was he 
therefore right joyful may you be , saith he , and you may conquer the same , for your own is the poorestand mostbattered that ever saw i borne by knight 
for hardly may a man know the colour thereof 
thereby may you well see , saith the damsel to the knight , that his own shield hath not been idle , nor hath the horse whereon he sitteth been stbled so well as yours 
damsel , saith the knight , no need is here of long pleading 
needs musthe joustwith me , for him do i defy 
saith messire gawain , i hear well that you say 
he drweth him back and taketh his career and the knight likewise , and they come together as fastas their horses may carry them , spear in rest  the knight smiteth messire gawain on the shield whereof he had no great defence , and passeth beyond , and in the bypass the knight tobrake his spear 
messire gawain smiteth him with his spear in the midstof his breastand beareth him to the ground over the croup of his horse , all pinned upon his spear , whereof he had a good full hand s breadth in his breast  he drweth his spear back to him , and when the knight felt himself unpinned , he leaped to his feet and came staight to his horse and would fain set his foot in the strrup when the damsel of the car crieth out  messire gawain , hinder the knight 
for and he were mounted again , too sore travail would it be to conquer him 
when the knight heard name messire gawain , he drweth him back  how 
saith he 
is this then the good gawain , king arthur s nephew 
yea , saith the damsel , he it is without fail 
sir , saith the knight to messire gawain , are you he 
yea , saith he , gawain i am 
sir , so please you , saith he , i hold me conquered , and right sorry am i that i knew you not or ever i had ado with you 
he taketh the shield from his neck and holdeth it to him 
sir , saith he , take the shield that belonged to the bestknight that was in his time of his faith , for none know i of whom it shall be better employed than of you 
of this shield were vanquished all they that be in prison in this caste 
messire gawain taketh the shield that was right fair and rich 
sir , saith the knight , now give me yours , for you will not bear two shields 
you say true , saith messire gawain 
he taketh the guige from his neck and would have given him the shield , when the damsel afoot  hold , sir knight , you that are named messire gawain 
what would you do 
he bear your shield into the caste there , they of the caste will hold you recreant and conquered , and will come forth thence and carry you into the caste by force , and there will you be castinto his grievous prison 
for no shield is borne thereinto save of a vanquished knight only 
sir knight , saith messire gawain , no good you wish me , according to that this damsel saith 
sir , saith the knight , i cry you mercy , and a second time i hold me conquered , and right glad should i have been might i have borne your shield within yonder , and right great worship should i have had thereof , for never yet hath entered there the shield of knight so good 
now ought i to be right well pleased of your coming , sith that you have set me free of the soresttrouble that ever knight had 
what is the trouble 
saith messire gawain 
sir , saith he , i will tell you 
heretofore many a time hath there been a passing by of knights both of hardy and of coward , and it was my business to contend and joustwith them and do battle , and i made them present of the shield as did i you 
the more part found i hardy and well able to defend themselves , that wounded me in many places , but never was knight so felled me to the ground nor dealt me so sore a buffet as have you 
sith that you are carrying away the shield and i am conquered , never hereafter shall knight that passeth before this caste have no drad of me nor of no knight that is herein 
by my head , saith messire gawain , now am i gladder of my conquestthan i was before 
sir , saith the knight , by your leave will i go my way , for , and i may hide not my shame in the caste , needs musti show it openly abroad 
god grant you do well 
saith messire gawain 
messire gawain , saith the damsel of the car , give me your shield that the knight would fain have carried off 
willingly , damsel , saith he 
the damsel that went afoot taketh the shield and setteth it in the car 
howbeit , the knight that was conquered mounted again upon his horse , and entered again into the caste , and when he was come thereinto , arose a noise and great outcry so loud that all the forestand all the valley began to resound thereof 
messire gawain , saith the damsel of the car , the knight is shamed and there castin prison another time 
now hast , messire gawain 
for now may you go 
with that they all set forward again upon their way together , and leave the caste an english league behind 
damsel , saith messire gawain , when it shall please you , i shall have your leave to go 
sir , saith she , god be guard of your body , and right great thanks of your convoy 
lady , saith he , my service is always ready at your command 
sir , saith the damsel , gramercy , and your own way see you there by yonder great cross at the entrance of yonder forest  and beyond that , will you find the fairestforestand mostdelightsome when you shall have passed through this that sore is wearisome 
messire gawain turneth him to go , and the damsel afoot crieth out to him  sir , not so heedful are you as i supposed 
messire gawain turneth his horse s head as he that was strtled  wherefore say you so , damsel 
saith he 
for this , saith she , that you have never asked of my damsel wherefore she carrieth her arm slung at her neck in this golden stle , nor what may be the rich pillow whereon the arm lieth 
no greater heed will you take at the court of the rich king fisherman 
sweet , my friend , saith the damsel of the car , blame not messire gawain only , but king arthur before him and all the knights that were in the court 
for not one of them all that were there was so heedful as to ask me 
go your ways , messire gawain , for in vain would you now demand it , for i will tell you not , nor shall you never know it save only by the mostcoward knight in the world , that is mine own knight and goeth to seek me and knoweth not where to find me 
damsel , saith messire gawain , i durstnot press you further 
with that the damsel departeth , and messire gawain setteth him forward again on the way that she had taught him 
branch iii 
incipit 
here beginneth another branch of the graal in the name of the father , and in the name of the son , and in the name of the holy ghost title i here is the stry silent of the three damsels and the car and saith that messire gawain hath passed throughout the evil forestand is entered into the forestpassing fair , the broad , the high , the plenteous of venison 
he rideth a great pace , but sore abashed is he of that the damsel had said to him , and misdoubteth him but he shall have blame thereof in many places 
he rode hard the day long till that it was evensong and the sun was about to set 
he looketh before him and seeth the house of a hermit and the chapel in the thick of the forest and a spring flowed forth in front of the chapel right clear and fresh , and above it was a tree full broad and tall that threw a shadow over the spring 
a damsel sate under the tree and held a mule by the reins and at the saddlebow had she the head of a knight hanging 
messire gawain cometh thitherward and alighteth 
damsel , saith he , god give you good adventure 
sir , saith she , and you always 
when she was risen up over againsthim , damsel , saith he , for whom are you awaiting here 
sir , saith she , i am waiting for the hermit of this holy chapel , that is gone into the forest and i would fain ask him tidings of a knight 
think you he will tell you them and he knoweth any 
yea , sir , i think so , according to that i have been told 
therewithal behold you the hermit that was coming , and saluteth the damsel and messire gawain and openeth the door of the house and setteth the two steds within and stiketh off the bridles and giveth them greenmeat firstand barley after , and fain would he have taken off the saddles when messire gawain leapeth before  sir , saith he , do not so 
this business is not for you 
hermit though i be , saith he , yet well know i how to deal withal , for at the court of king uther pendrgon have i been squire and knight twoscore years , and a score or mort have i been in this hermitage 
messire gawain looketh at him in wonderment 
sir , saith he , meseemeth you are not of more than forty years 
that know i well of a truth , saith the hermit , and messire gawain taketh off the saddles and bethinketh him more of the damsel s mule than of his own horse 
the hermit taketh messire gawain by the hand and the damsel and leadeth them into the chapel 
the place was right fair 
sir , saith the hermit to messire gawain , you will disarm you not , saith he , for this forestis passing adventurous , and no worshipful man behoveth be disgarnished 
he goeth for his spear and for his shield and setteth them within the chapel 
he setteth before them such meat as he hath , and when they have eaten giveth them to drnk of the spring 
sir , saith the damsel , of a knight that i go seek am i come to ask you tidings 
who is the knight 
saith the hermit 
sir , he is the chast knight of mostholy lineage 
he hath a heart of gold , the look of a lion , the navel of a virgin maid , a heart of stel , the body of an elephant , and without wickedness are all his conditions 
damsel , saith the hermit , nought will i tell you concerning him , for i know not of a certainty where he is , save this , that he hath lain in this chapel twice , not once only , within this twelvemonth 
sir , saith she , will you tell me no more of him , nor none other witting 
in no wise , saith the hermit 
you , messire gawain 
saith she 
damsel , saith he , as fainly would i see him as you , but none find i that may tell me tidings of him 
the damsel of the car , sir , have you seen her 
yea , lady , saith he , it is but justnow sithence that i left her 
carried she stll her arm slung at her neck 
yea , saith messire gawain , in such wise she carried it 
of a long while , saith the damsel , hath she borne it thus 
sir , saith the hermit , how are you named 
sir , saith he , gawain am i called , king arthur s nephew 
thereof i love you the better , saith the hermit 
sir , saith the damsel , you are of kindrd to the worstking that is 
of what king speak you 
saith messire gawain 
i speak , saith she , of king arthur , through whom is all the world made worser , for he began doing well and now hath become evil 
for hatred of him hate i a knight that found me nigh s 
augustne s chapel , and yet was he the comeliestknight that saw i ever 
he slew a knight within the bar right hardily 
i asked him for the head of the knight and he went back for the same and set himself in sore peril 
he brought it me , and i made him great joy , but when he told me his name was arthur i had no fainness of the bounty he had done me , for that he had the name of that evil king 
ii 
damsel , saith messire gawain , you may say your pleasure 
i tell you that king arthur hath held the richestcourt that he hath held ever , and these evil conditions whereof you blame him is he minded to put away for evermore , and more will he do of good and more of largesse than was ever known aforetime so long as he shall live 
nor know i none other knight that beareth his name 
you are right , saith the damsel , to come to his rescue , for that he is your uncle , but your rescue will scarce avail him and he deliver not himself 
sir , saith the hermit to messire gawain , the damsel will say her pleasure 
may god defend king arthur , for his father made me knight 
now am i priest and in this hermitage ever sithence that i came hither have i served king fisherman by the will of our lord and his commandment , and all they that serve him do well partake of his reward , for the place of his mostholy service is a refuge so sweet that unto him that hath been there a year , it seemeth to have been but a month for the holiness of the place and of himself , and for the sweetness of his caste wherein have i oftentimes done service in the chapel where the holy graal appeareth 
therefore is it that i and all that serve him are so youthful of seeming 
sir , saith messire gawain , by what way may a man go to his caste 
sir , saith the hermit , none may teach you the way , save the will of god lead you therein 
would you fain go thither 
sir , saith messire gawain , it is the mostwish that i have 
sir , saith the hermit , now god give you grace and courage to ask the queston that the others to whom the graal hath appeared would ask not , whereof have many mischances sithence befallen much people 
iii 
with that , they left of talking , and the hermit led messire gawain into his house to rest and the damsel abode stll in the chapel 
on the morrow when dawn appeared , messire gawain that had lain all armed , arose and found his saddle ready and the damsel , and the bridles set on , and cometh to the chapel and findeth the hermit that was apparelled to sing mass , and seeth the damsel kneeling before an image of our lady , and she prayed god and the sweet lady that they would counsel her that whereof she had need , and wept right tenderly so that the tears ran down her face 
when she had prayed of a long space she ariseth , and messire gawain biddeth her god give her good day , and she returneth his salute 
damsel , saith he , meseemeth you are not over joyous 
sir , saith she , i have right , for now am i nigh unto my desolation , sith that i may not find the good knight 
now musti needs go to the caste of the black hermit , and bear thither the head that hangeth at my saddlebow , for otherwise shall i not be able to pass through the forestbut my body should there be castin prison or shamed , and this shall be the quittance for my passing 
will i seek the damsel of the car and so shall i go in safer through the forest with that the hermit had begun the mass and messire gawain and the damsel heard it 
when mass was sung , messire gawain took leave of the hermit and the damsel also 
messire gawain goeth one way and the damsel the other , and either biddeth other to god 
iv 
hereupon the stry is now silent of the damsel , and saith that messire gawain goeth through the high forestand rideth a great pace , and prayeth god right sweetly that he will set him in such way as that thereby he may go to the land of the rich king fisherman 
he rideth until the hour of noon , and cometh into the fulness of the forestand seeth under a tree a squire alighted of a horse of the chase 
messire gawain saluteth him , and the squire saith  sir , right welcome may you be 
fair sweet friend , saith messire gawain , whither go you 
sir , i go to seek the lord of this forest whose is the forest saith messire gawain 
sir , it belongeth to the bestknight in the world 
can you tell me tidings of him 
he ought to bear a shield banded azure and argent with a red cross thereon and a boss of gold 
i say that he is good knight , but little call have i to praise him , for he slew my father in this forestwith a javelin 
the good knight was squire what time he slew him , and fain would i avenge my father upon him and i may find him , for he reft me of the bestknight that was in the realm of logres when he slew my father 
well did he bereave me of him what time he slew him with his javelin without defiance , nor shall i never be at ease nor at restuntil i shall have avenged him 
fair sweet friend , saith messire gawain , sith that he is knight so good take heed you increase not your wrong of your own act , and i would fain that you had found him , so as that no evil had befallen him thereof 
v 
would not i , saith the squire , for never shall i see him in this place but i shall run upon him as my mortal enemy 
fair sweet friend , saith messire gawain , you may say your pleasure , but tell me is there no hold in this forestwherein i ú may harbour me the night 
sir , saith the squire , no hold know i within twenty league of your way in any quarter 
wherefore no leisure have you to tarry , for it is high noon already 
messire gawain saluteth the squire and goeth a great pace as he that knoweth neither highway nor byway save only as adventure may lead him 
the forestpleaseth him well for that it is so fair and that he seeth the deer pass by before him in great herds 
he rode on until it drw toward evensong at a corner of the forest  the evening was fair and calm and the sun was about to set 
a score league welsh had he ridden sithence that he parted from the squire , and sore he misdoubted him that he should find no hold 
he found the fairestmeadowland in the world , and looked before him when he had ridden a couple of bowshot lengths and saw a caste appear nigh the foreston a mountain 
it was enclosed of high walls with battlements , and within were fair halls whereof the windows showed in the outer walls , and in the midstwas an ancient tower that was compassed round of great waters and broad meadowlands 
thitherward messire gawain drweth him and looketh toward the gateway of the caste and seeth a squire issue forth a great pace upon a hackney , and he came the way that messire gawain was coming 
when the squire seeth him , and hath drwn somewhat anigh , he saluteth him right nobly 
vi 
sir , right welcome may you be 
good adventure may you have 
saith messire gawain 
fair sweet friend , what is this caste here , sir 
sir , it is the caste of the widow lady 
what is the name thereof 
camelot 
it belonged to alain li gros , that was a right loyal knight and worshipful man 
he is dead this long time , and my lady hath remained without succour and without counsel 
wherefore is the caste warred upon of them that would fain reave her thereof by force 
the lord of the moors and another knight are they that war upon her and would fain reave her of this caste as they have reft he of seven other already 
greatly desireth she the return of her son , for no counsel hath she save only of her one daughter and of five old knights that help her to guard the caste 
sir , saith he , the door is made fastand the bridge drwn up , for they guard the caste closely , but , so please you , you will tell me your name and i will go before and make the bridge be 1owered and the gate unfastned , and will say that you will lodge within tonight 
gramercy , saith messire gawain , right well shall my name be known or ever i depart from the caste 
the squire goeth his way a great pace , and messire gawain tided softly at a walk for he had yet a long way to go 
he found a chapel that stod between the forestand the caste , and it was builded upon four columns of marble and within was a right fair sepulchre 
the chapel had no fence of any kind about it so that he seeth the coffin within full clearly , and messire gawain bideth awhile to look thereon 
the squire entered into the caste and hath made the bridge be lowered and the door opened 
he alighteth and is come into the hall when was the widow lady and her daughter 
saith the lady to the squire  wherefore have you returned from doing my message 
lady , for the comeliestknight that i have seen ever , and fain would he harbour within tonight , and he is garnished of all arms and rideth without company 
what name hath he 
saith the lady 
lady , he told me you should know it well or ever he depart from this caste 
therewithal the lady gan weep for joy and her daughter also , and , lifting her hands towards heaven , fair lord god 
saith the widow lady , and this be indeed my son , never before have i had joy that might be likened to this 
now shall i not be disherited of mine honour , neither shall i lose my caste whereof they would fain reave me by wrong , for that no lord nor champion have i 
vii 
thereupon the widow lady ariseth up and her daughter likewise , and they go over the bridge of the caste and see messire gawain that was yet looking on the coffin within the chapel 
now hast 
saith the lady 
at the tomb shall we be well able to see whether it be he 
they go to the chapel right speedily , and messire gawain seeth them coming and alighteth 
lady , saith he , welcome may you be , you and your company 
the lady answereth never a word until that they are come to the tomb 
when she findeth it not open she falleth down in a swoon 
messire gawain is sore afraid when he seeth it 
the lady cometh back out of her swoon and breaketh out into great lamentation 
sir , saith the damsel to messire gawain , welcome may you be 
now sithence my mother supposed that you had been her son and made great joy thereof , and now seeth she plainly that you are not he , whereof is she sore sorrowful , for so soon as he shall return , this coffin behoveth open , nor until that hour shall none know who it is that lieth therein 
the lady riseth up and taketh messire gawain by the hand 
sir , saith she , what is your name 
lady , saith he , i am called gawain , king arthur s nephew 
sir , saith she , you shall be he that is welcome both for the sake of my son and for your own sake 
the lady biddeth a squire lead his horse into the caste and carry his shield and spear 
they enter into the caste and lead messire gawain into the hall , and make disarm him 
after that , they fetch him water to wash his hands and his face , for he was distined of the rustof his habergeon 
the lady maketh apparel him in a rich robe of silk and gold , and furred of ermine 
the widow lady cometh forth of her chamber and maketh messire gawain sit beside her 
sir , saith she , can you tell me any tidings of my son that i have not seen of this long time past and of whom at this present am i sore in need 
viii 
lady , saith he , no tidings of him know i to tell you , and right heavy am i thereof , for he is the knight of the world that fainesti would see and he be your son as i am told 
what name hath he 
sir , saith she , his name in right baptism is perceval , and a right comely squire was he when he departed hence 
now as at this time is it said that he is the comeliestknight on live and the mosthardy and the cleanestof all wickedness 
sore need have i of his hardiment , for what time that he departed hence he left me in the midstof a great warfare on behalf of the knight of the red shield that he slew 
within the se nnight thereafter he went away , nor never once have i seen him sithence , albeit a full seven year hath passed already 
now the brother of the knight that he slew and the lord of the moors are warring upon me and are fain to reave me of my caste and god counsel me not 
for my brothers are too far away from me , and king pelles of the lower folk hath renounced his land for god s sake and entered into a hermitage 
the king of caste mortal hath in him as much of wickedness and felony as these twain have in them of good , and enough thereof have they 
neither succour nor help may they give me , for the king of caste mortal challengeth my lord king fisherman both of the mostholy graal and of the lance whereof the point bleedeth every day , albeit god forbid he should ever have them 
ix 
lady , saith messire gawain , there was at the hostl of king fisherman a knight before whom the holy graal appeared three times , yet never once would he ask whereof it served nor whom it honoured 
sir , saith the widow lady s daughter , you say true , and the bestknight is he of the world 
this say i for love of my brother , and i love all knights for the love of him , but by the foolish wit of the knight hath mine uncle king fisherman fallen into languishment 
sir , saith the lady , behoveth all good knights go see the rich king fisherman 
will you not therefore go 
lady , saith messire gawain , yea , that will i , so speedily as i may , for not elsewhither have i emprised my way 
sir , saith she , then are you going to see my son , wherefore tell my son , and you see him , of mine evil plight and my misease , and king fisherman my brother 
take heed , messire gawain , that you be better mindful than was the knight 
lady , saith messire gawain , i shall do as god shall teach me 
in the meanwhile as they were speaking thus together , behold you therewithal the widow lady s five knights that were come in from the forestand make bring harts and hinds and wild swine 
they alighted and made great joy of messire gawain when they knew who he was 
x 
when the meat was ready they sate to eat , and full plenteously were they provided and right well were they served 
thereupon , behold , cometh the squire that had opened the door for messire gawain , and kneeleth before the widow lady 
what tidings 
saith she 
lady , there is to be a right great assembly of tourney in the valleys that aforetime were ours 
already have they spread the welsh booths , and thither are come these two that are warring upon you and great stre other knights 
they have ordained that he which shall do bestat the assembly shall undertake the garrison of this caste in such sort as that he shall hold it for his own alone againstall other 
the widow lady beginneth to weep  sir , saith she to messire gawain , now may you understnd that the caste is not mine own , sith that these knights say it is theirs as you hear 
certes , lady , saith he , herein do they great dishonour and a sin 
xi 
when the table was removed the damsel fell at messire gawain s feet , weeping 
he raiseth her forthwith and saith to her , damsel , herein do you ill 
for god s sake , sir , take pity on my lady mother and me 
certes , damsel , great pity have i of you 
sir , now shall it be seen in this stait whether you be good knight , for good is the knighthood that doeth well for god s sake 
the widow lady and her daughter go into the chamber , and messire gawain s bed was made in the midstof the hall 
he went and lay down as did also the five knights 
all the night was messire gawain in much thought 
the morrow , when he was risen , he went to hear mass in a chapel that was within and ate thereafter three sops in wine and then armed him , and at the same time asked the five knights that were there in the hall whether they would go see the assembly 
yea , sir , say they , and you be going thither 
in faith , thither verily will i go 
saith messire gawain 
the knights are armed forthwith , and their horses brought and messire gawain s , and he goeth to take leave of the widow lady and her daughter 
great joy make they of this that they have heard say that he will go with their knights to the assembly 
xii 
messire gawain and the five knights mounted and issued forth of the caste and rode a great gallop before a forest  messire gawain looketh before him about the foreclose of the forest and seeth the fairestpurlieus that he had seen ever , and so broad they be that he may not see nor know the fourth part thereof 
they are garnished of tall forest on one hand and on the other , and there are high rocks in the midstwith wild deer among 
sir , say the knights , lo , these be the valleys of camelot whereof my lady and her daughter have been bereft , and bereft also hath she been of the richestcastes that be in wales to the number of seven 
a wrong is it and a sin 
saith messire gawain 
far have they ridden that they see the ensigns and the shields there where the assembly is to be held , and they see already mounted the more part of the knights all armed and running their horses down the meadowland 
they see the tents stetched on the one hand and on another 
messire gawain bideth , and the five knights under a tree , and see the knights assembling on one hand and on another 
one of the five knights that were with him gave him witting of the lord of the moors and the brother of the knight of the red shield that had to name chaos the red 
soon as the tournament was assembled , messire gawain and the knights come to the assembly , and messire gawain goeth to a welsh knight and beareth him to the ground , both him and his horse , all in a heap 
the five come after at a great gallop and each overthroweth his own , and greatly pride they themselves of messire gawain 
chaos the red seeth messire gawain but knoweth him not 
he goeth toward him a full career , and messire gawain receiveth him on the point of his spear and hurtleth againsthim so sore that he all tobrasthis collarbone and maketh the spear fly from his fist  and messire gawain searcheth the fellowships of one part and the other , and findeth not nor encountereth no knight before him in his way but he putteth him off his horse or woundeth him , either by himself or by one of the five knights , that make right great joy of that they see him do 
they show him the lord of the moors that was coming with a full great fellowship of folk 
he goeth thitherward a great gallop 
they mell together either upon other of their spears that they bent and all tobrastin flinders , and hurtle together so stutly both of their horses and their bodies that the lord of the moors loseth his strrups and hath the hinder saddlebow tofrushed , and falleth down to the ground over his horse croup in such sort that the peak of his helm dinteth a full palm s breadth into the turf 
messire gawain taketh the horse that was right rich and good , maugre all of his fellowship , and giveth it to one of the five knights that maketh it be led to camelot of a squire 
messire gawain searcheth the ranks on the one hand and on the other , and doeth such feats of arms as never no knight might do the same again 
the five knights also showed great hardiment , and did more of arms that day than ever had they done tofore , for not one of them but had overthrown at leasta single knight and won his horse 
the lord of the moors was mounted again on another rich horse and had great shame for that messire gawain had overthrown him 
he espieth messire gawain and goeth toward him a great gallop and thinketh to avenge his shame 
they come together either on other with a great shock , and messire gawain smiteth him with the truncheon of his spear that he had stll left , in the midstof his breast so that it was all tosplintered 
the lord of the moors likewise again tobrasthis spear upon him 
messire gawain drweth his sword and flingeth the truncheon to the ground 
the lord of the moors doth likewise and commandeth his folk not to mell betwixt them twain , for never yet had he found no knight that he had not conquered 
they deal them great buffets on the helms , either upon other , in such sort that the sparks fly thereout and their swords are blunted 
the buffets of messire gawain are heavier than the other s , for he dealeth them so mighty and horrible that the blood rayeth out from the lord of the moors by the mouth and the nose so that his habergeon is all bloody thereof and he may no more endure 
thereupon he yieldeth him prisoner to messire gawain , that is right glad thereof and his live knights likewise 
the lord of the moors goeth to his tent to alight , and messire gawain with him and alighteth 
messire gawain taketh the horse and saith to one of the knights , keep this for me 
all the knights are repaired to their tents , and with one accord say they all that the knight of the red shield with the eagle of gold thereon hath done better than we , and they ask the lord of the moors whether he accordeth with them , and he saith aye 
sir , saith he to messire gawain , you , then , are the warden of this caste of camelot 
gramercy , lord 
saith messire gawain 
he calleth the five knights and saith unto them  lords , my will is that you be there on my behalf and that you shall safeguard the same by consent of the knights that are here present 
sir , right gladly do we agree thereto 
sir , saith messire gawain to the lord of the moors , i give you moreover as my prisoner to the widow lady that harboured me lastnight 
sir , saith he , this have you no right to do 
assembly of tourney is not war 
hence have you no right to imprison my body in caste , for well am i able to pay my ransom here 
tell me , what is your name 
i am called gawain 
ha , messire gawain , many a time have i heard tell of you albeit never tofore have i seen you 
sith that the caste of camelot is in your keeping , i promise you loyally that before a year and a day neither the caste nor none of the lady s land need fear nought from me nor from any other so far forth as i may hinder him , and hereto do i pledge me in the presence of all these knights that are here 
so you would have of me gold or silver , thereof will i give you at your will 
sir , saith messire gawain , gramercy 
i consent freely to as much as you have said 
messire gawain taketh leave and turneth him again toward the caste of camelot , and sendeth by a squire the horse of the lord of the moors to the daughter of the widow lady , that made great joy thereof 
the five knights drve before them the horses they have taken booty 
whereof great also was the joy 
no need to wonder whether messire gawain were well harboured that night at the caste 
he recounted to the lady how the caste was in the keeping of these knights 
when it came to morningtide , messire gawain took leave and departed from the caste , but not before he had heard mass , for such was his custm 
the widow lady and her daughter commend him to god , and the caste remaineth in better keeping than he had found it 
branch iv 
incipit 
here beginneth another branch of the graal in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
the stry is silent here of the mother of the good knight , and saith that messire gawain goeth so as god and adventure lead him toward the land of the rich king fisherman 
he entereth into a great forest all armed , his shield at his neck and his spear in his hand 
he prayeth our lord that he counsel him of this holy errand he hath emprised so as that he may honourably achieve it 
he rode until that he came at evensong to a hold that was in the midstof the forest  and it was compassed about of a great water , and had about it great clumps of trees so as that scarce with much pains might he espy the hall , that was right large 
the river that compassed it about was water royal , for it lostnot its right name nor its body as far as the sea 
messire gawain bethought him that it was the hold of a worshipful man , and drweth him thitherward to lodge 
as he drw anigh the bridge of the hold , he looketh and seeth a dwarf sitting on a high bench 
he leapeth up  messire gawain , saith he , welcome may you be 
fair , sweet friend , saith messire gawain , god give you good adventure 
you know me , then 
saith he 
well do i know you , saith the dwarf , for i saw you at the tournament 
at a better moment could you not have come hither , for my lord is not here 
you will find my lady , the fairestand mostgentle and mostcourteous in the realm of logres , and as yet is she not of twenty years 
fair friend , saith messire gawain , what name hath the lord of the hold 
sir , he is called of little gomeret 
i will go tell my lady that messire gawain is come , the good knight , and bid her make great joy 
howbeit , messire gawain marvelleth much that the dwarf should make him such cheer , for many knaveries hath he found in many places within the bodies of many dwarfs 
the dwarf is come into the chamber where the lady was 
now , hast , lady 
saith he , make great joy , for messire gawain is come to harbour with you 
certes , saith she , of this am i right glad and right sorry 
glad , for that the good knight will lie here tonight , sorry , for that he is the knight that my lord mosthateth in the world 
wherefore he warneth me againsthim for love of him , for oftentimes hath he told me that never did messire gawain keep faith with dame nor damsel but he would have his will of them 
lady , saith the dwarf , it is not true albeit it is so said 
ii 
thereupon messire gawain entereth into the courtyard and alighteth , and the lady cometh to meet him and saith to him  may you be come to joy and good adventure 
lady , saith he , may you also have honour and good adventure 
the lady taketh him by the hand and leadeth him into the hall and maketh him be seated on a cushion of staw 
a squire leadeth his horse to stble 
the dwarf summoneth two other squires and doeth messire gawain be disarmed , and helpeth them right busily , and maketh fetch water to wash his hands and his face 
sir , saith the dwarf , your fist are stll all swollen of the buffets you gave and received at the tournament 
messire gawain answered him nought 
the dwarf entereth into the chamber and bringeth a scarlet robe furred of ermine and maketh it be done on messire gawain 
meat was made ready and the table set , and the lady sate to eat 
many a time looked he upon the lady by reason of her great beauty , and , had he been minded to trustto his heart and his eyes , he would have all tochanged his purpose 
so staitly was his heart bound up , and so quenched the desires thereof , that nought would he allow himself to think upon that might turn to wickedness , for the sake of the high pilgrimage he had emprised 
rather  gan he withdrw his eyes from looking at the lady , that was held to be of passing great beauty 
after meat messire gawain s bed was made , and he apparelled himself to lie down 
the lady bade him god give him good adventure , and he made answer the like 
when the lady was in her chamber , the dwarf said to messire gawain  sir , i will lie before you , so as to keep you company until you be asleep 
gramercy , saith he , and god allow me at some time to reward you of the service 
the dwarf laid himself down on a mattress before messire gawain , and when he saw that he slept , he ariseth as quickly as he may , and cometh to a boat that was on the river that ran behind the hall , and entereth thereinto and roweth upsteam of the river 
he cometh to a fishery , where was a right fair hall on a little eyot enclosed by a marshy arm of the river 
the jealous knight was come thither for disport , and lay in the midstof the hall upon a couch 
the dwarf cometh forth of his boat thereinto , and lighteth a great candle in his fistand cometh before the couch 
what ho , there 
saith the dwarf , are you sleeping 
the other waketh up sore strtled , and asketh what is the matter and wherefore is he come 
in god s name , saith he , you sleep not so much at your ease as doth messire gawain 
how know you that 
saith he 
well know i , saith the dwarf , for i left him but now in your hall , and methinketh he and your lady are abed together arm to arm 
how 
saith he , i forbade her she should ever harbour messire gawain 
in faith , said the dwarf , she hath made him greater cheer than ever saw i her make to none other 
hast you and come , for great fear have i lesthe carry her away 
by my head 
saith the knight 
i will go not , howsoever it be 
she shall pay for it , even though she go 
of wrong will it be 
saith the dwarf , as methinketh 
iii 
messire gawain lay in the hall that was ware of nought of this 
he seeth that day hath broken fair and clear , and ariseth up 
the lady cometh to the door of the hall and seeth not the dwarf , whereby well she understndeth his treachery 
she saith to messire gawain , sir , for god s sake have pity upon me , for the dwarf hath betrayed me 
you withdrw yourself forth of our forestand help not to rescue me from the smart that my lord will make me suffer , great sin will you have thereof 
for well know you 
that of right ought i not to be held guilty toward my lord nor toward any other , for aught that you have done toward me or i toward you 
you say true , saith messire gawain 
thereupon is he armed , and taketh leave of the lady and issueth forth of the fair hold and setteth him in an ambush in the forestnigh thereby 
staightway behold the jealous knight where he cometh , he and his dwarf 
he entereth into the hall 
the lady cometh to meet him 
sir , saith she , welcome may you be 
you , saith he , shame and evil adventure may you have , as the mostdisloyal dame on live , for that this night have you harboured in my hostl and in my bed him that mosthave i warned you against sir , saith she , in your hostl did i harbour him , but never hath your bed been shamed by me , nor never shall be 
you lie 
saith he , like a false woman 
he armeth himself all incontinent and maketh his horse be armed , then maketh the lady go down and despoil her to her shirt , that crieth him mercy right sweetly and weepeth 
he mounteth his horse and taketh his shield and his spear , and maketh the lady be taken of the dwarf by her tresses and maketh her be led before him into the forest  and he bideth above a pool where was a spring , and maketh her enter into the water that flowed forth full cold , and gathereth saplings in the forestfor rods and beginneth to smite and beat her across upon her back and her breastin such sort that the steam from the spring was all bloody therewithal 
she began to cry out right loud , until at lastmessire gawain heareth her and drweth forth of the ambush wherein he was , and cometh thitherward a great gallop 
by my faith , saith the dwarf , look you here where messire gawain cometh 
by my faith , saith the knight , now know i well that nought is there here but treachery , and that the matter is well proven 
by this time , messire gawain is come , and saith  avoid , sir knight 
wherefore slay you the bestlady and mostloyal that ever have i seen 
never tofore have i found lady that hath done me so much honour , and this ought you to be well pleased to know , for neither in her bearing , nor in her speech , nor in herself found i nought save all goodness only 
wherefore i pray you of franchise and of love that you forbear your wrath and that you set her forth of the water 
so will i swear on all the sacred hallows in this chapel that never did i beseech her of evil nor wantonness nor never had i no desire thereof 
the knight was full of great wrath when he saw that messire gawain had not gone his way thence , and an anguish of jealousy burneth him heart and body and overburdeneth him of folly and outrage , and messire gawain that is stll before him moveth him to yet further transgression 
natheless , for the fear that he hath of him he speaketh to him  messire gawain , saith he , i will set her forth thence on one condition , that you joustat me and i at you , and , so you conquer me , quit shall she be of misdoing and of blame , but and if i shall conquer you , she shall be held guilty herein 
such shall be the judgment in this matter 
i ask no better , saith messire gawain 
iv 
thereupon , the knight biddeth the dwarf make set the lady forth of the pool of the spring and make her sit in a launde whereas they were to joust  the knight drweth him back the better to take his career , and messire gawain cometh as fastas his horse may carry him toward marin the jealous 
when marin seeth him coming , he avoideth his buffet and lowereth his spear and cometh to his wife that was right sore distaught , and wept as she that suffered blameless , and smote her through , out the body and slew her , and then turneth him again so fastas his horse might carry him toward his hold 
messire gawak seeth the damsel dead and the dwarf that fleeth full speed after his lord 
he overtaketh him and trampleth him under his horses feet so that he burstth his belly in the midst  then goeth he toward the hold , for he thinketh to enter therein 
he found the bridge shut up and the gate barred 
marin crieth out upon him 
this shame and misadventure hath befallen me along of you , but you shall pay for it yet and i may live 
messire gawain hath no mind to argue with him , but rather drweth him back and cometh again to where the lady lay dead , and setteth her on the neck of his horse all bleeding , and then beareth her to a chapel that was without the entrance of the hold 
he alighted and laid her within the chapel as fairly as mosthe might , as he that was sore grieved and wrathful thereof 
after that , he shut the door of the chapel again as he that was afeared of the body for the wild beast , and bethought him that one should come thither to set her in her shroud and bury her after that he was departed 
v 
thereupon messire gawain departeth , sore anangered , for it seemed him that never had no thing tofore befallen him that weighed so heavy on his heart 
he rideth thoughtful and downcastthrough the forest and seeth a knight coming along the way he came 
in stange fashion came he 
he bestode his horse backwards in right outlandish guise , face to tail , and he had his horse s reins right across his breastand the base of his shield bore he topmostand the chief bottommost and his spear upside down and his habergeon and chausses of iron trussed about his neck 
he seeth messire gawain coming beside the forest that hath great wonderment of him when he seeth him 
natheless , when they drw nigh , he turneth him not to look at messire gawain , but crieth to him aloud  gentle knight , you that come there , for god s sake do me no hurt , for i am the knight coward 
by god , saith messire gawain , you look not like a man to whom any ought to do hurt 
but for the heaviness of his heart and the sore wrath that he had , he would have laughed at his bearing with a right good will 
sir knight , saith messire gawain , nought have you to be afeard of from me 
with that he drweth anigh and looketh on him in the face and the knight coward on him 
sir , saith he , welcome may you be 
you likewise 
saith messire gawain 
whose man are you , sir knight 
the damsel s man of the car 
thereof i love you the better , saith messire gawain 
god be praised thereof , saith the knight coward , for now shall i have no fear of you 
nay , truly , saith messire gawain , thereof be well assured 
the knight coward seeth messire gawains shield and knoweth it 
ha , sir , saith he , now know i well who you are 
now will i alight and ride the right way and set my arms to rights 
for you are messire gawain , nor hath none the right to claim this shield but only you 
the knight alighteth and setteth his armour to rights , and prayeth messire gawain abide until he be armed 
he abideth right willingly , and helpeth him withal 
thereupon behold you a knight where he cometh a great gallop athwart the forestlike a tempest and he had a shield party black and white 
abide , messire gawain 
saith he , for on behalf of marin the jealous do i defy you , that hath slain his wife on your account 
sir knight , saith messire gawain , thereof am i right heavy of heart , for death had she not deserved 
that availeth nor , saith the party knight , for i hold you to answer for the death 
i conquer you , the wrong is yours 
and you conquer me , my lord holdeth his blame and shame for known and will hold you to forfeit and you allow me to escape hence on live 
to this will i not agree , saith messire gawain , for god well knoweth that no blame have i herein 
ha , messire gawain , saith the knight coward , fight him not as having affiance in me , for of me will you have neither succour nor help 
heretofore , saith messire gawain , have i achieved adventures without you , and this also , and god help me , will i yet achieve 
they come together a full career and break their lances on their shields , and messire gawain hurtleth againstthe horse and passeth beyond and overthroweth him and his horse together 
drweth he his sword and runneth upon him 
the knight crieth out  hold , messire gawain 
are you minded to slay me 
i yield me conquered , for no mind have i to die for another s folly , and so i cry you mercy hereof 
messire gawain thinketh that he will do him no further harm , for that of right behoveth him do his lord s bidding 
messire gawain holdeth his hands , and he doth him homage on behalf of his lord for his hold and all of his land and becometh his man 
vi 
thereupon the knight departeth and messire gawain remaineth there 
sir , saith the knight coward to messire gawain , i have no mind to be so hardy as are you 
for , so god help me , had he defied me in suchwise as he defied you , should have fled away forthwith , or elsewise i should hay fallen at his feet and cried him of mercy 
you wish for nought but peace , saith messire gawain 
by s 
james , saith the coward , therein are you quite right , for of war cometh nought but evil 
nor never have i had no hurt nor wound saw some branch of a tree or the like gave it me , and i see your face all seamed and scarred in many places 
god help me , of such hardiesse make i but small account , and every day i pray god that he defend me 
so to god i commend you , for i am going after my damsel of the car 
not thus shall you go , saith messire gawain , save you tell me firstwherefore your damsel of the car beareth her arm slung to her neck in suchwise 
sir , this may i will tell you 
with this hand serve she of the mostholygraal the knight that was in the hostl of king fisherman that would not ask whereof the graal served 
for that she held therein the precious vessel whereinto the glorious blood fell drp by drp from the point of the lance , so that none other thing is she minded to hold therein until such time as she shall come back to the holy place where it is 
sir , saith the knight coward , now , so please you , may i well go hence , and see , here is my spear that i give you , for nought is there that i have to do therewithal 
messire gawain taketh it , for his own was broken short , and departeth from the knight and commendeth him to god 
he goeth his way a great pace , and messire gawain also goeth amidstthe forest and full weary is he and forspent with travail 
he rode until the sun was due to set 
he meeteth a knight that was coming athwart the forestand came toward messire gawain a great gallop like as he were smitten through the body , and crieth over all the forest what is your name , sir knight 
my name is gawain 
ha , messire gawain , saith the other , in your service am i wounded thus 
how in my service 
saith messire gawain 
sir , i was minded to bury the damsel that you bare into the chapel , and marin the jealous ran upon me and wounded me in many places in such manner as you see 
i had already dug a grave with my sword to bury the body when he seized it from me and abandoned it to the wild beast 
now go i hence yonder to the chapel of a hermit that is in this forestto confess me , for well know i that i have not long to live for that the wound lieth me so nigh my heart 
i shall die the more easily now that i have found you and shown you the hurt that hath been done me for your sake 
certes , saith messire gawain , this grieveth me 
vii 
therewithal the knights depart asunder , and messire gawain rode on until he found in the foresta caste right fair and rich , and met an ancient knight that was issued forth of the caste for disport , and held a bird on his fist  he saluteth messire gawain and he him again , and he asked him what caste is this that he seeth show so fair 
he telleth him it is the caste of the proud maiden that never deigned ask a knight his name 
we , that are her men , durstnot do it on her behalf 
right well will you be lodged in the caste , for right courteous is she otherwise and the fairestthat ever any may know 
nor never hath she had any lord , nor deigned to love no knight save she heard tell that he was the bestknight in the world 
i will go to her with you of courtesy 
gramercy , sir , saith messire gawain 
they enter into the caste both twain together , and alight at the mountingstge before the hall 
the knight taketh messire gawain by the hand and leadeth him up , and maketh disarm him , and bringeth him a surcoat of scarlet purfled of vair and maketh him do it on 
leadeth he the lady of the caste to messire gawain , and he riseth up to meet her 
lady , saith he welcome may you be 
you , sir , be welcome 
saith she , will you see my chapel 
damsel , saith he , at your pleasure 
she leadeth him and taketh messire gawain by the hand , and he looketh at the chapel and it well seemeth him that never before had he come into none so fair nor so rich , and he seeth four tombs within , the fairestthat he had seen ever 
on the right hand side of the chapel were three narrow openings in the wall that were wrought all about with gold and precious stnes , and beyond the three openings he seeth great circlets of lighted candles that were before three coffers of hallows that were there , and the smell thereof was sweeter than balm 
sir knight , saith the damsel , see you these tombs 
yea , damsel , saith messire gawain 
these three are made for the three bestknights in the world and the fourth for me 
the one hath for name messire gawain and the second lancelot of the lake 
each of them do i love for love s sake , by my faith 
the third hath for name perceval 
him love i better than the other two 
within these three openings are the hallows set for love of them 
behold what i would do to them and their three heads were therein 
so i might not do it to the three together , yet would i do it to two , or even to one only 
she setteth her hand toward the openings and drweth forth a pin that was fastned into the wall , and a cutting blade of stel drppeth down , of stel sharper than any razor , and closeth up the three openings 
even thus will i cut off their heads when they shall set them into those three openings thinking to adore the hallows that are beyond 
afterward will i make take the bodies and set them in the three coffins , and do them be honoured and enshrouded right richly , for joy of them in their life may i never have 
when the end of my life shall be come as god will , even so will i make set me in the fourth coffin , and so shall i have company of the three good knights 
messire gawain heard the word 
whereof he marvelled right sore , and would right fain that the night were overpassed 
they issue forth of the chapel 
the damsel maketh messire gawain be greatly honoured that night , and there was great company of knights within that served him and helped guard the caste 
they show messire gawain much worship , but they knew not that it was he , nor did none ask him , for such was the custm of the caste 
well she knew that he oftentimes passed to and fro amidstthe forest and four of the knights that watched the forestand the passersby had she commanded that and if any of these three knights should pass they should bring him to her without gainsay , and she would increase the land of each for so doing 
viii 
messire gawain was in the caste that night until the morrow , and went to hear mass in the chapel or ever he removed thence 
afterward , when he had heard mass and was armed , he took leave of the damsel and issued forth of the caste as he that had no desire to abide there longer 
he entereth into the forestand rideth a long league welsh and findeth two knights sitting by a narrow path in the forest  and when they see him coming they leap up on their horses all armed and come againstmessire gawain , shields on sides and spears in fist 
bide , sir knight 
say they , and tell us your name without leasing 
lords , saith he , right willingly 
never hath my name been withholden when it hath been asked for 
i am called gawain , king arthurs nephew 
nay , then , sir , welcome may you be 
one other demand have we to make of you 
will you come with us to the lady in the world who mostdesireth you , and will make much joy of you at caste orguelleux where she is 
lord , saith messire gawain , no leisure have i at this time , for i have emprised my way elsewhither 
sir , say they , needs mustyou come thither without fail , for in such wise hath she commanded us that we shall take you thither by force an you come not of your own goodwill 
i have told you plainly that thither will i not go , saith messire gawain 
with that , they leap forward and take him by the bridle , thinking to lead him away by force 
messire gawain hath shame thereof , and drweth his sword and smiteth one of them in such wrath that he cutteth off his arm 
the other letteth the bridle go and turneth him full speed 
his fellow with him that was maimed 
away go they toward caste orguelleux and the proud maiden of the caste and show her the mischief that hath befallen them 
who hath mishandled you thus 
saith she 
certes , lady , messire gawain 
where found you him 
lady , say they , in the forest where he came toward us a full gallop , and was minded to pass by the narrows of the way , when we bade him abide and come to you 
come he would not 
we offered him force , and he smote my fellows arm off 
she biddeth a horn be sounded incontinent , and the knights of the caste arm , and she commandeth them follow messire gawain , and saith that she will increase the land and the charge of him that shall bring him to her 
they were a good fifteen knights armed 
justas they were about to issue out of the caste , behold you forthwith two keepers of the forestwhere they come , both twain of them smitten through the body 
the damsel and the knights ask who hath done this to them , and they say it was messire gawain that did it , for that they would have brought him to the caste 
is he far away 
saith the damsel 
yea , say they , four great leagues welsh 
wherefore the greater folly would it be to follow him , saith one of the sixteen knights , for nought should we increase thereby save only our own shame and hurt , and my lady hath losthim through her own default , for well know we that he it was that lay within , for that he beareth a shield sinople with a golden eagle 
yea , saith the wounded knight , without fail 
is this then he 
saith the damsel 
i know him well now that i have losthim by my pride and by my outrage 
nor never more will knight lie in my hostl sith that he will be estanged for that i ask not his name 
it is too late 
herein have i failed of this one for ever and ever save god bring him back to me , and through this one shall i lose the other two 
ix 
herewithal cometh to a sty the pursuit of messire gawain , that goeth his way and prayeth god that he send him true counsel of that he hath emprised , and that he allow him to come into some place where he may hear true witting of the hostl of king fisherman 
while he was thus thinking , he heareth a brachet questng , and he cometh toward him a great pace 
when he is come anigh messire gawain he setteth his nose to the ground and findeth a track of blood through a grassy way in the forest and when messire gawain was minded to leave the way where the track of blood was , the brachet came over againsthim and questd 
messire gawain is minded not to abandon the track , wherefore he followeth the brachet a great pace until he cometh to a marish in the midstof the forest and seeth there in the marish a house , ancient and decayed 
he passeth with the brachet over the bridge , that was right feeble , and there was a great water under it , and cometh to the hall , that was wastd and old 
the brachet leaveth of his questng 
messire gawain seeth in the midstof house a knight that was sticken right through the breastunto the heart and there lay dead 
a damsel was issuing forth of the chamber and bare the windingsheer wherein to enshroud him 
damsel , saith messire gawain , good adventure may you have 
the damsel that was weeping right tenderly , saith to him  sir , i will answer you not 
she cometh toward the dead knight , thinking that his wounds should have begun to bleed afresh , but they did not 
sir , saith she to messire gawain , welcome may you be 
damsel , saith he 
god grant you greater joy than you have 
the damsel saith to the brachet  it was not this one i sent you back to fetch , but him that slew this knight 
know you then , damsel , who hath slain him 
saith messire gawain 
yea , saith she , well 
lancelot of the lake slew him in this forest on whom god grant me vengeance , and on all them of king arthur s court , for sore mischief and great hurt have they wrought us 
please god , right well shall this knight yet be avenged , for a right fair son hath he whose sistr am i , and so hath he many good friends withal 
damsel , to god i commend you 
saith messire gawain 
with that , he issueth forth of the wast manor and betaketh him back to the way he had abandoned , and prayeth god grant he may find lancelot of the lake 
branch v 
incipit 
here beginneth again another branch of the graal in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
messire gawain goeth his way and evening drweth on 
on his right hand was there a narrow pathway that seemed him to be haunted of folk 
thitherward goeth he , for that he seeth the sun waxeth low , and findeth in the thick of the foresta great chapel , and without was a right fair manor 
before the chapel was an orchard enclosed of a wooden fence that was scarce so high as a tall man 
a hermit that seemed him a right worshipful man was leaning againstthe fence , and looked into the orchard and made great cheer from time to time 
he seeth messire gawain , and cometh to meet him , and messire gawain alighteth 
sir , saith the hermit , welcome may you be 
god grant you the joy of paradise , saith messire gawain 
the hermit maketh his horse be stbled of a squire , and then taketh him by the hand and maketh him sit beside him to look on the orchard 
sir , saith the hermit , now may you see that whereof i was making cheer 
messire gawain looketh therewithin and seeth two damsels and a squire and a child that were guarding a lion 
sir , saith the hermit , here see my joy , which is this child 
saw you ever so fair a child his age 
never , saith messire gawain 
they go into the orchard to sit , for the evening was fair and calm 
he maketh disarm him , and thereupon the damsel bringeth him a surcoat of right rich silk furred of ermine 
messire gawain looketh at the child that rode upon the lion right fainly 
sir , saith the hermit , none durstguard him or be mastr over him save this child only , and yet the lad is not more than six years of age 
sir , he is of right noble lineage , albeit he is the son of the mostcruel man and mostfelon that is 
marin the jealous is his father , that slew his wife on account of messire gawain 
never sithence that his mother was dead would not the lad be with his father , for well knoweth he that he slew her of wrong 
i am his uncle , so i make him be tended here of these damsels and these two squires , but no one thing is there that he so much desireth to see as messire gawain 
for after his father s death ought he of right to be messire gawain s man 
sir , if any tidings you know of him , tell us them 
by my faith , sir , saith he , tidings true can i give you 
lo , there is his shield and his spear , and himself shall you have this night for guest fair sir , are you he 
saith the hermit 
men call me , saith messire gawain , and the lady saw i slain in the forest whereof was i sore anangered 
ii 
fair nephew , saith the hermit , see here your desire 
come to him and make him cheer 
the lad alighteth of the lion and smiteth him with a whip and leadeth him to the den and maketh the door so that he may not issue forth , and cometh to messire gawain , and messire gawain receiveth him between his arms 
sir , saith the child , welcome may you be 
god give you growth of honour 
saith messire gawain 
he kisseth him and maketh cheer with him right sweetly 
sir , saith the hermit , he will be of right your man , wherefore ought you to counsel him and help him , for through you came his mother by her death , and right sore need will he have of your succour 
the child kneeleth before him and holdeth up his joined hands 
look , sir , saith the hermit , is he not right pitiful 
he offereth you his homage 
messire gawain setteth his hands within his own  certes , saith messire gawain , both your honour and your homage receive i gladly , and my succour and my counsel shall you have so often as you shall have need thereof 
fain would i know your name 
sir , i am called meliot of logres 
sir , saith the hermit , he saith true , for his mother was daughter of a rich earl of the kingdom of logres 
iii 
messire gawain was well harboured the night and lay in a right fair house and right rich 
in the morning , when messire gawain had heard mass , the hermit asked him , whitherward go you 
he said , toward the land of king fisherman , and god allow me 
messire gawain , saith the hermit , now god grant you speed your business better than did the other knight that was there before you , through whom are all the lands fallen into sorrow , and the good king fisherman languisheth thereof 
sir , saith messire gawain , god grant me herein to do his pleasure 
thereupon he taketh his leave and goeth his way , and the hermit commendeth him to god 
messire gawain rideth on his journeys until he hath left far behind the forestof the hermitage , and findeth the fairestland in the world and the fairestmeadowlands that ever had he seen , and it lastd a good couple of great leagues welsh 
he seeth a high forestbefore him , and meeteth a squire that came from that quarter , and seeth that he is sore downcastand right simple 
fair friend , saith messire gawain , whence come you 
sir , saith he , i come from yonder forestdown below 
whose man are you 
saith messire gawain 
i belong to the worshipful man that owneth the forest you seem not over joyful , saith messire gawain 
sir , i have right to be otherwise , saith the squire , for he that loseth his good lord ought not to be joyful 
who is your lord 
the bestin the world 
is he dead 
saith messire gawain 
nay , of a truth , for that would be right sore grief to the world , but in joy hath he not been this long time past and what name hath he 
they call him parlui there where he is 
where then , is he , may i know 
in no wise , sir , of me 
so much may i well tell you that he is in this forest but i ought not to learn you of the place more at large , nor ought i to do any one thing that may be againstmy mastr s will 
messire gawain seeth that the squire is of passing comeliness and seeth him forthwith bow his head toward the ground and the tears fall from his eyes 
thereupon he asketh what aileth him 
sir , saith he , never may i have joy until such time as i be entered into a hermitage to save my soul 
for the greatestsin that any man may do have i wrought 
for i have slain my mother that was a queen , for this only that she told me i should not be king after my father s death , for that she would make me monk or clerk , and that my other brother , who is youngerborn than i , should have the kingdom 
when my father knew that i had slain my mother , he withdrw himself into this forest and made a hermitage and renounced his kingdom 
i have no will to hold the land for the great disloyalty that i have wrought , and therefore am i resolved that it is meeter i should set my body in banishment than my father 
what is your name 
saith messire gawain 
sir , my name is joseus , and i am of the lineage of joseph of abarimacie 
king pelles is my father , that is in this forest and king fisherman mine uncle , and the king of caste mortal , and the widow lady of camelot my aunt , and the good knight parlui fet is of this lineage as near akin as i 
iv 
with that , the squire departeth and taketh leave of messire gawain , and he commendeth him to god and hath great pity of him , and entereth into the forestand goeth great pace , and findeth the steam of a spring that ran with a great rushing , and nigh thereunto was a way that was much haunted 
he abandoneth his highway , and goeth all along the steam from the spring that lastth a long league plenary , until that he espieth a right fair house and right fair chapel well enclosed within a hedge of wood 
he looketh from without the entrance under a little tree and seeth there sitting one of the seemliestmen that he had ever seen of his age 
he was clad as a hermit , his head white and no hair on his face , and he held his hand to his chin , and made a squire hold a destier right fair and stong and tail , and a shield with a sun thereon 
he was looking at a habergeon and chausses of iron that he had made bring before him 
when he seeth messire gawain he drsseth him over againsthim and saith  fair sir , saith he , ride gently and make no noise , for no need have we of worse than that we have 
messire gawain drweth rein , and the worshipful man saith to him  sir , for god s sake take it not of discourtesy 
for right fainly would i have besought you to harbour had i not good cause to excuse me , but a knight lieth within yonder sick , that is held for the bestknight in the world 
wherefore fain would i he should have no knight come within this close , for and if he should rise , as sick as he is , none might prevent him nor hold him back , but presently he should arm him and mount on his horse and joustat you or any other 
so he were here , well might we be the worse thereof 
therefore do i keep him so close and quiet within yonder , for that i would not have him see you nor none other , for and he were so soon to die , sore loss would it be to the world 
sir , saith messire gawain , what name hath he 
sir , saith he , he hath made him of himself , and therefore do i call him parluifer , of dearness and love 
sir , saith messire gawain , may it not be in any wise that i may see him 
sir , saith the hermit , i have told you plainly that nowise may it not be 
no stange man shall not see him within yonder until such time as he be whole and of good cheer 
sir , saith messire gawain , will you in nowise do nought for me whatsoever i may say 
certes , sir , no one thing is there in the world that i would tell him , save he spake firstto me 
hereof is messire gawain right sorrowful that he may not speak to the knight 
sir , saith he to the hermit , of what age is the knight , and of what lineage 
of the lineage of joseph of abarimacie the good soldier 
v 
thereupon behold you a damsel that cometh to the door of the chapel and calleth very low to the hermit , and the hermit riseth up and taketh leave of messire gawain , and shutteth the door of the chapel 
the squire leadeth away the destier and beareth the arms within door and shutteth the postrn door of the house 
messire abideth without and knoweth not of a truth whether it be the son of the widow lady , for many good men there be of one lineage 
he departeth all abashed and entereth again into the forest  the histry telleth not all the journeys that he made 
rather , i tell you in brief words that he wandered so far by lands and kingdoms that he found a right fair land and a rich , and a caste seated in the midstthereof 
thitherward goeth he and drweth nigh the caste and seeth it compassed about of high walls , and he seeth the entrance of the caste far without 
he looketh and seeth a lion chained that lay in the midstof the entrance to the gate , and the chain was fixed in the wall 
on either side of the gate he seeth two serjeants of beaten copper that were fixed to the wall , and by engine shot forth quarrels from their crossbows with great force and great wrath 
messire gawain durstnot come anigh the gate for that he seeth the lion and these folk 
he looketh above on the top of the wall and seeth a sort of folk that seemed him to be of holy life , and saw there priest clad in albs and knights bald and ancient that were clad in ancient seeming garments 
in each crenel of the wall was a cross and a chapel 
above the wall , hard by an issue from a great hall that was in the caste , was another chapel , and above the chapel was a tall cross , and on either side of this cross another that was somewhat lower , and on the top of each cross was a golden eagle 
the priest and the knights were upon the walls and knelt toward this chapel , and looked up to heaven and made great joy , and well it seemed him that they beheld god in heaven with his mother 
messire gawain looketh at them from afar , for he durstnot come anigh the caste for these that shoot their arrows so stongly that none armour might defend him 
way seeth he none to right nor left save he go back again 
he knoweth not what to do 
he looketh before him and seeth a priestissue forth of the gateway 
fair sir , saith messire gawain , welcome may you be 
good adventure to you also , saith the good man , what is your pleasure 
sir , saith messire gawain , so please you , i would fain ask you to tell me what caste is this 
it is , saith he , the entrance to the land of the rich king fisherman , and within yonder are they beginning the service of the mostholy graal 
allow me then , saith messire gawain , that i may pass on further , for toward the land of king fisherman have i emprised my way 
sir , saith the priest i tell you of a truth that you may not enter the caste nor come nigher unto the holy graal , save you bring the sword wherewith s 
john was beheaded 
what 
saith messire gawain , shall i be evilly entreated and i bring it not 
much may you well believe me herein , saith the priest and i tell you moreover that he who hath it is the fellestmisbelieving king that lives 
so you bring the sword , this entrance will be free to you , and great joy will be made of you in all places wherein king fisherman hath power 
musti needs go back again , saith messire gawain , whereof i have right to be sore sorrowful 
ought you not to be , saith the priest for , so you bring the sword and conquer it for us , then will it be well known that you are worthy to behold the holy graal 
take heed you remember him who would not ask whereof it served 
thereupon messire gawain departeth so sorrowful and full of thought that he remembereth not to ask in what land he may find the sword nor the name of the king that hath it 
he will know tidings thereof when god pleaseth 
vi 
the histry telleth us and witnesseth that he rode so far that he came to the side of a little hill , and the day was right fair and clear 
he looketh in front of him before a chapel and seeth a tall burgess sitting on a great destier that was right rich and fair 
the burgess espieth messire gawain and cometh over againsthim , and saluteth him right courteously and messire gawain him 
sir , saith messire gawain , god give you joy 
sir , saith the goodman , right sorrowful am i of this that you have a horse so lean and spare of flesh 
better would it become so worshipful man as you seem to be that he were better horsed 
sir , saith messire gawain , i may not now amend it , whereof am i sorry 
another shall i have when it shall please god 
fair sir , saith the burgess , whither are you bound to go 
i go seek the sword wherewith the head of s 
john baptistwas cut off 
ha , sir , saith the burgess , you are running too sore a peril 
a king hath it that believeth not in god , and is sore fell and cruel 
he is named gurgalain , and many knights have passed hereby that went thither for the sword , but never thence have they returned 
and you are willing to pledge me your word that so god grant you to conquer the sword , you will return hither and show it me on your return , i will give you this destier , which is right rich , for your own 
will you 
saith messire gawain , then are you right courteous , for you know me not 
certes , sir , saith he , so worshipful man seem you to be , that you will hold well to this that you have covenanted with me 
to this do i pledge you my word , saith messire gawain , that , so god allow me to conquer it , i will show it to you on my return 
vii 
thereupon the burgess alighteth and mounteth upon messire gawain s horse , and messire gawain upon his , and taketh leave of the burgess and goeth his way and entereth into a right great forestbeyond the city , and rideth until sundown and findeth neither caste nor city 
he findeth a meadow in the midstof the forest right broad , and it ran on beyond , like as there were the steam of a spring in the midst  he looketh toward the foot of the meadow close by the forest and seeth a right large tent , whereof the cords were of silk and the pegs of ivory fixed in the ground , and the tops of the poles of gold and upon each was a golden eagle 
the tent was white round about , and the hanging above was of the richestsilk , the same as red samite 
thitherward goeth messire gawain and alighteth before the door of the tent , and smiteth off the bridle of his horse , and letteth him feed on the grass , and leaneth his spear and his shield without the tent , and looketh narrowly withinand seeth a right rich couch of silk and gold , and below was a cloth unfolded as it were a featherbed , and above a coverlid of ermine and vair without any gold , and at the head of the couch two pillows so rich that fairer none ever saw , and such sweet smell gave they forth that it seemed the tent was sprinkled of balm 
round about the couch were rich silken cloths spread on the ground 
at the head of the couch on the one side and the other were two seats of ivory , and upon them were two cushions stffed with staw , right rich , and at the foot of the couch , above the bed , two candlestcks of gold wherein were two tall waxen tapers 
a table was set in the midstof the tent , that was all of ivory banded of gold , with rich precious stnes , and upon the table was the napkin spread and the basin of silver and the knife with an ivory handle and the rich set of golden vessels 
messire gawain seeth the rich couch and setteth him down thereon all armed in the midst and marvelleth him wherefore the tent is so richly apparelled and yet more that therein he seeth not a soul 
howbeit , he was minded to disarm him 
viii 
thereupon , behold you , saluteth a dwarf that entereth the tent and saluteth messire gawain 
he kneeleth before him and  would fain disarm him 
messire gawain remembereth him of the dwarf through whom the lady was slain 
fair sweet friend , withdrw yourself further from me , for as at this time i have no mind to disarm 
sir , saith the dwarf , without misgiving may you do so , for until tomorrow have you no occasion to be on your guard , and never were you more richly lodged than tonight you shall be , nor more honourably 
with that messire gawain began to disarm him , and the dwarf helpeth him 
when he was disarmed , he setteth his arms nigh the couch and his spear and sword and shield lying within the tent , and the dwarf taketh a basin of silver and a white napkin , and maketh messire gawain wash his hands and his face 
afterward , he unfastneth a right fair coffer , and drweth forth a robe of cloth of gold furred of ermine and maketh messire gawain be clad therewithal 
sir , saith the dwarf , be not troubled as touching your destier , for you will have him again when you rise in the morning 
i will lead him close hereby to be better at ease , and then will i return to you 
messire gawain giveth him leave 
thereupon , behold you , two squires that bear in the wine and set the meats upon the table and make messire gawain sit to eat , and they have great torches lighted on a tall cresset of gold and depart swiftly 
whilstmessire gawain was eating , behold you , thereupon , two damsels that come into the tent and salute him right courteously 
he maketh answer , the fairesthe may 
sir , say the damsels , god grant you force and power tomorrow to destoy the evil custm of this tent 
is there then any evil custm herein , damsel 
saith he 
yea , sir , a right foul custm , whereof much it grieveth me , but well meseemeth that you are the knight to amend it by the help of god 
ix 
therewith he riseth from the table , and one of the squires was apparelled to take away the cloths 
the two damsels take him by the hand and lead him without the tent , and they set them down in the midstof the meadow 
sir , saith the elder damsel , what is your name 
damsel , saith he , gawain is my name 
thereof do we love you the better , for well we know that the evil custm of the tent shall be done away on condition that you choose tonight the one of us two that mostshall please you 
damsel , gramercy , saith he 
thereupon he riseth up , for he was weary , and drweth him toward the couch , and the damsels help him and wait upon his going to bed 
when he was lien down , they seated themselves before him and lighted the taper and leant over the couch and prospered him much service 
messire gawain answered them naught save gramercy , for he was minded to sleep and take his rest by god , saith the one to the other , and this were messire gawain , king arthur s nephew , he would speak to us after another sort , and more of disport should we find in him than in this one 
this is a counterfeit gawain , and the honour we have done him hath been ill bestwed 
who careth 
tomorrow shall he pay his reckoning 
x 
thereupon , lo you , the dwarf where he cometh 
fair friend , say they , keep good watch over this knight that he flee not away , for he goeth acadging from , hostl to hostl and maketh him be called messire gawain , but messire gawain meseemeth is he not 
for , and it were he , and we had been minded to watch with him two nights , he would have wished it to be three or four 
damsel , saith the dwarf , he may not flee away save he go afoot , for his horse is in my keeping 
messire gawain heareth well enough that which the damsels say , but he answereth them never a word 
thereupon they depart , and say  god give him an ill night , for an evil knight and a vanquished and recreant , and command the dwarf that he move not on any occasion 
messire gawain slept right little the night , and so soon as he saw the day , arose and found his arms ready and his horse that had been led all ready saddled before the tent 
he armed himself as swiftly as he might , and the dwarf helpeth him and saith to him  sir , you have not done service to our damsels as they would fain you should , wherefore they make sore complaint of you 
that grieveth me , saith messire gawain , if that i have deserved it 
it is great pity , saith the dwarf , when knight so comely as be you is so churlish as they say 
they may say their pleasure , saith he , for it is their right 
i know not to whom to render thanks for the good lodging that i have had save to god , and if i shall see the lord of the tent or the lady i shall con them much thanks thereof 
xi 
thereupon , lo you , where two knights come in front of the tent on their horses , all armed , and see messire gawain that was mounted and had his shield on his neck and his spear in his fist as he that thinketh to go without doing aught further 
the knights come before him  sir , say they , pay for your lodging 
lastnight did we put ourselves to misease on your account and left you the tent and all that is therein at your pleasure , and now you are fain to go in this fashion 
what pleaseth it you that i should do 
saith messire gawain 
it is meet i should requite you of my victual and the honour of the tent 
thereupon , lo you , where the two damsels come that were of right great beauty 
sir knight , say they , now shall we see whether you be king arthur s nephew 
by my faith , saith the dwarf , methinketh this is not he that shall do away the evil custm whereby we lose the coming hither of knights 
albeit if he may do it , i will forego mine ill will toward him 
messire gawain thus heard himself mocked by day as well as by night and had great shame thereof 
he seeth that he may not depart without a fight 
one of the knights drw to backward and was alighted 
the other was upon his horse all armed , his shield on his neck and grasping his spear in his fist  and he cometh toward messire gawain full career and messire gawain toward him , and smiteth him so wrathfully that he pierceth his shield and pinneth his shield to his arm and his arm to his rib and thrustth his spear into his body , and hurtleth againsthim so sore that he beareth him to the ground , him and his horse together at the firstblow 
by my head 
look at messire gawain the counterfeit 
better doth he today than he did lastnight 
he drweth back his spear , and pulleth forth his sword and runneth upon him , when the knight crieth him mercy and saith that he holdeth himself vanquished 
messire gawain bethinketh him what he shall do and whether the damsels are looking at him 
sir knight , saith the elder , need you not fear the other knight until such time as this one be slain , nor will the evil custm be done away so long as this one is on live 
for he is the lord of the other and because of the shameful custm hath no knight come hither this right long space 
hearken now , saith the knight , the great disloyalty of her 
nought in the world is there she loved so well in seeming as did she me , and now hath she adjudged me my death 
again i tell you plainly , saith she , that never will it be done away unless he slay you 
thereupon messire gawain lifteth the skirt of his habergeon and thrustth his sword into his body 
thereupon , lo you , the other knight , right angry and sorrowful and full of wrath for his fellow that he seeth dead , and cometh in great rage to messire gawain and messire gawain to him , and so stutly they mell together that they pierce the shields and pierce the habergeons and break the flesh of the ribs with the points of their spears , and the bodies of the knights and their horses hurtle together so stffly that saddlebows are tofrushed and strrups loosened and girths tobrastand fewtres splintered and spears snapped short , and the knights drp to the ground with such a shock that the blood rayeth forth at mouth and nose 
in the fall that the knight made , messire gawain brake his collarbone in the hurtle 
thereupon the dwarf crieth out  damsel , your counterfeit gawain doth it well 
our gawain shall he be , say they , so none take him from us 
messire gawain drweth from over the knight and cometh toward his horse , and right fain would he have let the knight live had it not been for the damsels 
for the knight crieth him mercy and messire gawain had right great pity of him 
howbeit the damsels cry to him 
you slay him not , the evil custm will not be overthrown 
sir , saith the younger damsel , and you would slay him , smite him in the sole of his foot with your sword , otherwise will he not die yet 
damsel , saith the knight , your love of me is turned to shame 
never more ought knight to set affiance nor love on damsel 
god keep the other that they be not such as you 
messire gawain marvelleth at this that the damsel saith to him , and drweth him back , and hath great pity of the knight , and cometh to the other side whither the horses were gone , and taketh the saddle of the knight that was dead and setteth it on his own horse and drweth him away 
the wounded knight was remounted , for the dwarf had helped him , and fleeth toward the foresta great gallop 
the damsels cry out , messire gawain , your pity will be our death this day 
for the knight without pity is gone for succour , and if he escape , we shall be dead and you also 
xii 
thereupon messire gawain leapeth on his horse and taketh a spear that was leaning againstthe tent and followeth the knight in such sort that he smiteth him to the ground 
afterward he saith to him  no further may you go 
that grieveth me , saith the knight , for before night should i have been avenged of you and of the damsels 
messire gawain drweth his sword and thrustth it into the sole of his foot a full palm s breadth , and the knight stetcheth himself forth and dieth 
messire gawain returneth back , and the damsels make great joy of him and tell him that never otherwise could the evil custm have been done away 
for , and he had gone his way , all would have been to begin over again , for he is of such kind seeing that he was of the kindrd of achilles , and that all his ancestrs might never otherwise die 
messire gawain alighteth , and the damsels would have searched the wound in his side , and he telleth them that he taketh no heed thereof 
sir , say they , again do we proffer you our service , for well we know that you are a good knight 
take for your ladylove which of us you will 
gramercy , damsel , saith messire gawain , your love do i refuse not and to god do i commend you 
how 
say the damsels , will you go your way thus 
certes , meeter were it today for you to sojourn in this tent and be at ease 
it may not be , saith he , for leisure have i none to abide here 
let him go 
saith the younger , for the falsestknight is he of the world 
by my head , saith the elder , it grieveth me that he goeth , for sty would have pleased me well 
therewithal messire gawain departeth and is remounted on his horse 
he entereth into the forest branch vi 
incipit 
another branch that josephus telleth us recounteth and witnesseth of the holy graal , and here beginneth for us in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
messire gawain rode until he came to a forest and seeth a land right fair and rich in a great enclosure of wall , and round the land and countryside within , the wall stetched right far away 
thitherward he cometh and seeth but one entrance thereinto , and he seeth the fairestland that ever he beheld and the bestgarnished and the fairestorchards 
the country was not more than four leagues welsh in length , and in the midstthereof was a tower on a high rock 
on the top was a crane that kept watch over it and cried when any stange man came into the country 
messire gawain rode amidstthe land and the crane cried out so loud that the king of wales heard it , that was lord of the land 
thereupon , behold you , two knights that come after messire gawain and say to him  hold , sir knight , and come speak with the king of this country , for no stange knight passeth through his land but he seeth him 
lords , saith messire gawain , i knew not of the custm 
willingly will i go 
they led him thither to the hall where the king was , and messire gawain alighteth and setteth his shield and his spear leaning againsta mounting stge and goeth up into the hall 
the king maketh great joy of him and asketh him whither he would go 
sir , saith messire gawain , into a country where i was never 
well i know , saith the king , where it is , for that you are passing through my land 
you are going to the country of king gurgalain to conquer the sword wherewith s 
john was beheaded 
ii 
sir , saith messire gawain , you say true 
god grant me that i may have it 
that may not be so hastly , saith the king , for you shall not go forth of my land before a year 
ha , sir , saith messire gawain , for god s sake , mercy 
none other mercy is here , saith the king 
staightway he maketh messire gawain be disarmed and afterward maketh bring a robe wherewith to apparel him , and showeth him much honour 
ill is he at ease , wherefore he saith to him  sir , wherefore are you fain to hold me here within so long 
for this , that i know well you will have the sword and will not return by me 
sir , saith messire gawain , i pledge you my word that , so god give me to conquer it , i will return by you 
i will allow you to depart from me at your will 
for nought is there that i so much desire to see 
he lay the night therewithin , and on the morrow departed thence and issued forth of the land right glad and joyful 
he goeth toward the land of king gurgalain 
he entereth into a noisome forestat the lower part and findeth at the right hour of noon a fountain that was enclosed of marble , and it was overshadowed of the forestlike as it were with leaves down below , and it had rich pillars of marble all round about with fillets of gold and set with precious stnes 
againstthe mastrpillar hung a vessel of gold by a silver chain , and in the midstof the fountain was an image so deftly wrought as if it had been alive 
when messire appeared at the fountain , the image set itself in the water and was hidden therewith 
messire gawain goeth down , and would fain have taken hold on the vessel of gold when a voice crieth out to him  you are not the good knight unto whom is served thereof and who thereby is made whole 
messire gawain drweth him back and seeth a clerk come to the fountain that was young of age and clad inú white garments , and he had a stle on his arm and held a little square vessel of gold , and cometh to the little vessel that was hanging on the marble pillar and looketh therein , and then rinseth out the other little golden vessel that he held , and then setteth the one that he held in the place of the other 
therewithal , behold , three damsels that come of right great beauty , and they had white garments and their heads were covered with white cloths , and they carried , one , bread in a little golden vessel , and the other wine in a little ivory vessel , and the third flesh in one of silver 
they come to the vessel of gold that hung againstthe pillar and set therein that which they have brought , and afterward they make the sign of the cross over the pillar and come back again 
on their going back , it seemed to messire gawain that only one was there 
messire gawain much marvelled him of this miracle 
he goeth after the clerk that carried the other vessel of gold , and saith unto him  fair sir , speak to me 
what is your pleasure 
saith the clerk 
whither carry you this golden vessel and that which is therein 
to the hermits , saith he , that are in this forest and to the good knight that lieth sick in the house of his uncle king hermit 
is it far from hence 
saith messire gawain 
yea , sir , saith the clerk , to yourself 
i shall be there sooner than will you 
by god , saith messire gawain , i would fain i were there now , so that i might see him and speak to him 
that believe i well , saith the clerk , but now is the place not here 
messire gawain taketh leave and goeth his way and rideth until he findeth a hermitage and seeth the hermit therewithout 
he was old and bald and of good life 
sir , saith he to messire gawain , whither go you 
to the land of king gurgalain , sir 
is this the way 
yea , saith the hermit , but many knights have passed hereby that hither have never returned 
is it far 
saith he 
he and his land are hard by , but far away is the caste wherein is the sword 
messire gawain lay the night therewithin 
on the morrow when he had heard mass , he departed and rode until he cometh to the land of king gurgalain , and heareth the folk of the land making dole right sore 
he meeteth a knight that cometh a great pace to a caste 
iv 
sir , saith messire gawain , wherefore make the folk of this caste such dole , and they of all this land and all this country 
for i hear them weep and beat their palms together on every side 
sir , saith he , i will tell you 
king gurgalain had one only son of whom he hath been bereft by a giant that hath done him many mischiefs and wastd much of his land 
now hath the king let everywhere be cried that to him that shall bring back his son and slay the giant he will give the fairestsword of the world , the which sword he hath , and of all his treasure so much as he may be fain to take 
as at this time , he findeth no knight so hardy that he durstgo 
much more blameth he his own law than the law of the christans , and he saith that if any christan should come into his land , he would receive him 
right joyous is messire gawain of these tidings , and departeth from the caste and rideth on until he cometh to the caste of king gurgalain 
the tidings come to the king that there is a christan come into his caste 
the king maketh great joy thereof , and maketh him come before him and asketh him of his name and of what land he is 
sir , saith he , my name is gawain and i am of the land of king arthur 
you are , saith he , of the land of the good knight 
of mine own land may i find none that durstgive counsel in a matter i have on hand 
if you be of such valour that you be willing to undertake to counsel me herein , right well will i reward you 
a giant hath carried off my son whom i loved greatly , and so you be willing to set your body in jeopardy for my son , i will give you the richestsword that was ever forged , whereby the head of s 
john was cut off 
every day at right noon is it bloody , for that at that hour the good man had his head cut off 
the king made fetch him the sword , and in the firstplace showeth him the scabbard that was loaded of precious stnes and the mountings were of silk with buttons of gold , and the hilt in likewise , and the pommel of a mostholy sacred stne that enax , a high emperor of rome , made be set thereon 
the king drweth it forth of the scabbard , and the sword came forth thereof all bloody , for it was the hour of noon 
he made hold it before messire gawain until the hour was past and thereafter the sword becometh as clear as an emerald and as green 
messire looketh at it and coveteth it much more than ever he did before , and he seeth that it is as long as another sword , albeit , when it is sheathed in the scabbard , neither scabbard nor sword seemeth of two spans length 
v 
sir knight , saith the king , this sword will i give you , and another thing will i do whereof you shall have joy 
sir , saith messire gawain , and i will do your need , if god please and his sweet mother 
thereupon he teacheth him the way whereby the giant went , and the place where he had his repair , and messire gawain goeth his way thitherward and commendeth himself to god 
the country folk pray for him according to their belief that he may back repair with life and health , for that he goeth in great peril 
he hath ridden until that he cometh to a great high mountain that lay round about a land that the giant had all laid wast , and the enclosure of the mountain went round about for a good three leagues welsh , and therewithin was the giant , so great and cruel and horrible that he feared no man in the world , and for a long time had he not been sought out by any knight , for none durstwon in that quarter 
the pass of the mountain whereby he went to his hold was so stait that no horse might get through 
wherefore behoveth messire gawain leave his horse and his shield and spear and to pass beyond the mountain by sheer force , for the way was like a cut between sharp rocks 
he is come to level ground and looketh before him and seeth a hold that the giant had on the top of a rock , and espieth the giant and the lad where they were sitting on the level ground under a tree 
messire gawain was armed and had his sword girt on , and goeth his way thitherward 
the giant seeth him coming and leapeth up and taketh in hand a great axe that was at his side , and cometh toward messire gawain all girded for the fight and thinketh to smite him a twohanded stoke right amidstthe head 
messire gawain swerveth aside and bestrreth him with his sword and dealeth him a blow such that he cut off his arm , axe and all 
the giant returneth backward when he feeleth himself wounded , and taketh the king s son by the neck with his other hand and grippeth him so staitly that he stangleth and slayeth him 
he cometh back to messire gawain and falleth upon him and grippeth him sore stait by the flanks , and lifteth him three foot high off the ground and thinketh to carry him to his hold that was within the rock 
as he goeth thither he falleth , messire gawain and all , and he lieth undermost  howbeit , he thinketh to rise , but cannot , for messire gawain sendeth him his sword right through his heart and beyond 
afterward , he cut off the head and cometh there where the king s child lay dead , whereof is he right sorrowful 
he beareth him on his neck , and taketh the giant s head in his hand and returneth there where he had left his horse and shield and spear , and mounteth and cometh back and bringeth the king s son before the king and the head of the giant hanging 
vi 
the king and all they of the caste come to meet him with right great joy , but when they see the young man dead , their great joy is turned into right great dole thereby 
messire gawain alighteth before the caste and presenteth to the king his son and the head of the giant 
certes , said he , might i have presented him to you on live , much more joyful should i have been thereof 
this believe i well , saith the king , howbeit , of so much as you have done am i well pleased , and your guerdon shall you have 
he looketh at his son and lamenteth him right sweetly , and all they of the caste after him 
thereafter he maketh light a great show of torches in the midstof the city , and causeth a great fire to be made , and his son be set thereon in a brazen vessel all full of water , and maketh him be cooked and sodden over this fire , and maketh the giant s head be hanged at the gate 
vii 
when his son was well cooked , he maketh him be cut up as small as he may , and biddeth send for all the high men of his land and giveth thereof to each so long as there was any left 
after that he maketh bring the sword and giveth it to messire gawain , and messire gawain thanketh him much thereof 
more yet will i do for you , saith the king 
he biddeth send for all the men of his land to come to his hall and caste 
sir , saith he , i am fain to baptize me 
god be praised thereof , saith messire gawain 
the king biddeth send for a hermit of the forest and maketh himself be baptized , and he had the name of archis in right baptism 
of all them that were not willing to believe in god , he commanded messire gawain that he should cut off their heads 
viii 
in such wise was this king baptized that was the lord of albanie , by the miracle of god and the knighthood of messire gawain , that departeth from the caste with right great joy and rideth until he has come into the land of the king of wales and bethought him he would go fulfil his pledge 
he alighted before the hall , and the king made right great cheer when he saw him come 
messire gawain hath told him  i come to redeem my pledge 
behold , here is the sword 
the king taketh it in his hand and looketh thereon right fainly , and afterward maketh great joy thereof and setteth it in his treasury and saith  now have i done my desire 
sir , saith messire gawain , then have you betrayed me 
by my head , saith the king , that have i not , for i am of the lineage of him that beheaded s 
john , wherefore have i better right to it than you 
sir , say the knights to the king , right loyal and courteous knight is messire gawain , wherefore yield him that which he hath conquered , for sore blame will you have of eviltreating him 
i will yield it , saith the king on such condition that the firstdamsel that maketh requestof him , what thing soever she may require and whatsoever it be shall not be denied of him 
messire gawain agreeth thereto , and of this agreement thereafter did he suffer much shame and anguish and was blamed of many knights 
the king yielded him the sword 
he lay the night therewithin , and on the morrow so soon as he might , he departed and rode until he came without the city where the burgess gave him the horse in exchange for his own 
he remembered him of his covenant , and abideth a long space and leaneth him on the hilt of his sword until the burgess cometh 
therewithal made they great joy the one of the other , and messire showeth him the sword , and the burgess taketh it and smiteth his horse with his spurs and goeth a great gallop toward the city 
messire gawain goeth after a great pace and crieth out that he doth great treachery 
come not after me into the city , saith the burgess , for the folk have a commune 
howbeit , he followeth after into the city for that he might not overtake him before , and therein he meeteth a great procession of priest and clerks that bore crosses and censers 
messire gawain alighteth on account of the procession , and seeth the burgess that hath gone into the church and the procession after 
lords , saith messire gawain , make yield me the sword whereof this burgess that hath entered your church hath plundered me 
sir , say the priest , well know we that it is the sword wherewith s 
john was beheaded , wherefore the burgess hath brought it to us to set with our hallows in yonder , and saith that it was given him 
ha , lords 
saith messire gawain , not so 
i have but shown it to him to fulfil my pledge 
he hath carried it off by treachery 
afterward he telleth them as it had befallen him , and the priest make the burgess give it up , and with great joy messire gawain departeth and remounteth his horse and issueth forth of the city 
he hath scarce gone far before he meeteth a knight that came all armed , as fastas his horse could carry him , spear in rest  sir , saith he to messire gawain , i have come to help you 
we were told that you had been evilentreated in the city , and i am of the caste that succoureth all stange knights that pass hereby whensoever they have need thereof 
sir , saith messire gawain , blessed be the caste 
i plain me not of the trespass for that right hath been done me 
how is the caste named 
sir , they call it the caste of the ball 
will you return back thither with me , since you are delivered , and lodge there the night with messire , that is a right worshipful man , and of good conditions 
therewith they go together to the caste , that was right fair and wellseeming 
they enter in , and when they were within , the lord , that sate on a mountingstge of marble , had two right fair daughters , and he made them play before him with a ball of gold , and looked at them right fainly 
he seeth messire gawain alight and cometh to meet him and maketh him great cheer 
afterward , he biddeth his two daughters lead him into the hall 
ix 
when he was disarmed , the one brought him a right rich robe , and after meat the two maidens sit beside him and make him right great cheer 
thereupon behold you , a dwarf that issueth forth of a chamber , and he holdeth a scourge 
he cometh to the damsels and smiteth them over their faces and their heads 
rise up , saith he , ye fools , illtaught 
ye make cheer unto him whom you ought to hate 
for this is messire gawain , king arthur s nephew , by whom was your uncle slain 
thereupon they rise , all ashamed , and go into the chamber , and messire gawain remaineth there sore abashed 
their father comforteth him and saith  sir , be not troubled for aught that he saith , for the dwarf is our mastr  he chastseth and teacheth my daughters , and he is wroth for that you have slain his brother , whom you slew the day that marin slew his wife on your account , whereof we are right sorrowful in this caste 
also am i , saith messire gawain , but no blame of her death have i nor she , as god knoweth of very truth 
x 
messire gawain lay the night at the caste , and departed on the morrow , and rode on his journeys until he cometh to the caste at the entrance to the land of the rich king fisherman , where he seeth that the lion is not at the entrance nor were the serjeants of copper shooting 
he seeth in great procession the priest and them of the caste coming to meet him , and he alighteth , and a squire was apparelled ready , that took his armour and his horse , and he showeth the sword to them that were come to meet him 
it was the hour of noon 
he drweth the sword , and seeth it all bloody , and they bow down and worship it , and sing `te deum laudamus  
with such joy was messire gawain received at the caste , and he set the sword back in his scabbard , and kept it right anigh him , and made it not known in all the places where he lodged that it was such 
the priest and knights of the caste make right great joy , and pray him right instntly that so god should lead him to the caste of king fisherman , and the graal should appear before him , he would not be so forgetful as the other knights 
he made answer that he would do that which god should teach him 
xi 
messire gawain , saith the mastr of the priest , that was right ancient  great need have you to take rest for meseemeth you have had much travail 
sir , many things have i seen whereof i am sore abashed , nor know i what caste this may be 
sir , saith the priest this caste is the caste of inquest for nought you shall ask whereof it shall not tell you the meaning , by the witness of joseph , the good clerk and good hermit through whom we have it , and he knoweth it by annunciation of the holy ghost by my faith , saith messire gawain , i am much abashed of the three damsels that were at the court of king arthur 
two of them carried , the one the head of a king and the other of a queen , and they had in a car an hundrd and fifty heads of knights whereof some were sealed in gold , other in silver , and the restin lead 
true , saith the priest for as by the queen was the king betrayed and killed , and the knights whereof the heads were in the car , so saith she truth as joseph witnesseth to us , for he saith of remembrance that by envy was adam betrayed , and all the people that were after him and the people that are yet to come shall have dole thereof for ever more 
for that adam was the firstman is he called king , for he was our earthly father , and his wife queen 
the heads of the knights sealed in gold signify the new law , and the heads sealed in silver the old , and the heads sealed in lead the false law of the sarrazins 
of these three manner of folk is the world stblished 
sir , saith messire gawain , i marvel of the caste of the black hermit , there where the heads were all taken from her , and the damsel told me that the good knight should castthem all forth when he should come 
the other folk that are therewithin are longing for him 
well know you , saith the priest that on account of the apple that eve gave adam to eat , all went to hell alike , the good as well as the evil , and to casthis people forth from hell did god become man , and castthese souls forth from hell of his bounty and of his puissance 
to this doth joseph make us allusion by the caste or the black hermit which signifieth hell , and the good knight that shall thence castforth them that are within 
i tell you that the black hermit is lucifer , that is lord of hell in like manner as he fain would have been lord of paradise 
sir , saith the priest by this significance is he fain to drw the good hermits on behalt of the new law wherein the mostpart are not well learned , wherefore he would fain make allusion by ensample 
by god , saith messire gawain , i marvel much of the damsel that was all bald , and said that never should she have her hair again until such time as the good knight should have achieved the holy graal 
sir , saith the good man , each day full bald behoveth her to be , ever since bald she became when the good king fell into languishment on account of the knight whom he harboured that made not the demand 
the bald damsel signifieth joseu josephus , that was bald before the crucifixion of our lord , nor never had his hair again until such time as he had redeemed his people by his blood and by his death 
the car that she leadeth after her signifieth the wheel of fortune , for like as the car goeth on the wheels , doth she lay the burden of the world on the two damsels that follow her 
this you may see well , for the fairestfolloweth afoot and the other was on a sorry hackney , and they were poorly clad , whereas the third had costier attire 
the shield whereon was the red cross , that she left at the court of king arthur , signifieth the mostholy shield of the rood that never none durstlift save god alone 
messire gawain heareth these significances and much pleaseth him thereof , and thinketh him that none durstset his hand to nor lift the shield that hung in the king s hall , as he had heard tell in many places 
wherefore day by day were they waiting for the good knight that should come for the shield 
xii 
sir , saith messire gawain , by this that you tell me you do me to wit that whereof i was abashed , but i have been right sorrowful of a lady that a knight slew on my account albeit no blame had she therein , nor had i 
sir , saith the priest right great significance was there in her death , for josephus witnesseth us that the old law was destoyed by the stoke of a sword without recover , and to destoy the old law did our lord suffer himself to be smitten in the side of a spear 
by this stoke was the old law destoyed , and by his crucifixion 
the lady signifieth the old law 
would you ask more of me 
saith the priest sir , saith messire gawain , i met a knight in the forestthat rode behind before and carried his arms upside down 
he said that he was the knight coward , and his habergeon carried he on his neck , and so soon as he saw me he set his arms to rights and rode like any other knight 
the law was turned to the worse , saith the priest before our lord s crucifixion , and so soon as he was crucified , was again restred to right 
even yet have i not asked you of all , saith messire gawain , for a knight came and joustd with me party of black and white , and challenged me of the death of the lady on behalf of her husband , and told me and i should vanquish him that he and his men would be my men 
i did vanquish him and he did me homage 
it is right , saith the priest on account of the old law that was destoyed were all they that remained therein made subject , and shall be for ever more 
wish you to enquire of aught further 
saith the priest i marvel me right sore , saith messire gawain , of a child that rode a lion in a hermitage , and none durstcome nigh the lion save the child only , and he was not of more than six years , and the lion was right fell 
the child was the son of the lady that was slain on my account 
right well have you spoken , saith the priest in reminding me thereof 
the child signifieth the saviour of the world that was born under the old law and was circumcised , and the lion whereon he rode signifieth the world and the people that are therein , and beast and birds that none may govern save by virtue of him alone 
god 
saith messire gawain , how great joy have i at heart of that you tell me 
sir , i found a fountain in a forest the fairestthat was ever seen , and an image had it within that hid itself when it saw me , and a clerk brought a golden vessel and took another golden vessel that hung at the column that was there , and set his own in place thereof 
afterward , came three damsels and filled the vessel with that they had brought thither , and staightway meseemed that but one was there 
sir , saith the priest i will tell you no more thereof than you have heard , and therewithal ought you to hold yourself well apaid , for behoveth not discover the secrets of the saviour , and them also to whom they are committed behoveth keep them covertly 
xiii 
sir , saith messire gawain , i would fain ask you of a king 
when i had brought him his son back dead , he made him be cooked and thereafter made him be eaten of all the folk of his land 
sir , saith the priest already had he leant his heart upon jesus christ and would fain make sacrifice of his flesh and blood to our lord , and for this did he make all those of his land eat thereof , and would fain that their thoughts should be even such as his own 
therefore was all evil belief uprooted from his land , so that none remained therein 
blessed be the hour , saith messire gawain , that i came herewithin 
mine be it 
saith the priest messire gawain lay therewithin the night , and right well lodged was he 
the morrow , when he had heard mass , he departed and went forth of the caste when he had taken leave 
he findeth the fairestland of the world and the fairestmeadowgrounds that were ever seen , and the fairestrivers and forest garnished of wild deer and hermitages 
he rideth until he cometh one day as evening was about to drw on , to the house of a hermit , and the house was so low that his horse might not enter therein 
his chapel was scarce taller , and the good man had never issued therefrom of forty years past  the hermit putteth his head out of the window when he seeth messire gawain and saith , sir , welcome may you be , saith he 
sir , god give you joy , will you give me lodging tonight 
saith messire gawain 
sir , herewithin none harboureth save the lord god alone , for earthly man hath never entered herewithin but me this forty year , but see , here in front is the caste wherein the good knights are lodged 
what is the caste 
sir , the good king fisherman s , that is surrounded with great waters and plenteous in all things good , so the lord were in joy 
behoveth them harbour none there save good knights only 
god grant , saith messire gawain , that i may come therein 
xiv 
when he knoweth that he is nigh the caste , he alighteth and confesseth him to the hermit , and avoweth all his sins and repenteth him thereof right truly 
sir , saith the hermit , now forget not , so god be willing to allow you , to ask that which the other knight forgat , and be not afeard for ought you may see at the entrance of the caste , but ride on without misgiving and adore the holy chapel you will see appear in the caste , there where the flame of the holy spirit descendeth each day for the mostholy graal and the point of the lance that is served there 
sir , saith messire gawain , god teach me to do his will 
he taketh leave , and goeth his way and rideth until the valley appeareth wherein the caste is seated garnished of all things good , and he seeth appear the mostholy chapel 
he alighteth , and then setteth him on his knees and boweth him down and adoreth right sweetly 
thereafter he remounteth and rideth until he findeth a sepulchre right rich , and it had a cover over , and it lay very nigh the caste , and it seemed to be within a little burialground that was enclosed all round about , nor were any other tombs therein 
a voice crieth to him as he passeth the burialground  touch not the sepulchre , for you are not the good knight through whom shall it be known who lieth therein 
messire gawain passeth beyond when he had heard the voice and drweth nigh the entrance of the caste , and seeth that three bridges are there , right great and right horrible to pass 
three great waters run below , and him seemeth that the firstbridge is a bowshot in length and in breadth not more than a foot 
stait seemeth the bridge and the water deep and swift and wide 
he knoweth not what he may do , for it seemeth him that none may pass it , neither afoot nor on horse 
xv 
thereupon , lo you , a knight that issueth forth of the caste and cometh as far as the head of the bridge , that was called the bridge of the eel , and shouteth aloud  sir knight , pass quickly before it shall be already night , for they of the caste are awaiting us 
ha , saith messire gawain , fair sir , but teach me how i may pass hereby 
certes , sir knight , no passage know i to this entrance other than this , and if you desire to come to the caste , pass on without misgiving 
messire gawain hath shame for that he hath styed so long , and forthinketh him of this that the hermit told him , that of no mortal thing need he be troubled at the entrance of the caste , and therewithal that he is truly confessed of his sins , wherefore behoveth him be the less adrad of death 
he crosseth and blesseth himself and commendeth himself to god as he that thinketh to die , and so smiteth his horse with his spurs and findeth the bridge wide and large as soon as he goeth forward , for by this passing were proven mostof the knights that were fain to enter therein 
much marvelled he that he found the bridge so wide that had seemed him so narrow 
when he had passed beyond , the bridge , that was a drwbridge , lifted itself by engine behind him , for the water below ran too swiftly for other bridge to be made 
the knight drweth himself back beyond the great bridge and messire gawain cometh nigh to pass it , and this seemed him as long as the other 
he seeth the water below , that was not less swift nor less deep , and , so far as he could judge , the bridge was of ice , feeble and thin , and of a great height above the water , and he looked at it with much marvelling , yet natheless not for that would he any the more hold back from passing on toward the entrance 
he goeth forward and commendeth himself to god , and cometh in the midstthereof and seeth that the bridge was the fairestand richestand stongesthe had ever beheld , and the abutments thereof were all full of images 
when he was beyond the bridge , it lifted itself up behind him as the other had done , and he looketh before him and seeth not the knight , and is come to the third bridge and nought was he adrad for anything he might see 
it was not less rich than the other , and had columns of marble all round about , and upon each a knop so rich that it seemed to be of gold 
after that , he beholdeth the gate over againsthim , and seeth our lord there figured even as he was set upon the rood , and his mother of the one side and s 
john of the other , whereof the images were all of gold , with rich precious stnes that flashed like fire 
on the right hand he seeth an angel , passing fair , that pointed with his finger to the chapel where was the holy graal , and on his breasthad he a precious stne , and letters written above his head that told how the lord of the caste was the like pure and clean of all evilseeming as was this stne 
xvi 
thereafter at the entrance of the gate he seeth a lion right great and horrible , and he was upright upon his feet 
soon as he seeth messire gawain , he croucheth to the ground , and messire gawain passeth the entrance without gainsay and cometh to the caste , and alighteth afoot , and setteth his shield and his spear againstthe wall of the hall , and mounteth up a flight of marble stps and cometh into a hall right fair and rich , and here and there in divers places was it painted with golden images 
in the midstthereof he findeth a couch right fair and rich and high , and at the foot of this couch was a chessboard right fair and rich , with an orle of gold all full of precious stnes , and the pieces were of gold and silver and were not upon the board 
meanwhile , as messire gawain was looking at the beauty of the chessboard and the hall , behold you two knights that issue forth of a chamber and come to him 
sir , say the knights , welcome may you be 
god give you joy and good 
adventure , saith messire gawain 
they make him sit upon the couch and after that make him be disarmed 
they bring him , in two basins of gold , water to wash his face and hands 
after that , come two damsels that bring him a rich robe of silk and cloth of gold 
they make him do on the same 
say the two damsels to him , take in good part whatsoever may be done to you therewithin , for this is the hostl of good knights and loyal 
damsels , saith messire gawain , so will i do 
gramercy of your service 
he seeth well that albeit the night were dark , within was so great brightness of light without candles that it was marvel 
it seemed him the sun shone there 
wherefore marvelled he right sore whence so great light should come 
xvii 
when messire gawain was clad in the rich robe , right comely was he to behold , and well seemed he to be a knight of great valour 
sir , say the knights , may it please you come see the lord of this caste 
right gladly will i see him , saith he , for i would fain present him with a rich sword 
they lead him into the chamber where lay king fisherman , and it seemed as it were all stown and sprinkled of balm , and it was all stown with green herbs and reeds 
king fisherman lay on a bed hung on cords whereof the stvs were of ivory 
therein was a mattress of staw whereon he lay , and above a coverlid of sables whereof the cloth was right rich 
he had a cap of sables on his head covered with a red samite of silk , and a golden cross , and under his head was a pillow all smelling sweet of balm , and at the four corners of the pillow were four stnes that gave out a right great brightness of light 
over againsthim was a pillar of copper whereon sate an eagle that held a cross of gold wherein was a piece of the true cross whereon god was set , as long as was the cross itself 
the which the good man adored 
in four tall candle stcks of gold were four tall wax tapers set as often as was need 
messire gawain cometh before the king and saluteth him 
the king maketh him right great cheer , and biddeth him be welcome 
sir , saith messire gawain , i present you with the sword whereof john was beheaded 
gramercy 
saith the king  certes , i knew well that you would bring it , for neither you nor other might have come in hither without the sword , and if you had not been of great valour you would not have conquered it 
he taketh the sword and setteth it to his mouth and so kisseth it right sweetly and maketh right great joy thereof 
a damsel cometh to sit at the head of the bed , to whom he giveth the sword in keeping 
two others sit at his feet that look at him right sweetly 
what is your name 
saith the king 
sir , my name is gawain 
ha , messire gawain , saith he , this brightness of light that shineth there within cometh to us of god for love of you 
for every time that a knight cometh hither to harbour within this caste it appeareth as brightly as you see it now 
greater cheer would i make you than i do were i able to help myself , but i am fallen into languishment from the hour that the knight of whom you have heard tell harboured herewithin 
on account of one single word he delayed to speak , did this languishment come upon me 
wherefore i pray you for god s sake that you remember to speak it , for right glad should you be and you may restre me my health 
see here is the daughter of my sistr that hath been plundered of her land and disinherited in such wise that never can she have it again save through her brother only whom she goeth to seek 
we have been told that he is the bestknight of the world , but we can learn no true tidings of him 
sir , saith the damsel to her uncle the king , thank messire gawain of the honour he did to my ladymother when he came to her hostl 
he stblished our land again in peace , and conquered the keeping of the caste for a year , and set my ladymother s five knights there with us to keep it 
the year hath now passed , wherefore will the war be now renewed againstus and god succour us not , and i find not my brother whom we have lostso long 
damsel , saith messire gawain , i helped you so far as i might , and so would i again and i were there 
fainer am i to see your brother than all the knights of the world 
no true tidings may i hear of him , save so much , that i was at a hermitage where was a king hermit and he bade me make no noise for that the bestknight of the world lay sick therewithin , and he told me that name was parluifet 
i saw his horse being led by a squire before the chapel , and his arms and shield whereon was a sun figured 
sir , saith the damsel , my brother s name is not parluifet , but perlesvax in right baptism , and it is said of them that have seen him that never comelier knight was known 
certes , saith the king , never saw i comelier than he that came in hither nor better like to be good knight , and i know of a truth that such he is , for otherwise never might he have entered hereinto 
good reward of harbouring him had i not , for i may help neither myself nor other 
for god s sake , messire gawain , hold me in remembrance this night , for great affiance have i in your valour 
certes , sir , please god , nought will i do within yonder , whereof i may be blamed of right 
xviii 
thereupon messire gawain was led into the hall and findeth twelve ancient knights , all bald , albeit they seemed not to be so old as they were , for each was of a hundrd year of age or more and yet none of them seemed as though he were forty 
they have set messire gawain to eat at a right rich table of ivory and seat themselves all round about him 
sir , saith the mastr of the knights , remember you of that the good king hath prayed of you and told you this night as you have heard 
sir , saith messire gawain , god remember it 
with that bring they larded meats of venison and wildboar s flesh and other in great plenty , and on the table was rich array of vessels of silver and great cups of gold with their covers , and the rich candlestcks where the great candles were burning , albeit their brightness was hidden of the great light that appeared within 
xix 
thereon , lo you , two damsels that issue forth of a chapel , whereof the one holdeth in her hands the mostholy graal , and the other the lance whereof the point bleedeth thereinto 
the one goeth beside the other in the midstof the hall where the knights and messire gawain sat at meat , and so sweet a smell and so holy came to them therefrom that they forgat to eat 
messire gawain looketh at the graal , and it seemed him that a chalice was therein , albeit none there was as at this time , and he seeth the point of the lance whence the red blood ran thereinto , and it seemeth him he seeth two angels that bear two candlestcks of gold filled with candles 
the damsels pass before messire gawain , and go into another chapel 
messire gawain is thoughtful , and so great a joy cometh to him that nought remembereth he in his thinking save of god only 
the knights are all daunted and sorrowful in their hearts , and look at messire gawain 
thereupon behold you the damsels that issue forth of the chamber and come again before messire gawain , and him seemeth that he seeth three there where before he had seen but two , and seemeth him that in the midstof the graal he seeth the figure of a child 
the mastr of the knights beckoneth to messire gawain 
messire gawain looketh before him and seeth three drps of blood fall upon the table 
he was all abashed to look at them and spake no word 
therewith the damsels pass forth and the knights are all adrad and look one at the other 
howbeit messire gawain may not withdrw his eyes from the three drps of blood , and when he would fain kiss them they vanish away , whereof he is right sorrowful , for he may not set his hand nor aught that of him is to touch thereof 
therewithal behold you the two damsels that come again before the table and seemeth to messire gawain that there are three , and he looketh up and it seemeth him to be the graal all in flesh , grid he seeth above , as him thinketh , a king crowned , nailed upon a rood , and the spear was stll fastin his side 
messire gawain seeth it and hath great pity thereof , and of nought doth he remember him save of the pain that this king suffereth 
the mastr of the knights summoneth him again by word of mouth , and telleth him that if he delayeth longer , never more will he recover it 
messire gawain is silent , as he that heareth not the knight speak , and looketh upward 
the damsels go back into the chapel and carry back the mostholy graal and the lance , and the knights make the tablecloths be taken away and rise from meat and go into another hall and leave messire gawain all alone 
he looketh all around and seeth the doors all shut and made fast and looketh to the foot of the hall and seeth two candlestcks with many candles burning round about the chessboard , and he seeth that the pieces are set , whereof the one sort are silver and the other gold 
messire gawain sitteth at the game , and they of gold played againsthim and mated him twice 
at the third time , when he thought to revenge himself and saw that he had the worse , he swept the pieces off the board 
the damsel issued forth of a chamber and made a squire take the chessboard and the pieces and so carry them away 
messire gawain , that was wayworn of his wanderings to come thither where he now hath come , slept upon the couch until the morrow when it was day , and he heard a horn sound right shrill 
thereupon he armeth him and would fain go to take leave of king fisherman , but he findeth the doors bolted so that he may not get forth 
right fair service seeth he done in a chapel , and right sorrowful is he for that he may not hear the mass 
a damsel cometh into the hall and saith to him  sir , now may you hear the service and the joy that is made on account of the sword you presented to the good king , and right glad at heart ought you to have been if you had been within the chapel 
you lostentering therein on account of a right little word 
for the place of the chapel is so hallowed of the holy relics that are therein that man nor priestmay never enter therein from the saturday at noon until the monday after mass 
he heard the sweetestvoices and the fairestservices that were ever done in chapel 
messire gawain answereth her not a word so is he abashed 
howbeit the damsel saith to him  sir , god be guardian of your body , for methinketh that it was not of your own default that you would not speak the word whereof this caste would have been in joy 
with that the damsel departeth and messire gawain heareth the horn sound a second time and a voice warning him aloud  he that is from without , let him go hence 
for the bridges are lowered and the gate open , and the lion is in his den 
thereafter behoveth the bridge be lifted again on account of the king of the caste mortal , that warreth againstthis caste , and therefore of this thing shall he die 
thereupon messire gawain issueth forth of the hall and findeth his horse all made ready at the mountingstge , together with his arms 
he goeth forth and findeth the bridges broad and long , and goeth his way a great pace beside a great river that runneth in the midstof the valley 
he seeth in a great foresta mighty rain and tempest and so stong a thunderstrm ariseth in the forestthat it seemeth like all the trees should be uprooted 
great is the rain and the tempestthat it compelleth him set his shield over his horse s head lesthe be drwned of the abundance of rain 
in this misease rideth he down beside the river that runneth in the forestuntil he seeth in a launde across the river a knight and a damsel right gaily appointed riding at pleasure , and the knight carrieth a bird on his fist and the damsel hath a garland of flowers on her head 
two brachets follow the knight 
the sun shineth right fair on the meadow and the air is right clear and fresh 
messire gawain marvelleth much of this , that it raineth so heavily on his way , whereas , in the meadow where the knight and the damsel are riding , the sun shineth clear and the weather is bright and calm 
he seeth them ride joyously 
he can ask them naught for they are too far away 
messire gawain  looketh about and seeth on the other side the river a squire nearer to him than is the knight 
fair friend saith messire gawain , how is this that it raineth upon me on this side the river , but on the other raineth it not at all 
sir , saith the squire , this have you deserved , for such is the custm of the forest will this tempestthat is over me lastfor ever 
saith messire gawain 
at the firstbridge you come to will it be styed upon you , saith the squire 
therewith the squire departeth , and the tempestrageth incontinent until he is come to the bridge 
he rideth beyond and cometh to the meadow , and the strm is styed so that he setteth his shield to rights again upon his neck 
he seeth before him a caste where was a great company of folk that were making great cheer 
he rideth until he cometh to the caste and seeth right great throng of folk , knights and dames and damsels 
messire gawain alighteth , but findeth in the caste none that is willing to take his reins , so busied are they making merry 
messire gawain presenteth himself on the one side and the other , but all of them avoid him , and he seeth that he maketh but an ill sty therewithin for himself , wherefore he departeth from the caste and meeteth a knight at the gate 
sir , saith he , what caste is this 
see you not , saith the knight , that it is a caste of joy 
by my faith saith messire gawain , they of the caste be not overcourteous , for all this time hath none come to take my reins 
not for this lose they their courtesy , saith the knight , for this is no more than you have deserved 
they take you to be as slothful of deed as you are of word , and they saw that you were come through the forestperilous whereby pass all the discomfited , as well appeareth by your arms and your horse 
therewith the knight departeth , and messire gawain hath ridden a great space sorrowful and sore abashed , until he cometh to a land parched and poor and barren of all comfort , and therein findeth he a poor caste , whereinto he cometh and seeth it much wastd , but that within was there a hall that seemed haunted of folk 
messire gawain cometh thitherward and alighteth , and a knight cometh down the stps of the hall right poorly clad 
sir , saith the knight to messire gawain , welcome may you be 
after that , he taketh him by the hand and leadeth him upward to the hall , that was all wast 
therewithal issue two damsels from a chamber , right poorly clad , that were of passing great beauty , and make great cheer to messire gawain 
when he was fain to disarm , behold you thereupon a knight that entereth into the hall , and he was smitten with the broken end of a lance through his body 
he seeth messire gawain , whom he knoweth 
now hast 
saith he , and disarm you not 
right joyful am i that i have found you 
i come from this forestwherein have i left lancelot fighting with four knights , whereof one is dead , and they think that it is you , and they are of kindrd to the knight that you slew at the tent where you destoyed the evil custm 
i was fain to help lancelot , when one of the knights smote me as you may see 
messire gawain goeth down from the hall and mounteth all armed upon his horse 
sir , saith the knight of the hall , i would go help you to my power , but i may not issue forth of the caste until such time as it be replenished of the folk that are wont to come therein and until my land be again given up to me through the valour of the good knight 
messire gawain departeth from the caste as fastas horse may carry him , and entereth the forestand followeth the track of the blood along the way the knight had come , and rideth so far in the forestas that he heareth the noise of swords , and seeth in the midstof the launde lancelot and the three knights , and the fourth dead on the ground 
one of the knights had drwn him aback , for he might abide the combat no longer , for the knight that brought the tidings to messire gawain had sore wounded him 
the two knights beset lancelot full sore , and right weary was he of the buffets that he had given and received 
messire gawain cometh to one of the knights and smiteth him right through the body and maketh him and his horse roll over all of a heap 
when lancelot perceiveth messire gawain , much joy maketh he thereof 
in the meanwhile as the one held the other , the fourth knight fled full speed through the midstof the forest and he that the knight had wounded fell dead 
they take their horses , and messire gawain telleth lancelot he hath the mostpoverty sticken hostthat ever he hath seen , and the fairestdamsels known , but that right poorly are they clad 
shall we therefore take them of our booty 
i agree , saith lancelot , but sore grieveth me of the knight that hath thus escaped us 
take no heed , saith messire gawain , we shall do well enough herein 
thereupon they return back toward the poor knight s hostl and alight before the hall , and the poor knight cometh to meet them , and the two damsels , and they deliver to them the three horses of the three knights that were dead 
the knight hath great joy thereof , and telleth them that now is he a rich man and that betimes will his sistrs be better clad than are they now , as well as himself 
thereupon come they into the hall 
the knight maketh one of his own squires stble the horses and the two damsels help disarm lancelot and messire gawain 
lords , saith the knight , so god help me , nought have i to lend you wherewith to clothe you , for robe have i none save mine own jerkin 
lancelot hath great pity thereof and messire gawain , and the two damsels take off their kirtles that were made like surcoats of cloth that covered their poor shirts , and their jackets that , were all totorn and ragged and worn , and present them to the knights to clothe them 
they were fain not to refuse , lestthe damsels should think they held them not in honour , and did on the two kirtles right poor as they were 
the damsels had great joy thereof that so good knights should deign wear garments so poor 
lords , saith the poor knight , the knight that brought the tidings hither , and was sticken through of a lanceshaft , is dead and lieth on a bier in a chapel within the caste , and he confessed himself right well to a hermit and bade salute you both , and was right fain you should see him after that he were dead , and he prayed me instntly that i would ask you to be tomorrow at his burial , for better knights than be ye might not be thereat , so he told me 
certes , saith lancelot , a good knight was he , and much mischief is it of his death 
sore grieveth me that i know not his name nor of what country he was 
sir , saith messire gawain , he said that you should yet know it well 
the two good knights lay the night at the caste , and the poor knight lodged them as well as he might 
when it cometh to morning , they go to the chapel to hear mass and to be at the burial of the body 
after that they take leave of the poor knight and the two damsels and depart from the caste all armed 
messire gawain , saith lancelot , they know not at court what hath become of you , and they hold you for dead as they suppose 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , thitherward will i go , for i have had sore travail , and there will i abide until some will shall come to me to go seek adventure 
he recounteth to lancelot how the graal hath appeared to him at the court of king fisherman  and even as it was there before me , i forgat to ask how it served and of what 
ha , sir , saith lancelot , have you then been there 
yea , saith he , and thereof am i right sorry and glad  glad for the great holiness i have seen , sorry for that i asked not that whereof king fisherman prayed me right sweetly 
sir , saith lancelot , right sorely ill have you wrought , nor is there not whereof i have so great desire as i have to go to his caste 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , much shamed was i there , but this doth somewhat recomfort me , that the bestknight was there before me that gat blame thereof in like manner as i 
lancelot departeth from messire gawain , and they take leave either of other 
they issue forth of a forest and each taketh his own way without saying a word 
branch vii 
title i 
here the stry is silent of messire gawain and beginneth to speak of lancelot , that entereth into a forestand rideth with right great ado and meeteth a knight in the midstof the forestthat was coming full speed and was armed of all arms 
sir , saith lancelot , whence come you 
sir , saith lancelot , i come from the neighbourhood of king arthur s court 
ha , sir , can you tell me tidings of a knight that beareth a green shield such as i bear 
if so , he is my brother 
what name hath he 
saith lancelot 
sir , saith he , his name is gladoens , and he is a good knight and a hardy , and he hath a white horse right stong and swift 
be there other knights in your country that bear such arms as your shield and his besides you and he 
certes , sir , none 
wherefore do you ask 
saith lancelot 
for this , that a certain man hath reft him of one of his castes for that he was not there 
howbeit , i know well that he will have it again through his good knighthood 
is he so good knight 
saith lancelot 
certes , sir , yea 
he is the bestof the isles of the moors 
sir , of your mercy , lower your coif 
he quickly thereon lowereth his coif , and lancelot looketh at him in the face 
certes , sir knight , saith he , you very much resemble him 
ha , sir , saith the knight , know you then any tidings of him 
certes , sir , saith he , yea 
true tidings may i well say , for he rode at my side five leagues welsh , nor never saw i one man so like another as are you to him 
good right hath he to resemble me , saith the knight , for we are twins , but he was born firstand hath more sense and knighthood than i 
nor in all the isles of the moors is there damsel that hath so much worth and beauty as she of whom he is loved of right true love , and more she desireth to see him than aught else that liveth , for she hath not seen him of more than a year , wherefore hath she gone seek her prize , my brother , by all the forest of the world 
sir , saith the knight , let me go seek my brother , and tell me where i may find him 
certes , saith lancelot , i will tell you though it grieve me sore 
wherefore 
saith the knight , hath he done you any misdeed 
in no wise , saith lancelot , rather hath he done so much for me that i love you thereof and offer you my service 
sir , saith the knight , i am going my way , but for god s sake tell me where i shall find my brother 
sir , saith lancelot , i will tell you 
this morning did i bid his body farewell and help to bury him 
ha , sir , saith the knight , do you tell me true 
certes , saith lancelot , true it is that i tell you 
is he slain then , my brother 
saith the knight 
yea , and of succouring me , saith lancelot 
ha , sir , saith the knight , for god s sake tell me nought that is not right 
by god , sir , saith he , sore grieved am i to tell it you , for never loved i knight so much in so brief a time as i loved him 
he helped to save me from death , and therefore will i do for you according to that he did for me 
sir , saith the knight , if he be dead , a great grief is it to myself , for i have lostmy comfort and my life and my land without recovery 
sir , saith lancelot , he helped me to save my life , and yours will i help to save henceforth for ever and so be that i shall know of your jeopardy 
the knight heareth that his brother is dead and well believeth lancelot , and beginneth to make dole thereof the greatestthat was ever heard 
lancelot saith to him , sir knight , let be this dole , for none recovery is there 
my body do i offer you and my knighthood in any place you please , where i may save your honour 
sir , saith the knight , with good will receive i your help and your love , sith that you deign to offer me the same , and now have i sorer need of them than ever 
sir , saith the knight , sith that my brother is dead , i will return back and bear with my wrong , though well would he have amended it had he been on live 
by my head , saith lancelot , i will go with you , that so may i reward you of that he hath done for me 
he delivered his body to the death for me , and in like manner freely would i fain set mine own in jeopardy for love of you and of him 
ii 
sir , saith the knight , right good will do i owe you of this that you say to me , so your deeds be but the same herein 
yea , so help me god , saith lancelot , the same shall they be , if god lend me the power 
with that , they go on their way together , and the knight comforteth him much of that which lancelot hath said to him , but of the death of his brother was he right sorrowful 
they ride until they come to the land of the moors 
espy they a caste upon a rock , and below was a broad meadowland 
sir , saith the knight of the green shield to lancelot , this caste was my brother s and is now mine , and much it misliketh me that it hath fallen to me on this wise 
the knight that reft it of my brother is of so great hardihood that he feareth no knight on live , and you will presently see him issue forth of this caste so soon as he shall perceive you 
lancelot and the knight ride until they drw nigh the caste 
the knight looketh in the way before him , and seeth a squire coming on a hackney , that was carrying before him a wild boar dead 
the knight of the green shield asketh him whose man he is , and the squire maketh answer  i am man of the lord of the rock gladoens , that cometh there behind , and my lord cometh all armed , he and others , for the brother of gladoens hath defied him on behalf of his brother , but right little recketh my lord of his defiance 
iii 
lancelot heareth how he that is coming is the enemy of him to whom had he been alive , his love mostwas due 
the knight of the green shield pointed him out so soon as he saw him 
sir , saith he to lancelot , behold him by whom i am disherited , and yet worse would he do to me and he knew that my brother were dead 
lancelot , without saving more , so soon as he had espied the knight of the rock , smiteth his horse with his spurs and cometh toward him 
the lord of the rock , that was proud and hardy , seeth lancelot coming and smiteth with his spurs the horse whereon he sitteth 
they come with so swift an onset either upon other that they break their spears upon their shields , and hurtle together so sore that the knight of the rock gladoens falleth over the croup of his horse 
lancelot drweth his sword and cometh above him , and he crieth him mercy and asketh him wherefore he wisheth to slay him 
lancelot saith for the sake of gladoens from whom he hath reft his land and his caste 
what is that to you 
saith the knight 
behoveth his brother challenge me thereof 
as much it behoveth me as his brother , saith lancelot 
wherefore you 
for this , saith lancelot , that as much as he did for me will i do to you 
he cutteth off his head and giveth it incontinent to the knight of the green shield 
now tell me , saith lancelot , sith that he is dead , is he purged of that whereof you appeached him 
sir , saith the knight , i hold him rightly quit thereof , for , sith that he is dead , all claim on behalf of his kindrd is abated by his death 
i pledge you my faith loyally , saith lancelot , as i am a knight , that never shall you be in peril nor in jeopardy of aught wherein i may help you , so i be in place and free , but my help shall you have for evermore , for that your brother stked his life to help me 
iv 
lancelot and the knight lay the night at the rock gladoens , and the knight of the green shield had his land at his pleasure , and all were obedient to him 
the upright and loyal were right glad , albeit when they heard the tidings of gladoens  death they were right sorrowful thereof 
lancelot departed from the caste on the morrow , and the knight remained therein , sorrowful for his brother that he had lost and glad for the land that he had gotten again 
lancelot goeth back right amidstthe forestand rideth the day long , and meeteth a knight that was coming , groaning sore 
he was stoping over the fore saddlebow for the pain that he had 
he meeteth lancelot and saith to him  sir , for god s sake , turn back , for you will find there the mostcruel pass in the world there where i have been wounded through the body 
wherefore i beseech you not go thither 
what pass is it then 
saith lancelot 
sir , saith he , it is the pass of the caste of beards , and it hath the name of this , that every knight that passeth thereby musteither leave his beard there or challenge the same , and in such sort have i challenged my beard that meseemeth i shall die thereof 
by my head , saith lancelot , i hold not this of cowardize , sith that you were hardy to set your life in jeopardy to challenge your beard , but now would you argue me of cowardize when you would have me turn back 
rather would i be smitten through the body with honour , so and i had not my death thereof , than lose with shame a single hair of my beard 
sir , saith the knight , may god preserve you , for the caste is far more cruel than you think , and god guide the knight that may destoy the evil custm of the caste , for right shameful is the custm to stange knights that pass thereby 
v 
lancelot departeth from the knight and cometh toward the caste 
justas he had passed over a great bridge , he looketh about and seeth two knights come all armed to the entrance of the caste , and they made hold their horses before them , and their shields and spears are before them leaning againstthe wall 
lancelot looketh at the gateway of the caste and seeth the great door all covered with beards fastned thereon , and heads of knights in great plenty hung thereby 
as he was about to enter the gate , two knights issue therefrom over againsthim 
sir , saith the one , abide and pay your toll 
do knights , then , pay toll here 
saith lancelot 
yea 
say the knights , all they that have beards , and they that have none are quit 
sir , now pay us yours , for a right great beard it is , and thereof have we sore need 
for what 
saith lancelot 
i will tell you , saith the knight 
there be hermits in this forestthat make hairshirts thereof 
by my head , saith lancelot , never shall they have hairshirt of mine , so i may help it 
that shall they , say the knights , of yours as of the other , or dearly shall you pay therefor 
vi 
right wroth waxeth sir lancelot , and cometh to the knight , and smiteth him with his spear amidstthe breastwith such a thrustthat it passeth half an ell beyond , and overthroweth him and his horse together 
the other knight seeth his fellow wounded to the death , and cometh towards him with a great sweep and breaketh his spear upon his shield 
howbeit , lancelot beareth him to the ground right over his horsecroup and maketh him fall so heavily that he breaketh one of his legs 
the tidings are come to the lady of the caste that a knight hath come to the pass that hath slain one of her knights and wounded the other 
the lady is come thither , and bringeth two of her damsels with her 
she seeth lancelot that is fain to slay the knight that lieth wounded on the ground 
sir , saith the lady to lancelot , withdrw yourself back and slay him not , but alight and speak to me in safety 
lady , saith one of the maidens , i know him well 
this is lancelot of the lake , the mostcourteous knight that is in the court of king arthur 
he alighteth and cometh before the lady 
lady , saith he , what is your pleasure 
i desire , saith she , that you come to my hostl to harbour , and that you make me amends of the shame you have done me 
vii 
lady , saith lancelot , shame have i never done you nor shall do , but the knights took in hand too shameful a business when they were minded to take the beards of stanger knights by force 
sir , saith she , i will forego mine illwill on condition that you harbour herewithin tonight 
lady , saith lancelot , i desire not your illwill , wherefore will i gladly do your pleasure 
he setteth him within the caste and maketh his horse be led in after him , and the lady hath the dead knight brought into the chapel and buried 
the other she biddeth be disarmed and clothed and commandeth that his wounds be searched 
maketh she lancelot be disarmed and clad right richly in a good robe , and telleth him that she knoweth well who he is 
lady , saith lancelot , it is well for me 
thereupon they sit to eat , and the firstcourse is brought in by knights in chains that had their noses cut off 
the second by knights in chains that had their eyes put out 
wherefore they were led in by squires 
the third course was brought in by knights that had but one hand and were in chains 
after that , came other knights that had each but one foot and brought in the fourth course 
at the fifth course came knights right fair and tall , and each brought a naked sword in his hand and presented their heads to the lady 
viii 
lancelot beheld the martyrdom of these knights , and sore misliking had he of the services of such folk 
they are risen from meat and the lady goeth to her chamber and sitteth on a couch 
lancelot , saith the lady , you have seen the justce and the lordship of my caste 
all these knights have been conquered at the passing of my door 
lady , saith lancelot , foul mischance hath befallen them 
the like mischance would have befallen you had you not been knight so good 
greatly have i desired to see you this long time past  and i will make you lord of this caste and myself 
lady , saith he , the lordship of this caste hold i of yourself without mesne , and to you have i neither wish nor right to refuse it 
rather am i willing to be at your service 
saith she , you will abide with me in this caste , for more do i love you than any other knight that liveth 
lady , saith lancelot , gramercy , but in no caste may i abide more than one night until i have been thither whither behoveth me to go 
whither are you bound 
saith she 
lady , saith he , to the caste of souls 
well know i the caste , saith she 
the king hath the name fisherman , and lieth in languishment on account of two knights that have been at his caste and made not good demand 
would you fain go thither 
saith the lady 
yea , saith lancelot 
pledge me your faith that you will return by me to speak to me , so the graal shall appear to you and you ask whereof it serveth 
yea , truly , saith lancelot , were you beyond sea 
sir , saith one of the damsels , so much may you well promise , for the graal appeareth not to no knight so wanton as be ye 
for you love the queen guenievre , the wife of your lord , king arthur , nor so long as this love lieth at your heart may you never behold the graal 
ix 
lancelot heard the damsel and blushed of despite 
ha , lancelot , saith the lady , love you other than me 
lady , saith he , the damsel may say her pleasure 
lancelot lay the night at the caste , and right wroth was he of the damsel that calleth the love of him and the queen disloyal 
the morrow when he had heard mass , he took leave of the lady of the caste , and she besought him over and over to keep his covenant , and he said that so would he do without fail 
therewithal he issueth forth of the caste and entereth into a tall and ancient forest and rideth the day long until he cometh to the outskirt of the forest and seeth a tall cross at the entrance of a buryingground enclosed all round about with a hedge of thorns 
the way lay through the burying ground 
lancelot entered therein and the night was come 
he seeth the graveyard full of tombs and sepulchres 
he looketh behind and seeth a chapel wherein were candles burning 
thitherward goeth he , and passeth beyond without saying aught more by the side of a dwarf that was digging a grave in the ground 
lancelot , saith the dwarf , you are right not to salute me , for you are the man of all the world that mosti hate 
god grant me vengeance of your body 
will he what time you are sticken down here within 
lancelot heard the dwarf , but deigned not to answer him of nought 
he is come to the chapel , and alighteth and maketh fastthe bridle of his horse to a tree , and leaneth his shield and spear without 
after that he entereth into the chapel , and findeth a damsel laying out a knight in his windingsheen 
as soon as lancelot was entered therewithin the wounds of the knight were swollen up and began to bleed afresh 
ha , sir knight , now see i plainly that you slew him that i am wrapping in his windingsheet 
x 
thereupon , behold you , two knights that are carrying other two knights dead 
they alight and then set them in the chapel 
the dwarf crieth out to them  now shall it be seen how you avenge your friends of the enemy that fell upon you 
the knight that had fled from the forestwhen messire gawain came thither where the three lay dead , was come therewithin and knew lancelot , whereupon saith he  our mortal enemy are you , for by you were these three knights slain 
well had they deserved it , saith lancelot , and in this chapel am i in no peril of you , wherefore as at this time will i depart not hence , for i know not the ways of the forest he was in the chapel until the day broke , when he issued forth thereof , and sore it weighed upon him that his horse was stll fastng 
he taketh his arms and is mounted 
the dwarf crieth out aloud  what aileth you 
saith he to the two knights , will you let your mortal enemy go thus 
with that the two knights mount their horses and go to the two issues of the graveyard , thinking that lancelot is fain to flee therefrom 
no desire hath he thereof , wherefore he cometh to the knight that was guarding the entrance whereby he had to issue out , and smiteth him so stffly that he thrustth the point of his spear right through his body 
the other knight that was guarding the other entrance , that had fled out of the forestbefore , had no mind to avenge his fellow , and fled incontinent so fastas he might 
lancelot taketh the horse of the knight he had slain and drveth him before him , for he thinketh that some knight may haply have need thereof 
he rideth on until he cometh to a hermitage in the forestwhere he alighteth and hath his horses stbled , and the hermit giveth them of the besthe hath 
lancelot heard mass , and afterward are a little and fell on sleep 
thereafter , behold you , a knight that cometh to the hermit and seeth lancelot that was about to mount 
sir , saith he , whither go you 
sir knight , saith lancelot , thither shall i go where god may please 
you , whitherward are you bound to go 
sir , i go to see one of my brethren and my two sistrs , for i have been told that he hath fallen on such mishap as that he is called the poor knight , whereof am i sore sorrowful 
certes , saith lancelot , poor he is , the more the pity 
howbeit , will you do him a message from me 
sir , saith the knight , right willingly 
will you present him with this horse on my behalf , and tell him how lancelot that harboured with him hath sent it 
sir , saith the knight , right great thanks , and blessed may you be , for he that doth a kindness to a worshipful man loseth it not 
salute the two damsels for me , saith lancelot 
sir , right willingly 
the knight delivereth the horse to his squire , and taketh leave of lancelot 
xi 
thereupon , lancelot departeth from the hermitage and rideth on until he cometh forth of the forest and findeth a wast land , a country broad and long wherein wonned neither beastnor bird , for the land was so poor and parched that no victual was to be found therein 
lancelot looketh before him and seeth a city appear far away 
thither rideth he full speed and seeth that the city is so great that it seemeth him to encompass a whole country 
he seeth the walls that are falling all around , and the gates ruined with age 
he entereth within and findeth the city all void of folk , and seeth the great palaces fallen down and wast , and the great graveyards full of sepulchres , and the tall churches all lying wast , and the markets and exchanges all empty 
he rideth amidstthe steets , and findeth a great palace that seemeth him to be better and more ancient than all the others 
he bideth awhile before it and heareth within how knights and ladies are making great dole 
they say to a knight  ha , god , sore grief and pity is this of you , that you mustneeds die in such manner , and that your death may not be respited 
re hatred ought we to bear toward him that hath adjudged you such a death 
the knights and ladies swoon over him as he departeth 
lancelot hath heard all this and much marvelleth he thereof , but nought thereof may he see 
xii 
thereupon , lo you , the knight that cometh down into the midstof the hall , clad in a short red jerkin 
he was girt with a rich girdle of gold , and had a rich clasp at his neck wherein were many rich stnes , and on his head had he a great cap of gold , and he held great axe 
the knight was of great comeliness and young of age 
lancelot seeth him coming , and looketh upon him right fainly when he seeth him appear 
the knight saith to him , sir , alight 
certes , saith lancelot , willingly 
he alighteth and maketh his horse fastto a ring of silver that was on the mountingstge , and putteth his shield from his neck and his spear from his hand 
sir , saith he to the knight , what is your pleasure 
sir , needs mustyou cut me off my head with this axe , for of this weapon hath my death been adjudged , but and you will not , i will cut off your own therewith 
hold , sir , saith lancelot , what is this you tell me 
sir , saith the knight , you mustneeds do even as i say , sith that you are come into this city 
sir , saith lancelot , right foolish were he that in such a jeopardy should not do the bestfor himself , but blamed shall i be thereof and i shall slay you when you have done me no wrong 
certes , saith the knight , in no otherwise may you go hence 
fair sir , saith lancelot , so gentle are you and so well nurtured , how cometh it that you take your death so graciously 
you know well that i shall kill you before you shall kill me , sith that so it is 
this know i well for true , saith the knight , but you will promise me before i die , that you will return into this city within a year from this , and that you will set your head in the same jeopardy without challenge , as i have set mine 
by my head , saith lancelot , needeth no argument that i shall choose respite of death to dying here on the spot 
i marvel me of this that you are so fairly apparelled to receive your death 
xiii 
sir , saith the knight , he that would go before the saviour of the world ought of right to apparel him as fairly as he may 
i am by confession purged of all wickedness and of all the misdeeds that ever i have committed , and do repent me truly thereof , wherefore at this moment am i fain to die 
therewithal he holdeth forth the axe , and lancelot taketh it and seeth that it is right keen and well whetted 
sir , saith the knight , hold up your hand toward the minstr that you see yonder 
sir , saith lancelot , willingly 
thus , then , will you swear to me upon the holy relics that are within this minstr , that on this day year at the hour that you shall have slain me , or before , you yourself will come back here and place your head in the very same peril as i shall have placed mine , without default 
thus , saith lancelot , do i swear and give you thereto my pledge 
with that , the knight kneeleth and stetcheth his neck as much as he may , and lancelot taketh the axe in his hands , and then saith to him , sir knight , for god s sake , have mercy on yourself 
let cut off my head 
saith the knight , for otherwise may i not have mercy upon you 
in god s name , saith lancelot , fain would i deny you 
with that , he swingeth the axe and cutteth off the head with such a sweep that he maketh it fly seven foot high from the body 
the knight fell to the ground when his head was cut off , and lancelot flung down the axe , and thinketh that he will make but an ill sty there for himself 
he cometh to his horse , and taketh his arms and mounteth and looketh behind him , but seeth neither the body of the knight nor the head , neither knoweth he what hath become of them all , save only that he heard much dole and a great cry far off in the city of knights and ladies , saying that he shall be avenged , please god , at the term set , or before 
lancelot hath heard and understod all that the knights say and the ladies , and issueth forth of the city 
branch viii 
of the mostholy graal here beginneth another branch in such wise as the authority witnesseth and joseph that made recoverance thereof , in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
this high histry and profitable witnesseth us that the son of the widow lady sojourned stll with his uncle king pelles in the hermitage , and through distess of the evil that he had had since he came forth of the house of king fisherman , was he confessed to his uncle and told him of what lineage he was , and that his name was perceval 
the good hermit the good king had given him the name of parluifet , for that he was made of himself 
king hermit was one day gone into the forest and the good knight parluifet felt himself sounder of health and luster than he wont to be 
he heard the birds sing in the forest and his heart began to swell of knighthood , and he minded him of the adventures he wont to find in the forestand of the damsels and knights that he wont to meet , and never was he so fain of arms as was he at that time , for that he had been sojourning so long within doors 
he felt courage in his heart and lustness in his limbs and fainness in his thought 
right soon armeth he himself and setteth the saddle on his horse and mounteth forthwith 
he prayeth god give him adventure that he may meet good knight , setteth himself forth of his uncle s hermitage and entereth into the forestthat was broad and shady 
he rideth until he cometh into a launde that was right spacious , and seeth a leafy tree that was at the head of the launde 
he alighteth in the shadow , and thinketh to himself that two knights might jouston this bit of ground fair and well , for the place was right broad 
even as he was thinking on this wise , he heard a horse neigh full loud in the forestthree times , and right glad was he thereof and said  ha , god , of your sweetness grant that there be a knight with that horse , so may i prove whether there be any force or valour or knighthood in me 
for i know not now what stength i may have , nor even whether my heart be sound and my limbs whole 
for on a knight that hath neither hardihood nor valour in himself , may not another knight that hath more force in him reasonably prove his mettle , for many a time have i heard say that one is better than other 
for this pray i to the saviour and this be a knight that cometh there , that he may have stength and hardihood and mettle to defend his body againstmine own , for great desire have i to run upon him 
grant now that he slay me not , nor i him 
ii 
therewithal , he looketh before him , and seeth the knight issue from the forestand enter into the launde 
the knight was armed and had at his neck a white shield with a cross of gold 
he carried his lance low , and sate upon a great destier and rode at a swift pace 
as soon as perceval seeth him , he stadieth him in his strrups and setteth spear in restand smiteth his horse with his spurs , right joyous , and goeth toward the knight a great gallop 
he crieth  sir knight , cover you of your shield to guard you as i do of mine to defend my body , for you do i defy on this side slaying , and our lord god grant that i find you so good knight as shall try what hardihood of heart i may have , for i am not such as i have been aforetime , and better may one learn of a good knight than of a bad 
with that he smiteth the knight upon his shield with such a sweep that he maketh him lose one of his strrups and pierceth his shield above the boss , and passeth beyond full speed 
the knight marvelleth much , and maketh demand , saying , fair sir , what misdeed have i done you 
perceval is silent , and hath no great joy of this that he hath not overthrown the knight , but not so easy was he to overthrow , for he was one of the knights of the world that could mostof defence of arms 
he goeth toward perceval as fastas his horse may carry him and perceval toward him 
they mell together upon their shields right stffly , so that they pierce and batter them with the points of their spears 
perceval thrustth his spear into the flesh two fingerbreadths , and the knight doth not amiss , for he passeth his spear right through his arm so that the shafts of the lances were splintered 
they hurtle together either againstother at the passing so mightily , that the flinders of iron from the mail of their habergeons stck into their foreheads and faces , and the blood leapeth forth by mouth and nose so that their habergeons were all bloody 
they drw their swords with a right great sweep 
the knight of the white shield holdeth perceval s rein and saith  gladly would i know who you are and wherefore you hate me , for you have wounded me right sore , and strdy knight have i found you and of great stength 
perceval saith not a word to him and runneth again upon him sword drwn , and the knight upon him , and right great buffets either giveth other on the helm , so that their eyes all sparkle of strs and the forestresoundeth of the clashing of their swords 
right tough was the battle and right horrible , for good knights were both twain 
the blood that ran down from their wounds at lastslackened their sinews , albeit the passing great wrath that the one had againstthe other , and the passing great heat of their will , had so enchafed them they scarce remembered the wounds that they had , and stll dealt each other great buffets without sparing 
iii 
king hermit cometh from labouring in the forestand findeth not his nephew in the hermitage , whereof is he right sorrowful , and he mounteth on a white mule that he had therewithin 
she was strred in the midstof her forehead with a red cross 
josephus the good clerk witnesseth us that this same mule had belonged to joseph of abarimacie at the time he was pilate s soldier , and that he bequeathed her to king pelles 
king hermit departeth from the hermitage and prayeth god grant him to find his nephew 
he goeth through the forestand rideth until he drweth nigh the launde where the two knights were 
he heareth the stokes of the swords , and cometh towards them full speed and setteth him between the twain to forbid them 
ha , sir , saith he to the knight of the white shield , right great ill do you to combat againstthis knight that hath lain sick this long time in this forest and fight sorely have you wounded him 
sir , saith theknight , as much hath he done by me , and never would i have run upon him now had he not challenged me , and he is not minded to tell me who he is nor whence ariseth his hatred of me 
fair sir , saith the hermit , and you , who are you 
sir , saith the knight , i will tell you 
i am the son of king ban of benoic 
ha , fair nephew , saith king hermit to perceval , see here your cousin , for king ban of benoic was your father s cousingerman 
make him right great cheer 
he maketh them take off their helmets and lower their ventails , and then kiss one another , afterward he leadeth them to his hermitage 
they alight together 
he calleth his own squire that waited upon him , and made them be disarmed right tenderly 
there was a damsel within that was cousingerman to king pelles and had tended perceval within in his sickness 
she washeth their wounds right sweetly and cleanseth them of the blood 
they see that lancelot is sorer wounded than perceval 
damsel , saith the hermit , how seemeth you 
sir , saith she , needs mustthis knight sojourn here , for his wound is in a right perilous place 
hath he danger of death 
sir , saith she , in no wise of this wound , but behoveth him take good heed thereto 
god be praised 
saith he , and of my nephew how seemeth you 
sir , the wound that he hath will be soon healed 
he will have none ill thereof 
iv 
the damsel , that was right cunning of leechcraft , tended the wounds of the knights , and made them whole as bestshe might , and king hermit himself gave counsel therein 
and perceval had borne his shield that was there within , of sinople with a white hart , lancelot would have known him well , nor would there have been any quarrel between them , for he had heard tell of this shield at the court of king arthur 
the authority of this stry recordeth that the two knights are in hermitage , and that perceval is wellnigh whole 
lancelot hath sore pain of his wound and is stll far from his healing 
branch ix 
title i 
now the stry is silent about the two knights for a little time , and speaketh of the squire that messire gawain meeteth in the midstof the forest that told him he went seek the son of the widow lady that had slain his father 
the squire saith that he will go to avenge him , wherefore cometh he to the court of king arthur , for that he had heard tell how all good knights repaired thither 
he seeth the shield hang on the column in the midstof the hall that the damsel of the car had brought thither 
the squire knoweth it well , and kneeleth before the king and saluteth him , and the king returneth his salute and asketh who he is 
sir , saith he , i am the son of the knight of the red shield of the forestof shadows , that was slain of the knight that ought to bear the shield that hangeth on this column , wherefore would i right gladly hear tidings of him 
as gladly would i , saith the king , so that no evil came to him thereof , for he is the knight of the world that i mostdesire 
sir , saith the squire , well behoveth me to hate him for that he slew my father 
he that ought to bear this shield was squire when he slew him , wherefore am i the more sorrowful for that i thought to be avenged upon him squire 
this i may not do , wherefore i pray you for god s sake that you will make me knight , for the like favour are you accustmed to grant unto others 
what is your name , fair friend 
saith the king 
sir , saith he , i am called clamados of the shadows 
messire gawain that had repaired to court , was in the hall , and said to the king  if this squire be enemy of the good knight that ought to bear this shield , behoveth you not set forward his mortal enemy but rather set him back , for he is the bestknight of the world and the mostchast that liveth in the world and of the mostholy lineage , and therefore have you sojourned right long time in this caste to await his coming 
i say not this for the hindering of the squire s advancement , but that you may do nought whereof the good knight may have cause of complaint againstyou 
messire gawain , saith queen guenievre , well know i that you love my lord s honour , but sore blame will he have if he make not this one knight , for so much hath he never refused to do for any 
nor yet will the good knight have any misliking thereof , for greater shame should he have , and greater despite of the hatred of a squire than of a knight 
for never yet was good knight that was not prudent and welladvised and slow to take offence 
wherefore i tell you that he will assuredly listn to reason , and i commend my lord the rather that he make him knight , for much blame would he have of gainsaying him 
lady , saith messire gawain , so you are content , i am happy 
the king made him knight right richly , and when he was clad in the robes , they of the court declare and witness that never this long time pasthad they seen at the court knight of greater comeliness 
he sojourned therein long time , and  , was much honoured of the king and all the barons 
he was every day on the watch for the good knight that should come for the shield , but the hour and the place were not as yet 
ii 
when he saw that he did not come , he took leave of the king and the queen and all them of the court , and departed , thinking him that he would go prove his knighthood in some place until he should have heard tidings of his mortal enemy 
he rideth amidstthe great forest bearing a red shield like as did his father , and he was all armed as for defending of his body 
a long space of time he rideth , until one day he cometh to the head of a forest and he espied his way that ran between two mountains and saw that he had to pass along the midstof the valley that lay at a great depth 
he looketh before him and seeth a tree far away from him , and underneath were three damsels alighted , and one prayed god right heartily aloud that he would send them betimes a knight that durstconvoy them through this stait pass 
iii 
clamodos heareth the damsel and cometh thitherward 
when they espied him , great joy have they thereof and rise up to meet him 
sir , say they , welcome may you be 
damsels , saith he , good adventure may you have 
whom await you here 
saith he 
we await , saith the mistess of the damsels , some knight that shall clear this pass , for no knight durstpass hereby 
what is the pass 
damsel 
saith he 
it is the one of a lion , and a lion , moreover , so fell and horrible that never was none seen more cruel 
there is a knight with the lion between the two mountains that is right good knight and hardy and comely 
howbeit none durstpass without great company of folk 
the knight that hath repair with the lion is seldom there , for so he were there we need fear no danger , for much courtesy is there in him and valour 
the knight looketh and seeth in the shadow of the forestthree fair stgs harnessed to a car 
ha , saith he , you are the damsel of the car , wherefore may you well tell me tidings of the knight of whom i am in quest who is he 
saith the damsel 
it is he that should bear a shield banded argent and azure with a red cross 
of him am i likewise in quest saith the damsel 
please god , we shall hear tidings of him betimes 
damsel saith the knight , that would i 
for that you are in questof him as am i likewise , i will convoy you beyond this pass 
the damsel maketh her car go on before , and the damsels go before the knight 
so enter they into the field of the lion , and right fair land found they therewithin 
clamados looketh and seeth the hall within an enclosure and seeth the lion that lay at the entrance of the gateway 
as soon as he espieth clamados and the damsels , he cometh toward them full speed , mouth open and ears pricked up 
sir , saith the damsel , and you defend not your horse on foot , he is dead at the firstonset 
iv 
clamados is alighted to his feet , by her counsel , and holdeth his spear in his fist and the lion rampeth toward him all in a fury 
clamados receiveth him on the point of his spear , and smiteth him therewith so stutly that it passeth a fathom beyond his neck 
he drweth back his spear without breaking it , and thinketh to smite him again 
the lion cheateth him , and arising himself on his two hinder feet , setteth his fore feet on his shoulders , then huggeth him toward him like as one man doth another 
the grip was sore grievous , for he rendeth his habergeon in twain and so teareth away as much flesh as he can claw hold on 
v 
when clamados felt himself wounded , he redoubled his hardihood , and grippeth the lion so staitly to him that he wringeth a huge roar out of him , and then flingeth him to the ground beneath him 
he drweth his sword and thrustth it to the heart right through the breast  the lion roareth so loud that all the mountains resound thereof 
clamados cutteth off his head and goeth to hang it at the door of the hall 
he cometh back to his horse and mounteth the besthe may 
the damsel saith to him , sir , you are sore wounded 
damsel , said he , please god , i shall take no hurt thereof 
thereupon , behold you a squire that issueth forth of the hall and cometh after him full speed 
hold , sir knight , saith he 
foul wrong have you wrought , for you have slain the lion of the mostcourteous knight that may be known , and the fairestand mostvaliant of this kingdom , and in his despite have you hung the head at his door 
right passing great outrage have you done hereby 
fair sweet friend , saith clamados , it may well be that the lord is right courteous , but the lion was rascal and would have slain me and them that were passing by 
your lord loved him so much he should have chained him up , for better liketh me that i slew him than that he should slay me 
sir , saith the squire , there is no road this way , for it is a forbidden land whereof certain would fain reave my lord , and it was againstthe coming of his enemies that the lion was allowed forth unchained 
what name hath your lord , fair friend 
saith clamados 
sir , he is called meliot of logres , and he is gone in questof messire gawain , of whom he holdeth the land , for right dear is he to him 
messire gawain , saith clamados , left i at the court of king arthur , but behoveth him depart thence or ever i return thither 
by my head , saith the squire , faith would i you might meet them both twain , if only my lord knew that you had slain him his lion 
fair friend , saith clamados , and he be as courteous as you say , no misliking will he have of me thereof , for i slew him in defending mine own body , and god forbid i should meet any that would do me evil therefor 
vi 
thereupon the knight and the damsels depart and pass the narrow stait in the lion s field , and ride on until they drw nigh a right rich caste seated in a meadowland surrounded of great waters and high forest , and the caste was always void of folk 
they were fain to turn thitherward , but they met a squire that told them that in the caste was not a soul , albeit and they would ride forward they would find great plenty of folk 
far forward have they ridden that they are come to the head of a forestand see great foison of tents stetched right in the midstof a launde , and they were compassed round of a great white sheet that seemed from afar to be a long white wall with crenels , and it was a good league welsh in length 
they came to the entrance of the tents and heard great joy within , and when they had entered they saw dames and damsels , whereof was great plenty , and of right passing great beauty were they 
clamados alighteth , that was right sore wounded 
the damsel of the car was received with right great joy 
two of the damsels come to clamados , of whom make they right great joy 
afterward they lead him to a tent and made disarm him 
they washed his wounds right sweetly and tenderly 
they brought him a right rich robe and made him be apparelled therein , and led him before the ladies of the tents , that made right great joy of him 
vii 
lady , saith the damsel of the car , this knight hath saved my life , for he hath slain the lion on account of which many folk durstnot come to you , wherefore make great joy of him 
greater joy may i not make , than i do , nor the damsels that are herein , for we await the coming of the good knight that is healed , from day to day 
now is there nought in the world i more desire to see 
lady , saith clamados , who is this good knight 
the son of the widow lady of the valleys of camelot , saith she 
tell me , lady , do you say that he will come hither presently 
methinketh , saith she 
lady , i also shall have great joy thereof , and god grant he come betimes 
sir knight , saith she , what is your name 
lady saith he , i am called clamados , and i am son of the lord of the forestof shadows 
she throweth her arms on his neck and kisseth and embraceth him right sweetly , and saith  marvel not that i make you joy thereof , for you are the son of my sistrinlaw , nor have i any friend nor bloodkindrd so nigh as are you , and fain would i you should be lord of all my land and of me , as is right and reason 
the damsels of the tents make right great joy of him when they know the tidings that he is so nigh of kin to the lady of the tents 
he sojourned therewithin until that he was whole and heal , awaiting the coming of the knight of whom he had heard the tidings 
the damsels marvel them much that he cometh not , for the damsel that had tended him was therewithin and telleth them that he was healed of his arm , but that lancelot is not yet whole , wherefore he is stll within the hermitage 
viii 
this high histry witnesseth us and recordeth that joseph , who maketh remembrance thereof , was the firstpriestthat sacrificed the body of our lord , and forsomuch ought one to believe the words that come of him 
you have heard tell how perceval was of the lineage of joseph of abarimacie , whom god so greatly loved for that he took down his body hanging on the cross , which he would not should lie in the prison there where pilate had set it 
for the highness of the lineage whereof the good knight was descended ought one willingly to hear brought to mind and recorded the words that are of him 
the stry telleth us that he was departed of the hermitage all sound and whole , albeit he hath left lancelot , for that his wound was not yet healed , but he hath promised him that he will come back to him so soon as he may 
he rideth amidsta forest all armed , and cometh toward evensong to the issue of the forestand seeth a caste before him right fair and well seated , and goeth thitherward for lodging , for the sun was set 
he entereth into the caste and alighteth 
the lord cometh to meet him that was a tall knight and a red , and had a felon look , and his face scarred in many places 
knight was there none therewithin save only himself and his household 
ix 
when he seeth perceval alighted , he runneth to bar the door , and perceval cometh over againsthim 
for all greeting , the knight saluteth him thus  now shall you have , saith he , such guerdon as you have deserved 
never again shall you depart hence , for my mortal enemy are you , and right hardy are you thus to throw yourself upon me , for you slew my brother the lord of the shadows , and chaos the red am i that war upon your mother , and this caste have i reft of her 
in like manner will i wring the life out of you or ever you depart hence 
already , saith perceval , have i thrown myself on this your hostl to lodge with you , wherefore to blame would you be to do me evil 
lodge me this night as behoveth one knight do for another , and on the morrow at departing let each do the besthe may 
by my head 
saith chaos the red , mortal enemy of mine will i never harbour here save i harbour him dead 
he runneth to the hall above , and armeth himself as swiftly as he may , and taketh his sword all naked in his hand and cometh back to the place where perceval was , right full of anguish of heart for this that he said , that he would war upon his mother and had reft her of this caste 
he flung his spear to the ground , and goeth toward him on foot and dealeth him a huge buffet above the helmet upon the coif of his habergeon , such that he cleaveth the mail and cutteth off two fingers breadth of the flesh in such sort that he made him reel three times round 
x 
when chaos the red felt himself wounded , he was sore grieved thereof , and cometh toward perceval and stiketh him a great buffet above in the midstof his helmet , so that he made the sparks fly and his neck stop and his eyes sparkle of strs 
the blow slippeth down on to the shield , so that it is cleft right down to the boss 
perceval felt his neck stff and heavy , and feeleth that the knight is strdy and of great might 
he cometh back towards him , and thinketh to stike him above in the midstof his head , but chaos swerved aside from him 
howbeit perceval reached him and caught his right arm and cutteth it sheer from his side , sword and all , and sendeth it flying to the ground , and chaos runneth upon him , thinking to grapple him with his left arm , but his force was waning 
nathless right gladly would he have avenged himself and he might 
howbeit , perceval setteth on him again that loved him not in his heart , and smiteth him again above on the head , and dealeth him such a buffet as maketh his brains be all toscattered abroad 
his household and servants were at the windows of the hall 
when they see that their lord is nigh to the death , they cry to perceval  sir , you have slain the hardiestknight in the kingdom of logres , and him that was mostredoubted of his enemies 
we can do no otherwise 
we know well that this caste is your mother s and ought to be yours 
we challenge it not 
wherefore may you do your will of whatsoever there is in the caste 
allow us to go to our lord that there lieth dead , and take away the body and set it in some seemly place for the sake of his good knighthood , and for that it behoveth us so to do 
readily do i grant it you , saith perceval 
they bear the body to a chapel , then they disarm him and wind him in his shroud 
after that they lead perceval into the hall and disarm him and say to him  sir , you may be well assured that there be none but us twain herewithin and two damsels , and the doors are barred , and behold , here are the keys which we deliver up to you 
i command you , saith perceval , that you go staightway to my mother , and tell her that she shall see me betimes and i may get done , and so salute her and tell her i am sound and whole 
what is the name of this caste 
sir , it hath for name the key of wales , for it is the gateway of the land 
xi 
perceval lay the night in the caste he had reconquered for his mother , and the morrow , when he was armed , he departed 
these promised that they would keep the caste loyally and would deliver it up to his mother at her will 
he rode until he came to the tents where the damsels were , and drw rein and listned 
there was not so great joy as when the damsel that rode like a knight and led the car came thither with clamados 
great dole heard he that was made , and beating of palms 
wherefore he bethought him what folk they might be 
natheless he was not minded to drw back without entering 
he alighted in the midstof the tents and set down his shield and his spear , and seeth the damsels wringing their hands and tearing their hair , and much marvelleth he wherefore it may be 
a damsel cometh forward that had set forth from the caste where he had slain the knight  sir , to your shame and ill adventure may you have come hither 
perceval looketh at her and marvelleth much of that she saith , and she crieth out  lady , behold here him that hath slain the bestknight of your lineage 
you , clamados , that are within there , he hath slain your father and your uncle 
now shall it be seen what you will do 
the damsel of the car cometh thitherward and knoweth perceval by the shield that he bare of sinople with a white hart 
sir , saith she , welcome may you be 
let who will make dole , i will make joy of your coming 
xii 
therewith the damsel leadeth him into a tent and maketh him sit on a right rich couch 
afterward she maketh him be disarmed of her two damsels and clad in a right rich robe 
she leadeth him to the queen of the tents that was stll making great dole 
lady , saith the damsel of the car , stnt your sorrow , for behold , here is the good knight on whose account were the tents here pitched , and on whose account no less have you been making this great joy right up to this very day 
ha , saith she , is this then the son of the widow lady 
yea , certes , saith the damsel 
ha , saith the lady , he hath slain me the bestknight of all my kin , and the one that protected me from mine enemies 
lady , saith the damsel , this one will be better able to protect and defend us , for the bestknight is he of the world and the comeliest the queen taketh him by the hand and maketh him sit beside her 
sir , saith she , howsoever the adventure may have befallen , my heart biddeth me make joy of your coming 
lady , saith he , gramercy 
chaos would fain have slain me within his caste , and i defended myself to my power 
the queen looketh at him amidsthis face , and is taken with a love of him so passing stong and fervent that she goeth nigh to fall upon him 
sir , saith she , and you will grant me your love , i will pardon you of all the death of chaos the red 
lady , saith he , your love am i right fain to deserve , and mine you have 
sir , saith she , how may i perceive that you love me 
lady , saith he , i will tell you 
there is no knight in the world that shall desire to do you a wrong , but i will help you againsthim to my power 
such love , saith she , is the common love that knight ought to bear to lady 
would you do as much for another 
lady , saith he , it well may be , but more readily shall a man give help in one place than in another 
the queen would fain that perceval should pledge himself to her further than he did , and the more she looketh at him the better he pleaseth her , and the more is she taken with him and the more desirous of his love 
perceval never once thought of loving her or another in such wise 
he was glad to look upon her , for that she was of passing great beauty , but never spake he nought to her whereby she might perceive that he loved her of inward love 
in no wise might she refrain her heart , nor withdrw her eyes , nor lose her desire 
the damsels looked upon her with wonder that so soon had she forgotten her mourning 
xiii 
thereupon , behold you clamados , that had been told that this was the knight that , as yet only squire , had slain his father and put chaos his uncle to death 
he cometh into the tent and seeth him sitting beside the queen , that looked at him right sweetly 
lady , saith he , great shame do you to yourself , in that you have seated at your side your own mortal enemy and mine 
never again henceforth ought any to have affiance in your love nor in your help 
clamados , saith the queen , the knight hath thrown himself upon me suddenly 
wherefore ought i do him no evil , rather behoveth me lodge him and keep his body in safety 
nought , moreover , hath he done whereof he might be adjudged of murder nor of treason 
lady , saith clamados , he slew my father in the lonely forestwithout defiance , and treacherously casta javelin at him and smote him through the body , wherefore shall i never be at ease until i have avenged him 
therefore do i appeal and pray you to do me my right , not as being of your kindrd , but as stanger 
for right willing am i that kinship shall avail me nought herein 
perceval looketh at the knight and seeth that he is of right goodly complexion of body and right comely of face 
fair sir , saith he , as of treason i would that you hold me quit , for never toward your father nor toward other have had i never a mind to do treason , and god defend me from such shame , and grant me stength to clear myself of any blame thereof 
clamados cometh forward to proffer his gage 
by my head , saith the queen , not this day shall gage be received herein 
tomorrow will come day , and counsel therewith , and then shall fight be done to each 
clamados is moved of right great wrath , but the queen of the tents showeth perceval the mosthonour she may , whereof is clamados right heavy , and saith that never ought any to put his trustin woman 
wrongly he blameth her therein , for she did it of the passing great love she hath for perceval , inasmuch as well she knoweth that he is the bestknight of the world and the comeliest  but it only irketh her the more that she may not find in him any sign of special liking toward herself neither in deed nor word , whereof is she beyond measure sorrowful 
the knights and damsels lay the night in the tents until the morrow , and went to hear mass in a chapel that was in the midstof the tents 
xiv 
when mass was sung , staightway behold you , a knight that cometh all armed , bearing a white shield at his neck 
he alighteth in the midstof the tents and cometh before the queen all armed , and saith  lady , i plain me of a knight that is there within that hath slain my lion , and if you do me not right herein , i will harass you as much or more than i will him , and will harm you in every wise i may 
wherefore i pray and require you , for the love of messire gawain , whose man i am , that you do me right herein 
what is the knight s name 
saith the queen 
lady , saith he , he is called clamados of the shadows , and methinketh i see him yonder , for i knew him when he was squire 
what is your name 
saith the queen 
lady , i am called melior of logres 
clamados , saith the queen , hear you what this knight saith 
yea , lady , saith he 
again i require that you do me right of the knight that slew my father and my uncle 
lady , saith melior , i would fain go 
i know not toward whom the knight proffereth his gage , but him do i appeal of felony for my lion that he hath slain 
he taketh in his hand the skirt of his habergeon  lady , behold here the gage i offer you 
xv 
clamados , saith the queen , hear you then not that which this knight saith 
lady , saith he , i hear him well 
truth it is that i slew his lion , but not until after he had fallen upon me , and made the wounds whereof i have been healed herewithin 
well you know that the knight who came hither lastnight hath done me greater wrong than have i done this other 
wherefore would i pray you that i may take vengeance of him first you hear , saith she , how this knight that hath come hither all armed is fain to go back forthwith 
quit you , therefore , of him first and then will we take thought of the other 
lady , gramercy 
saith meliot , and messire gawain will take it in right good part , for this knight hath slain my lion that defended me from all my enemies 
nor is it true that the entrance to your tent was deserted on account of my lion 
in despite of me hath he hung the head at my gate 
as of the lion , saith the queen , you have no quarrel againsthim and he slew him in defending his body , but as of the despite he did you as you say , when in nought had you done him any wrong , it shall not be that right shalt be denied you in my court , and if you desire to deliver battle , no blame shall you have thereof 
xvi 
clamados maketh arm him and mounteth on his horse , and he seemeth right hardy of his arms and valorous 
he cometh right in the midstof the tent , where the ground was fair and level , and found meilot of logres all armed upon his horse , and a right comely knight was he and a deliver 
the ladies and damsels were round about the tiltingground 
sir , saith the queen to perceval , i will that you keep the field for these knights 
lady , saith he , at your pleasure 
meliot moveth toward clamados right swiftly and clamados toward him , and they melled together on their shields in such sort that they pierced them and cleft the mail of their habergeons asunder with the points of their spears , and the twain are both wounded so that the blood rayeth forth of their bodies 
the knights drw asunder to take their career , for their spears were broken short , and they come back the one toward the other with a great rush , and smite each other on the breastwith their spears so stffly that there is none but should have been pierced within the flesh , for the habergeons might protect them not 
they hurtle againsteach other so stongly that knights and horses fall together to the ground all in a heap 
the queen and the damsels have great pity of the two knights , for they see that they are both so passing sore wounded 
the two knights rise to their feet and hold their swords naked and run the one on the other right wrathfully , with such force as they had left 
sir , saith the queen to perceval , go part these two knights asunder that one slay not the other , for they are sore wounded 
perceval goeth to part them and cometh to meliot of logres 
sir , saith he , withdrw yourself back 
you have done enough 
clamados felt that he was sore wounded in two places , and that the wound he had in his breastwas right great 
he drweth himself back 
the queen is come thither 
fair nephew , saith she , are you badly wounded 
yea , lady , saith clamados 
certes , saith the queen , this grieveth me , but never yet saw i knight and he were desirous of fighting , but came at some time by mischance 
a man may not always stnd on all his rights 
she made him be carried on his shield into a tent , and made search his wounds , and saw that of one had he no need to fear , but that the other was right sore perilous 
xvii 
lady , saith clamados , once more do i pray and require you that you allow not the knight that slew my father to issue forth from hence , save he deliver good hostge that he will come back when i shall be healed 
will i do , sith that it is your pleasure 
the queen cometh to the other knight that was wounded , for that he declareth himself messire gawain s man , and maketh search his wounds , and they say that he hath not been hurt so sore as is clamados 
she commandeth them to tend him and wait upon him right wellwillingly , sir , saith she to perceval , behoveth you abide here until such time as my nephew be heal , for you know well that whereof he plaineth againstyou , nor would i that you should depart hence without clearing you of the blame 
lady , no wish have i to depart without your leave , but rather shall i be ready to clear myself of blame whensoever and wheresoever time and place may be 
herewithin may i make not so long sojourn 
natheless to this will i pledge my word , that i will return thither within a term of fifteen days from the time he shall be whole 
sir , saith the damsel of the car , i will remain here in hostge for you 
do you pray him , saith the queen , that he remain herewithin with us 
xviii 
lady , saith perceval , i may not , for i left lancelot wounded right sore in my uncle s hermitage 
sir , saith the queen , i would fain that remaining here might have pleased you as well as it would me 
lady , saith he , none ought it to displease to be with you , but every man behoveth keep his word as well as he may , and none ought to lie to so good a knight as he 
you promise me , then , saith the queen , that you will return hither the soonestyou may , or at the least within the term appointed after you shall have learnt that clamados is healed , to defend you of the treason that he layeth upon you 
lady , saith he , and if he die shall i be quit 
yea , truly , sir , and so be that you have no will to come for love of me 
for right well should i love your coming 
lady , saith he , never shall be the day my services shall fail you , so i be in place , and you in need thereof 
he taketh leave and departeth , armed 
the damsel of the car commendeth him to god , and perceval departeth full speed and rideth so far on his journeys that he cometh to his uncle s hermitage and entereth in , thinking to find lancelot 
his uncle telleth him that he hath departed all sound and all heal of his wound , as of all other malady , as him thinketh 
branch x 
incipit 
another branch of the graal again beginneth in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
the stry is here silent of perceval , and saith that lancelot goeth his way and rideth by a forestuntil he findeth a caste amidsthis way at the head of a launde , and seeth at the gateway of the caste an old knight and two damsels sitting on a bridge 
thitherward goeth he , and the knight and damsels rise up to meet him , and lancelot alighteth 
sir , saith the vavasour , welcome may you be 
the damsels make great joy of him and lead him into the caste 
sir , saith the vavasour , sore need had we of your coming 
he maketh him go up into the hall above and be disarmed of his arms 
sir , saith the vavasour , now may you see great pity of these two damsels that are my daughters 
a certain man would reave them of this caste for that no aid nor succour have they save of me alone 
little enough can i do , for i am old and feeble , and my kin also are of no avail , insomuch that hitherto have i been able to find no knight that durstdefend me from the knight that is fain to reave this caste from me 
you seem to be of so great valiance that you will defend me well herein tomorrow , for the truce cometh to an end tonight 
how 
saith lancelot , i have but scarce come in hither to lodge , and you desire me so soon already to engage myself in battle 
sir , saith the vavasour , herein may it well be proven whether there be within you as much valour as there seemeth from without to be 
for , and you make good the claim of these two damsels that are my daughters to the fiefs that are of right their own , you will win thereby the love of god as well as praise of the world 
they fall at his feet weeping , and pray him of mercy that they may not be disherited 
he raiseth them forthwith , as one that hath great pity thereof 
damsels , saith he , i will aid you to my power 
i would fain that the term be not long 
sir , say they , tomorrow is the day , and tomorrow , so we have no knight to meet him that challengeth this caste , we shall have lostit 
our father is an old knight , and hath no longer lusthood nor force whereby he might defend it for us , and all of our lineage are fallen and decayed 
this hatred hath fallen on us on account of messire gawain , whom we harboured 
lancelot lay there the night within the caste and was right well lodged and worshipfully entreated 
on the morrow he armed himself when he had heard mass , and leant at the windows of the hall and seeth the gate shut and barred , and heareth a horn sound without the gate three times right loud 
sir , saith the vavasour , the knight is come , and thinketh that within here is no defence 
by my head , saith lancelot , but there is , please god 
the knight bloweth another blastof his horn 
hearken , sir , saith the vavasour , it is nigh noon , and he thinketh him that none will issue hence to meet him 
ii 
lancelot cometh down below and findeth his horse saddled and is mounted as soon 
the damsels are at his strrup , and pray him for god s sake remember to defend the honour that is theirs of the caste , for , save only he so doth , they mustflee like beggars into other lands 
thereupon the knight soundeth his horn again 
lancelot , when he heareth the blast hath no mind to abide longer , and forthwith issueth out of the caste all armed , lance in hand and shield at his neck 
he seeth the knight at the head of the bridge , all armed under a tree 
thitherward cometh lancelot full speed 
the knight seeth him coming , and crieth to him 
sir knight , saith he , what demand you 
come you hither to do me evil 
yea , saith lancelot , for that evil are you fain to do to this caste 
wherefore on behalf of the vavasour and his daughters do i defy you 
he moveth againstthe knight and smiteth him on the shield with his spear and the knight him 
lancelot pierceth his shield for him with his sword , and smiteth him so stffly that he pinneth his arm to his side , and hurtleth againsthim so passing stutly that he thrustth him to the ground , him and his horse , and runneth over him , sword drwn 
ha , saith the knight to lancelot , withdrw a little from over me , and slay me not , and tell me your name , of your mercy 
what have you to do with my name 
saith lancelot 
sir , saith he , gladly would i know it , for a right good knight seem you to be , and so have i well proven in the firstencounter 
sir saith he , i am called lancelot of the lake 
what is your name 
sir 
saith he , i am called marin of the caste of gomeret 
am i  father of meliot of logres 
i pray you , by that you mostlove in the world , that you slay me not 
will i do , saith lancelot , and you renounce not your feud againstthis caste 
by my faith , saith the knight , thus do i renounce it , and i pledge myself that thenceforth for ever shall it have no distrbance of me 
your pledge , saith lancelot , will i not accept save you come in thither 
sir , saith the knight , you have sore wounded me in such sort that i cannot mount but with right great pain 
lancelot helpeth him until he was mounted again on his horse , and leadeth him into the caste with him , and maketh him present his sword to the vavasour and his daughters , and yield up his shield and his arms , and afterward swear upon hallows that never again will he make war upon them 
lancelot thereupon receiveth his pledge to forego all claim to the caste and marin turneth him back to gomeret 
the vavasour and his daughters abide in great joy 
iii 
the stry saith that lancelot went his way by stange lands and by forest to seek adventure , and rode until he found a plain land lying without a city that seemed to be of right great lordship 
as he was riding by the plain land , he looketh toward the forestand seeth the plain fair and wide and the land right level 
he rideth all the plain , and looketh toward the city and seeth great plenty of folk issuing forth thereof 
with them was there much noise of bagpipes and flutes and viols and many instuments of music , and they came along the way wherein was lancelot riding 
when the foremostcame up to him , they halted and redoubled their joy 
sir , say they , welcome may you be 
lords , saith lancelot , whom come ye to meet with such joy 
sir , say they , they that come behind there will tell you clearly that whereof we are in need 
iv 
thereupon behold you the provost and the lords of the city , and they come over againstlancelot 
sir , say they , all this joy is made along of you , and all these instuments of music are moved to joy and sound of gladness for your coming 
wherefore for me , saith lancelot 
that shall you know well betimes , say they 
this city began to burn and to melt in one of the houses from the very same hour that our king was dead , nor might the fire be quenched , nor never will be quenched until such time as we have a king that shall be lord of the city and of the honour thereunto belonging , and on new year s day behoveth him to be crowned in the midstof the fire , and then shall the fire be quenched , for otherwise may it never be put out nor extinguished 
wherefore have we come to meet you to give you the royalty , for we have been told that you are a good knight 
lords , saith lancelot , of such a kingdom have i no need , and god defend me from it 
sir , they say , you may not be defended thereof , for you come into this land at hazard , and great grief would it be that so good land as you see this is were burnt and melted away by the default of one single man , and the lordship is right great , and this will be right great worship to yourself , that on new year s day you should be crowned in the fire and thus save this city and this great people , and thereof shall you have great praise 
v 
much marvelleth lancelot of this that they say 
they come round about him on all sides and lead him into the city 
the ladies and damsels are mounted to the windows of the great houses and make great joy , and say the one to another , look at the new king here that they are leading in 
now will he quench the fire on new year s day 
lord 
say the mostpart , what great pity is it of so comely a knight that he shall end on suchwise 
be stll 
say the others 
rather should there be great joy that so fair city as is this should be saved by his death , for prayer will be made throughout all the kingdom for his soul for ever 
therewith they lead him to the palace with right great joy and say that they will crown him 
lancelot found the palace all stown with rushes and hung about with curtains of rich cloths of silk , and the lords of the city all apparelled to do him homage 
he refuseth right stutly , and saith that their king nor their lord will he never be in no such sort 
thereupon behold you a dwarf that entereth into the city , leading one of the fairestdames that be in any kingdom , and asketh whereof this joy and this murmuring may be 
they tell him they are fain to make the knight king , but that he is not minded to allow them , and they tell him the whole manner of the fire 
vi 
the dwarf and the damsel are alighted , then they mount up to the palace 
the dwarf calleth the provost of the city and the greater lords 
lords , saith he , sith that this knight is not willing to be king , i will be so willingly , and i will govern the city at your pleasure and do whatsoever you have devised to do 
in faith , sith that the knight refuseth this honour and you desire to have it , willingly will we grant it you , and he may go his way and his road , for herein do we declare him wholly quit 
therewithal they set the crown on the dwarf s head , and lancelot maketh great joy thereof 
he taketh his leave , and they command him to god , and so remounteth he on his horse and goeth his way through the midstof the city all armed 
the dames and damsels say that he would not be king for that he had no mind to die so soon 
when he came forth of the city right well pleased was he 
he entereth a great forestand rideth on till daylight began to fall , and seeth before him a hermitage newly stblished , for the house and the chapel were all builded new 
he cometh thitherward and alighteth to lodge 
the hermit , that was young without beard or other hair on his face , issued from his chapel 
sir , saith he to lancelot , you are he that is welcome 
you , sir , good adventure to you , saith lancelot 
never have i seen hermit so young as you 
sir , of this only do i repent me , that i came not hither ere now 
vii 
therewith he maketh his horse be stbled , and leadeth him into his hermitage , and so maketh disarm him and setteth him at ease as much as he may 
sir , saith the hermit , can you tell me any tidings of a knight that hath lain sick of a long time in the house of a hermit 
sir , saith lancelot , it is no long time agone sithence i saw him in the house of the good king hermit , that hath tended me and healed me right sweetly of the wounds that the knight gave me 
is the knight healed , then 
saith the hermit 
yea , sir , saith lancelot , whereof is right great joy 
wherefore do you ask me 
well ought i to ask it , saith the hermit , for my father is king pelles , and his mother is my father s own sistr 
ha , sir , then is the king hermit your father 
yea , sir , certes 
thereof do i love you the better , saith lancelot , for never found i any man that hath done me so much of love as hath he 
what , sir , is your name 
sir , saith he , my name is joseus , and yours , what 
sir , saith he , i am called lancelot of the lake 
sir , saith the hermit , right close are we akin , i and you 
by my head , saith lancelot , hereof am i right glad at heart 
lancelot looketh and seeth in the hermit s house shield and spear , javelins and habergeon 
sir , saith lancelot , what do you with these arms 
sir , saith he , this forestis right lonely , and this hermitage is far from any folk , and none are there herewithin save me and my squire 
when robbers come hither , we defend ourselves therewith 
hermits , methought , never assaulted nor wounded nor slew 
sir , saith the hermit , god forbid i should wound any man or slay 
how , then , do you defend yourselves 
saith lancelot 
sir , i will tell you thereof 
when robbers come to us , we arm ourselves accordingly 
if i may catch hold of any in my hands , he cannot escape me 
our squire is so wellgrown and hardy that he slayeth him forthwith or handleth him in such sort that he may never help himself after 
by my head , saith lancelot , were you not hermit , you would be valiant throughout 
by my head , saith the squire 
you say true , for methinketh there is none so stong nor so hardy as he in all the kingdom of logres 
the lodged lancelot the night the besthe could 
viii 
when as they were in their firstsleep , come four robberknights of the forestthat knew how a knight was lodged therewithin , and had coveted his horse and his arms 
the hermit that was in his chapel saw them first and awoke his squire and made him bring his arms all secretly 
he made his squire arm 
sir , saith the squire , shall i waken the knight 
in nowise , saith the hermit , until such time as we shall know wherefore 
he maketh open the door of the chapel and taketh a great coil of rope , and they issue forth , he and his squire , and they perceived the robbers in the stble where lancelot s horse was 
the hermit crieth out  the squire cometh forward and thereupon beareth one to the ground with his spear 
the hermit seizeth him and bindeth him to a tree so stait that he may not move 
the other three think to defend them and to rescue their fellow 
lancelot leapeth up all strtled when he heareth the noise and armeth himself as quickly as he may , albeit not so quickly but that or ever he come , the hermit hath taken the other three and bound them with the fourth 
of them were some that were wounded right sore 
sir , saith the hermit to lancelot , it grieveth me that you have been awakened 
rather , saith lancelot , have you done me great wrong for that you ought to have awakened me sooner 
sir , saith the hermit , we have assaults such as this often enough 
the four robbers cry mercy of lancelot that he will pray the hermit to have pity upon them 
lancelot saith god help not him that shall have pity on thieves 
as soon as it was daylight , lancelot and the squire led them into the forest their hands all tied behind their backs , and have hanged them in a wast place far away from the hermitage 
lancelot cometh back again and taketh leave of joseus the young hermit , and saith it is great loss to the world that he is not knight 
sir , saith the squire , to me is it great joy , for many a man should suffer thereby 
lancelot is mounted , and joseus commendeth him to god , praying him much that he salute his father and cousin on his behalf , and messire gawain likewise that he met in the forestwhat time he came all weeping to the hermitage 
ix 
lancelot hath set him forth again upon his way , and rideth by the high forest and findeth holds and hermitages enough , but the stry maketh not remembrance of all the hostls wherein he harboured him 
far hath he ridden that he is come forth of the forestand findeth a right fair meadowland all loaded with flowers , and a river ran in the midstthere of that was right fair and broad , and there was forestupon the one side and the other , and the meadow lands were wide and far betwixt the river and the forest  lancelot looketh on the river before him and seeth a man rowing a great boat , and seeth within the boat two knights , white and bald , and a damsel , as it seemed him , that held in her lap the head of a knight that lay upon a mattress of staw and was covered with a coverlid of marten s fur , and another damsel sate at his feet 
there was a knight within in the midstof the boat that was fishing with an angle , the rod whereof seemeth of gold , and right great fish he took 
a little cockboat followed the boat , wherein he set the fish he took 
lancelot cometh anigh the bank the swiftesthe may , and so saluteth the knights and damsels , and they return his salute right sweetly 
lords , saith lancelot , is there no caste nigh at hand nor no harbour 
yea , sir , say they , beyond that mountain , right fair and rich , and this river runneth thither all round about it 
lords , whose caste is it 
sir , say they , it is king fisherman s , and the good knights lodge there when he is in this country 
such knights have been harboured there as that the lord of the land hath had good right to plain him thereof 
the knights go rowing along the river , and lancelot rideth until he cometh to the foot of the mountain and findeth a hermitage beside a spring , and bethinketh him , since it behoveth him to go to so high a hostl and so rich , where the holy graal appeareth , he will confess him to the good man 
he alighteth and confesseth to the good man , and rehearseth all his sins , and saith that of all thereof doth he repent him save only one , and the hermit asketh him what it is whereof he is unwilling to repent 
sir , saith lancelot , it seemeth to me the fairestsin and the sweetestthat ever i committed 
fair sir , saith the hermit , sin is sweet to do , but right bitter be the wages thereof 
neither is there any sin that is fair nor seemly , albeit there be some sins more dradfuller than other 
sir , saith lancelot , this sin will i reveal to you of my lips , but of my heart may i never repent me thereof 
i love my lady , which is the queen , more than aught else that liveth , and albeit one of the bestkings on live hath her to wife 
the affection seemeth me so good and so high that i cannot let go thereof , for , so rooted is it in my heart that thence may it nevermore depart , and the bestknighthood that is in me cometh to me only of her affection 
alas 
saith the hermit , sinner of mortal sin , what is this that you have spoken 
never may no knighthood come of such wantonness that shall not costyou right dear 
a traitor are you toward our earthly lord , and a murderer toward our saviour 
of the seven deadly sins , you are labouring under the one whereof the delights are the falsestof any , wherefore dearly shall you aby thereof , save you repent you forthwith 
sir , saith lancelot , never the more do i desire to castit from me 
as much , saith the hermit , is that as to say that you ought long since to have castit from you and renounced it 
for so long as you maintain it , so long are you an enemy of the saviour 
ha , sir , saith lancelot , she hath in her such beauty and worth and wisdom and courtesy and nobleness that never ought she to be forgotten of any that hath loved her 
x 
the more of beauty and worth she hath in her , saith the hermit , so much the more blame hath she of that she doeth , and you likewise 
for of that which is of little worth is the loss not so great as of that which is much worth 
this is a queen , blessed and anointed , that was thus , therefore , in her beginning vowed to god 
yet now is she given over to the devil of her love for you , and you of your love for her 
fair , sweet my friend , saith the hermit , let go this folly , which is so cruel , that you have taken in hand , and be repentant of these sins 
every day will i pray to the saviour for you , that so truly as he pardoned his death to him that smote him with a lance in his side , so may he pardon you of this sin that you have maintained , and that so you be repentant and truly confessed thereof , i may take the penance due thereunto upon myself 
sir , saith lancelot , i thank you much , but i am not minded to renounce it , nor have i no wish to speak aught wherewith my heart accordeth not 
i am willing enough to do penance as great as is enjoined of this sin , but my lady the queen will i serve so long as it may be her pleasure , and i may have her good will 
dearly do i love her that i wish not even that any will should come to me to renounce her love , and god is so sweet and so full of right merciful mildness , as good men bear witness , that he will have pity upon us , for never no treason have i done toward her , nor she toward me 
ha , fair sweet friend , saith the hermit , nought may you avail you of whatsoever i may say , wherefore god grant her such will and you also , that you may be able to do the will of our saviour 
so much am i fain to tell you , that and if you shall lie in the hostl of king fisherman , yet never may you behold the graal for the mortal sin that lieth at your heart 
may our lord god , saith lancelot , counsel me therein at his pleasure and at his will 
may he do 
saith the hermit , for of a truth you may know thereof am i right fain 
xi 
lancelot taketh leave of the hermit , and is mounted forthwith and departeth from the hermitage 
evening drweth on , and he seeth that it is time to lodge him 
he espieth before him the caste of the rich king fisherman 
he seeth the bridges , broad and long , but they seem not to him the same as they had seemed to messire gawain 
he beholdeth the rich entrance of the gateway there where our lord god was figured as he was set upon the rood , and seeth two lions that guard the entrance of the gate 
lancelot thinketh that sith messire gawain had passed through amidstthe lions , he would do likewise 
he goeth toward the gateway , and the lions that were unchained prick up their ears and look at him 
howbeit lancelot goeth his way between them without heeding them , and neither of them was fain to do him any hurt 
he alighteth before the mastrpalace , and mounteth upward all armed 
two other knights come to meet him and receive him with right great joy , then they make him be seated on a couch in the midstof the hall and be disarmed of two servants 
two damsels bring him a right rich robe and make him be apparelled therewithal 
lancelot beholdeth the richness of the hall and seeth nought figured there save images of saints , men or women , and he seeth the hall hung about with cloths of silk in many places 
the knights lead him before king fisherman in a chamber where he lay right richly 
he findeth the king , that lieth on a bed so rich and so fair apparelled as never was seen a better , and one damsel was at his head and another at his feet 
lancelot saluteth him right nobly , and the king answereth him full fairly as one that is a right worshipful man 
such a brightness of light was there in the chamber as that it seemed the sun were beaming on all sides , and albeit the night was dark , no candles , so far as lancelot might espy , were lighted therewithin 
sir , saith king fisherman , can you tell me tidings of my sistr s son , that was son of alain li gros of the valleys of camelot , whom they call perceval 
sir , saith lancelot , i saw him not long time sithence in the house of king hermit , his uncle 
sir , saith the king , they tell me he is a right good knight 
sir , saith lancelot , he is the bestknight of the world 
i myself have felt the goodness of his knighthood and his valour , for right sorely did he wound me or ever i knew him or he me 
what is your name 
saith the king 
sir , i am called lancelot of the lake , king ban s son of benoic 
ha , saith the king , you are nigh of our lineage , you ought to be good knight of right , and so are you as i have heard witness , lancelot , saith the king 
behold there the chapel where the mostholy graal taketh his rest that appeared to two knights that have been herewithin 
i know not what was the name of the first but never saw i any so gentle and quiet , nor had better likelihood to be good knight 
it was through him that i have fallen into languishment 
the second was messire gawain 
sir , saith lancelot , the firstwas perceval your nephew 
ha 
saith king fisherman , take heed that you speak true 
sir , saith lancelot , i ought to know him well 
ha , god 
saith the king , wherefore then did i know him not 
through him have i fallen into this languishment , and had i only known then that it was he , should i now be all whole of my limbs and of my body , and right instntly do i pray you , when you shall see him , that he come to see me or ever i die , and that he be fain to succour and help his mother , whose men have been slain , and whose land hath been reaved in such sort that never may she have it again save by him alone 
his sistr hath gone in questof him throughout all kingdoms 
sir , saith lancelot , this will i tell him gladly , if ever i may find him in any place , but it is great adventure of finding him , for ofttimes will he change his cognizance in divers fashion and conceal his name in many places 
xii 
king fisherman is right joyous of the tidings he hath heard of his nephew , wherefore he maketh lancelot be honoured greatly 
the knights seat them in the hall at a table of ivory at meat , and the king remaineth in his chamber 
when they had washen , the table was dight of rich sets of vessels of gold and silver , and they were served of rich meats of venison of hart and wild boar 
the stry witnesseth that the graal appeared not at this feast  it held not aloof for that lancelot was not one of the three knights of the world of the mostrenown and mightiestvalour , but for his great sin as touching the queen , whom he loved without repenting him thereof , for of nought did he think so much as of her , nor never might he remove his heart therefrom 
when they had eaten they rose from the tables 
two damsels waited on lancelot at his going to bed , and he lay on a right rich couch , nor were they willing to depart until such time as he was asleep 
he rose on the morrow as soon as he saw the day , and went to hear mass 
he took leave of king fisherman and the knights and damsels , and issued forth of the caste between the two lions , and prayeth god that he allow him to see the queen again betimes , for this is his mostdesire 
he rideth until he hath left the caste far behind and entereth the forest and is in right great desire to see perceval , but the tidings of him were right far away 
he looketh before him in the forestand seeth come right amidstthe launde a knight , and a damsel clad in the richestrobe of gold and silk that ever he had seen tofore 
xiii 
the damsel came weeping by the side of the knight and prayed him oftentimes that he would have mercy upon her 
the knight is stll and holdeth his peace , and saith never a word 
ha , sir , saith the damsel to lancelot , be pleased to beseech this knight on my behalf 
in what manner 
saith lancelot 
sir , saith she , i will tell you 
he hath shown me semblance of love for more than a year , and had me in covenant that he would take me to wife , and i apparelled myself in the richestgarments that i had to come to him 
my father is of greater power and riches than is he , and therefore was not willing to allow the marriage 
wherefore come i with him in this manner , for i love him better than ever another knight beside 
now will he do nought of that he had me in covenant to do , for he loveth another , better , methinketh , than me 
this hath he done , as i surmise , to do shame to my friends and to me 
lancelot seeth the damsel of right great beauty and weeping tenderly , whereof hath he passing great pity 
hold , sir 
saith lancelot to the knight , this shall you not do 
you shall not do such shame to so fair a damsel as that you shall fail to keep covenant with her 
for not a knight is there in the kingdom of logres nor in that of wales but ought to be right well pleased to have so fair a damsel to wife , and i pray and require that you do to the damsel that whereof you held her in covenant 
this will be a right worshipful deed , and i pray and beseech that you do it , and thereof shall i be much beholden unto you 
sir , saith the knight , i have no will thereunto , nor for no man will i do it , for ill would it beseem me 
by my head , then , saith lancelot , the basestknight are you that ever have i seen , nor ought dame nor damsel ever hereafter put trustin you , sith that you are minded to put such disgrace upon this lady 
sir , saith the knight , a worthier lover have i than this , and one that i more value 
wherefore as touching this damsel will i do nought more than i have said 
whither , then , mean you to take her 
saith lancelot 
i mean to take her to a hold of mine own that is in this forest and to give her in charge to a dwarf of mine that looketh after my house , and i will marry her to some knight or some other man 
now never god help me , saith lancelot , but this is foul churlishness you tell me , and , so you do not her will , it shall betide you ill of me myself , and , had you been armed as i am , you should have felt my firstonset already 
ha , saith the damsel to lancelot , be not so ready to do him any hurt , for nought love i so well as i love his body , whatsoever he do unto me 
for god s sake pray him that he do me the honour he hath promised me 
willingly , saith lancelot 
sir knight , will you do this whereof you had the damsel in covenant 
sir , saith the knight , i have told you plainly that i will not 
by my head , saith lancelot , you shall do it , or otherwise sentence of death hath passed upon you , and this not so much for the sake of the damsel only , but for the churlishness that hath taken possession of you , that it be not a reproach to other knights 
for promise that knight maketh to dame or damsel behoveth him to keep 
you , as you tell me , are knight , and no knight ought to do churlishly to his knowledge , and this churlishness is so far greater than another , that for no prayer that the damsel may make will i suffer that it shall be done , but that if you do not that whereof you held her in covenant , i shall slay you , for that i will not have this churlishness made a reproach unto other knights 
he drweth his sword and would have come toward him , when the knight cometh over againsthim and saith to him  slay me not 
tell me rather what you would have me do 
i would , saith he , that you take the damsel to wife without denial 
sir , saith he , it pleaseth me better to take her than to die 
sir , i will do your will 
i thank you much therefor , saith lancelot 
damsel , is this your pleasure also 
yea , sir , but , so please you , take not your departure from us until such time as he shall have done that which you tell him 
i will , well that so it be , saith lancelot , for love of you 
they ride together right through the forest until they came to a chapel at a hermitage , and the hermit wedded them and made much joy thereof 
when it cometh to aftermass , lancelot would fain depart , but the damsel prayeth him right sweetly that he should come right to her father s house to witness that the knight had wedded her 
xiv 
sir , saith she , my father s hold is not far away 
lady , saith lancelot , willingly will i go sith that you beseech me thereof 
they ride so long right amidstthe forest that presently they come to the caste of the vavasour , that was sitting on the bridge of his caste , right sorrowful and troubled because of his daughter 
lancelot is gone on before and alighteth 
the vavasour riseth up to meet him , and lancelot recounteth unto him how his daughter hath been wedded , and that he hath been at the wedding 
thereof the vavasour maketh right great joy 
therewithal , behold you , the knight and the vavasours daughter that are staightway alighted , and the vavasour thanketh lancelot much of the honour he hath done his daughter 
therewith he departeth from the caste and rideth amidstthe forestthe day long , and meeteth a damsel and a dwarf that came a great gallop 
sir , saith the damsel to lancelot , from whence come you 
damsel , saith he , i come from the vavasour s caste that is in this forest did you meet , saith she , a knight and a damsel on your way 
yea , saith lancelot , he hath wedded her 
say you true 
saith she 
i tell you true , saith lancelot , but had i not been there , he would not have wedded her 
shame and ill adventure may you have thereof , for you have reft me of the thing in the world that mosti loved 
know you well of a truth that joy of him shall she never have , and if the knight had been armed as are you , never would he have done your will , but his own 
this is not the firstharm you have done me 
you and messire gawain between you have slain my uncle and my two cousinsgerman in the forest whom behoved me bury in the chapel where you were , there where my dwarf that you see here was making the graves in the burialground 
damsel , saith lancelot , true it is that i was there , but i departed from the graveyard , honour safe 
true , saith the dwarf , for the knights that were there were craven , and failed 
fair friend , saith lancelot , rather would i they should be coward toward me than hardy 
lancelot , saith the damsel , much outrage have you done , for you slew the knight of the wast house , there whither the brachet led messire gawain , but had he there been known , he would not have departed so soon , for he was scarce better loved than you , and god grant you may find a knight that may abate the outrages that are in your heart and in his 
for great rejoicing would there be thereof , for many a good knight have you slain , and i myself will bring about trouble for you , so quickly as i may 
xv 
thereupon the dwarf smiteth the mule with his whip , and she departeth 
lancelot would answer none of her reviling , wherefore he departed forthwith , and rideth so long on his journeys that he is come back to the house of the good king hermit , that maketh right great joy of him 
he telleth him that he hath been unto the house of king fisherman , his brother that lieth in languishment , and telleth him also how he hath been honoured in his hostl , and of the salutations that he sent him 
king hermit is right joyous thereof , and asketh him of his nephew , and he telleth him he hath seen him not since he departed thence 
king hermit asketh him whether he hath seen the graal , and he telleth him he hath seen it not at all 
i know well , saith the king , wherefore this was so 
you had had the like desire to see the graal that you have to see the queen , the graal would you have seen 
sir , saith lancelot , the queen do i desire to see for the sake of her good intent , her wisdom , courtesy and worth , and so ought every knight to do 
for in herself hath she all honourable conditions that a lady may have 
god grant you good issue therein , saith king hermit , and that you do nought whereof he may visit you with his wrath at the day of judgment 
lancelot lay the night in the hermitage , and on the morrow departed thence and took leave when he had heard mass , and cometh back as staight as he may to pannenoisance on the sea of wales , where were the king and queen with great plenty of knights and barons 
branch xi 
title i 
this high histry witnesseth whereof this account cometh , and saith that perceval is in the kingdom of logres , and came great pace toward the land of the queen of the tents to release the damsel of the car , that he had left in hostge on account of clamados , that had put upon him the treason whereof behoved him to defend himself 
or ever he entered into the land of the queen of the tents , he met the damsel of the car that was coming thence 
she made right great joy of him , and told him that clamados was dead of the wound that meliot of logres had dealt him , and that meliot of logres was heal 
sir , saith she , the tents and the awnings are taken down , and the queen hath withdrwn herself to the caste with her maidens , and by my coming back from thence may you well know that you are altogether quit 
wherefore i tell you that your sistr goeth in questof you , and that never had your mother so sore need of help as now she hath , nor never again shall your sistr have joy at heart until such time as she shall have found you 
she goeth seeking for you by all the kingdoms and stange countries in sore misease , nor may she find any to tell her tidings of you 
therewith perceval departeth from the damsel , without saying more , and rideth until he cometh into the kingdom of wales to a caste that is seated above the sea upon a high rock , and it was called the caste of tallages 
he seeth a knight issue from the caste and asketh whose hold it is , and he telleth him that it belonged to the queen of the maidens 
he entereth into the firstbaby of the caste , and alighteth at the mountingstge and setteth down his shield and his spear , and looketh toward the stps whereby one goeth up to the higher hall , and seeth upon them row upon row of knights and damsels 
he cometh thitherward , but never a knight nor dame was there that gave him greeting of any kind 
he saluted them at large 
he went his way right amidstthem toward the door of the great hall , which he findeth shut , and rattled the ring so loud that it made the whole hall resound thereof 
a knight cometh to open it and he entereth in 
sir knight , welcome may you be 
good adventure may you have 
saith perceval 
he lowereth his ventail and taketh off his helm 
the knight leadeth him to the queen s chamber , and she riseth to meet him , and maketh great joy of him , and maketh him sit beside her all armed 
ii 
with that , cometh a damsel and kneeleth before the queen and saith  lady , behold here the knight that was firstat the graal 
i saw him in the court of the queen of the tents , there where he was appeached of treason and murder 
now hast , saith the queen to the knight , let sound the ivory horn upon the caste 
the knights and damsels that were sitting on the stps leapt up , and make right great joy , and the other knights likewise 
they say that now they know well that they have done their penance 
thereupon they enter into the hall , and the lady issueth from her chamber and taketh perceval by the hand and goeth to meet them 
behold here , saith she , the knight through whom you have had the pain and travail , and by whom you are now released therefrom 
ha 
say the knights and dames , welcome may he be 
by my head , saith the queen , so is he , for he is the knight of the world that i had mostdesire to see 
she maketh disarm him , and bring the rich robe of cloth of silk to apparel him 
sir , saith the queen , four knights and three damsels have been under the stps at the entrance of the hall ever since such time as you were at the hostl of king fisherman , there where you forgot to ask whereof the graal might serve , nor never since have they had none other house nor hold wherein to eat nor to drnk nor to lie , nor never since have they had no heart to make joy , nor would not now and you had not come hither 
wherefore ought you not to marvel that they make joy of your coming 
howbeit , on the other hand , sore need have we in this caste of your coming , for a knight warreth upon me that is brother of king fisherman , and his name is the king of caste mortal 
lady , saith he , he is my uncle , albeit i knew it not of a long time , nor of the good king fisherman either , and the good king hermit is my uncle also 
i tell you of a very truth , the king of caste mortal is the mostfell and cruel that liveth , wherefore ought none to love him for the felony that is in him , for he hath begun to war upon king fisherman my uncle , and challengeth him his caste , and would fain have the lance and the graal 
sir , saith the queen , in like sort challengeth he my caste of me for that i am in aid of king fisherman , and every week cometh he to an island that is in this sea , and ofttimes cometh plundering before this caste and hath slain many of my knights and damsels , whereof god grant us vengeance upon him 
she taketh perceval by the hand and leadeth him to the windows of the hall that were nighestthe sea 
sir , saith she , now may you see the island , there , whereunto your uncle cometh in a galley , and in this island sojourneth he until he hath seen where to aim his blow and laid his plans 
here below , see , are my gallies that defend us thereof 
iii 
perceval , as the histry telleth , was much honoured at the caste of the queen of the maidens , that was right passing fair 
the queen loved him of a passing great love , but well she knew that she should never have her desire , nor any dame nor damsel that might set her intent thereon , for chast was he and in chastty was fain to die 
long was he at the caste as that he heard tell his uncle was arrived at the island whither he wont to come 
perceval maketh arm him forthwith and entereth into a galley below the hall , and maketh him be rowed toward his uncle , that much marvelleth when he seeth him coming , for never aforetime durstno knight issue out alone from this caste to meet him , nor to come there where he was , body to body 
had he known that it was perceval , he would not have marvelled 
thereupon the galley taketh the ground and perceval is issued forth 
the queen and the knights and her maidens are come to the windows of the caste to behold the bearing of the nephew and the uncle 
the queen would have sent over some of her knights with him , but perceval would not 
the king of caste mortal was tall and stong and hardy 
he seeth his nephew come all armed , but knoweth him not 
perceval knew him well , and kept his sword drwn and his shield on his arm , and sought out his uncle with right passing wrathfulness , and dealeth him a heavy buffet above upon his helm that he maketh him stop withal 
howbeit , the king spareth him not , but smiteth him so passing stutly that he had his helm all dinted in thereby 
perceval attacketh him again , thinking to stike him above on the head , but the king swerveth aside and the blow falleth on the shield and cleaveth it right down as far as the boss 
the king of caste mortal drweth him backward and hath great shame within himself for that perceval should thus fettle him , for he searcheth him with his sword in every part , and dealeth him great buffets in such sort that , and his habergeon had not been so stong and tough , he would have wounded him in many places 
iv 
the king himself giveth him blows so heavy that the queen and all they that were at the windows marvelled how perceval might abide such buffets 
the king took witting of the shield that perceval bare , and looketh on it of a long space 
knight , saith he , who gave you this shield , and on behalf of whom do you bear such an one 
i bear it on behalf of my father , saith he 
did your father , then , bear a red shield with a white hart 
yea , saith perceval , many a day 
was your father , then , king alain of the valleys of camelot 
my father was he without fail 
no blame ought i to have of him , for a good knight was he and a loyal 
are you the son of yglais my sistr , that was his wife 
yea 
saith perceval 
are you my nephew , saith the king of caste mortal , for she was my sistr 
that misliketh me , saith perceval , for thereof have i neither worship nor honour , for the mostdisloyal are you of all my kindrd , and i knew well when i came hither that it was you , and , for the great disloyalty that is in you , you war upon the bestking that liveth and the mostworshipful man , and upon the lady of this caste for that she aideth him in all that she may 
please god , henceforward she shall have no need to guard her to the bestof her power againstso evil a man as are you , nor shall her caste never be obedient to you , nor the sacred hallows that the good king hath in his keeping 
for god loveth not you so much as he doth him , and so long as you war upon him , you do i defy and hold you as mine enemy 
the king wotteth well that his nephew holdeth him not over dear , and that he is eager to do him a hurt , and that he holdeth his sword in his fistand that he is well roofedin of his helmet , and that he is raging like a lion 
he misdoubteth him sore of his stength and his great hardiment 
he hath well proven and essayed that he is the bestknight of the world 
he durstno longer abide his blows , but rather he turneth him full speed toward his galley , and leapeth thereinto forthwith 
he pusheth out from the shore incontinent , and perceval followeth him right to the beach , full heavy that he hath gotten him away 
he crieth after him  evil king , tell me not that i am of your kindrd 
never yet did knight of my mother s lineage flee from other knight , save you alone 
now have i conquered this island , and never on no day hereafter be you so overhardy as be seen therein again 
the king goeth his way as he that hath no mind to return , and perceval cometh back again in his galley to the queen s caste , and all they of the palace come forth to meet him with great joy 
the queen asketh him how it is with him and whether he is wounded 
lady , saith he , not at all , thank god 
she maketh disarm him , and honoureth him at her pleasure , and commandeth that all be obedient to him , and do his commandment so long as he shall please to be there 
now feel they safer in the caste for that the king hath so meanly departed thence , and it well seemeth them that never will he dare come back for drad of his nephew more than of any other , whereof make they much joy in common 
branch xii 
title i 
now is the stry silent about perceval , and saith that king arthur is at pannenoisance in wales with great plenty of knights 
lancelot and messire gawain are repaired thither , whereof all the folk make great joy 
the king asketh of messire gawain and lancelot whether they have seen lohot his son in none of these islands nor in none of these forest , and they answer him that they have seen him nowhere 
i marvel much , saith the king , what hath become of him , for no tidings have i heard of him beyond these , that kay the seneschal slew logrin the giant , whose head he brought me , whereof i made great joy , and right willingly did i make kay s lands the broader thereof , and well ought i to do him such favour , for he avenged me of him that did my land more hurt than any other , wherefore i love him greatly 
and the king had only known how kay had wrought againsthim , he would not have so highly honoured his chivalry and his hardiment 
the king sate one day at meat and queen guenievre at his side 
thereupon behold you , a damsel that alighteth before the palace , then mounteth the stps of the hall and is come before the king and the queen 
sir , i salute you as the sorestdismayed and mostdiscounselled damsel that ever you have seen 
wherefore am i come to demand a boon of you for the nobleness and valour of your heart 
damsel , saith the king , god counsel you of his will and pleasure , and i myself am full fain to partake therein 
the damsel looketh at the shield that hangeth in the midstof the hall 
sir , saith she , i beseech you that you deign grant me the aid of the knight that shall bear this shield from hence 
for sorer need have i thereof than ever another of them that are discounselled 
damsel , saith the king , full well shall i be pleased , so the knight be also fain to do as you say 
sir , saith she , and he be so good knight as he is reported , never will he refuse your prayer , nor would he mine , if only i were here at such time as he shall come 
for , had i been able to find my brother that i have been seeking this long time , then well should i have been succoured long agone 
i have sought him in many lands , nor never could i learn where he is 
therefore to my sorrow , behoveth me to ride all lonely by the stange islands and put my body in jeopardy of death , whereof ought these knights to have great pity 
ii 
damsel , saith the king , for this reason do i refuse you nought of that you wish , and right willingly will i put myself to trouble herein 
sir , saith she , much thanks to god thereof 
he maketh her be set at meat , and much honour be done her 
when the cloths were drwn , the queen leadeth her into her chamber with the maidens , and maketh much joy of her 
the brachet that was brought thither with the shield was lying on a couch of staw 
he would not know the queen nor her damsels nor the knights that were in the court , but so soon as ever he heard the damsel he cometh to her and maketh greater joy of her than ever was brachet seen to make before 
the queen and her damsels marvelled much thereof , as did the damsel herself to whom the brachet made such joy , for never since that he was brought into the hall had they seen him rejoice of any 
the queen asked her whether she knew him 
certes , lady , no , for never , so far as i know , have i seen him before 
the brachet will not leave her , but will be always on her lap , nor can she move anywhither but he followeth her 
the damsel is long time in the court in this manner , albeit as she that had sore need of succour she remained in the chapel every day after that the queen was come forth , and wept right tenderly before the image of the saviour , and prayed right sweetly that his mother would counsel her , for that she had been left in sore peril of losing her caste 
the queen asked her one day who her brother was 
lady , saith she , one of the bestknights of the world , whereof have i heard witness 
he departed from my father s and mother s hostl a right young squire 
my father is since dead , and my lady mother is left without help and without counsel , wherefore hath a certain man reaved her of her land and her castes and slain her men 
the very caste wherein she hath her hold would he have seized long agone had it not been for messire gawain that made it be safeguarded againsther enemies for a year 
the term is now ended and my lady mother is in drad lestshe shall lose her caste , for none other hold hath she 
wherefore is it that she hath sent me to seek for my brother , for she hath been told that he is a good knight , and for that i may not find him am i come to this court to beseech of king arthur succour of the knight that shall bear away the shield , for i have heard tell that he is the bestknight of the world 
for the bounty that is in him will he therefore have pity on me 
damsel , saith the queen , would that you had found him , for great joy would it be unto me that your mother were succoured , and god grant that he that ought to bear the shield come quickly , and grant him courage that he be fain to succour your mother 
shall he be , please god , for never was good knight that was without pity 
iii 
the queen hath much pity of the damsel , for she was of right great beauty , and well might it be seen by her cheer and her semblant that no joy had she 
she had told the queen her name and the name of her father and mother , and the queen told her that many a time had she heard tell of alain li gros , and that he was said to be a worshipful man and good knight 
the king lay one night beside the queen , and was awoke from his firstsleep so that he might not go to sleep again 
he rose and did on a great grey cape and issueth forth of the chamber and cometh to the windows of the hall that opened toward the sea , calm and untroubled , so that much pleasure had he of looking thereat and leaning at the windows 
when he had been there of a long space , he looked out to sea and saw coming afar off as it were the shining of a candle in the midstof the sea 
much he marvelled what it might be 
he looked at it until he espied what seemed him to be a ship wherein was the light , and he was minded not to move until such time as he should know whether a ship it were or something other 
the longer he looketh at it , the better perceiveth he that it is a ship , and that it was coming with great rushing toward the caste as fastas it might 
the king espieth it nigh at hand , but none seeth he within nor without save one old man , ancient and bald , of right passing seemliness that held the rudder of the ship 
the ship was covered of a right rich cloth in the midstand the sail was lowered , for the sea was calm and quiet 
the ship was arrived under the palace and was quite stll 
when the ship had taken ground , the king looketh thereat with much marvelling , and knoweth not who is there within , for not a soul heareth he speak 
him thinketh that he will go see what is within the ship , and he issueth forth of the hall , and cometh thither where the ship was arrived , but he might not come anigh for the flowing of the sea 
sir , saith he that held the rudder , allow me a little 
he launcheth forth of the ship a little boat , and the king entereth thereinto , and so cometh into the great ship , and findeth a knight that lay all armed upon a table of ivory , and had set his shield at his head 
at the head of his bed had he two tall twistd links of wax in two candlestcks of gold , and the like at his feet , and his hands were crossed upon his breast the king drweth nigh toward him and so looketh at him , and seemed him that never had he seen so comely a knight 
iv 
sir , saith the mastr of the ship , for god s sake drw you back and let the knight rest for thereof hath he sore need 
sir , saith the king , who is the knight 
sir , this would he well tell you were he willing , but of me may you know it not 
will he depart forthwith from hence 
saith the king 
sir , saith the mastr , not before he hath been in this hall , but he hath had sore travail and therefore he taketh rest when the king heard say that he would come into his palace , thereof had he great joy 
he cometh to the queen s chamber and telleth her how the ship is arrived 
the queen riseth and two of her damsels with her , and apparelleth her of a kirtle of cloth of silk , furred of ermine , and cometh into the midstof the hall 
thereupon behold you , the knight that cometh all armed and the mastr of the ship before him bearing the twistd link of wax in the candlestck of gold in front of him , and the knight held his sword all naked 
sir , saith the queen , well may you be welcome 
lady , saith he , god grant you joy and good adventure 
sir , saith she , please god we have nought to fear of you 
lady , saith he , no fear ought you to have 
the king seeth that he beareth the red shield with the white hart whereof he had heard tell 
the brachet that was in the hall heareth the knight 
he cometh racing toward him and leapeth about his legs and maketh great joy of him 
the knight playeth with him , then taketh the shield that hung at the column , and hangeth the other there , and cometh back thereafter toward the door of the hall 
lady , saith the king , pray the knight that he go not so hastly 
sir , saith the knight , no leisure have i to abide , but at some time shall you see me again 
the knights also say as much , and the king and queen are right heavy of his departure , but they durstnot press him beyond his will 
he is entered into the ship , and the brachet with him 
the mastr drweth the boat within , and so they depart and leave the caste behind 
king arthur abideth at pannenoisance , and is right sorrowful of the knight , that he hath gone his way so soon 
the knights arose throughout the caste when the day waxed light , and learnt the tidings of the knight that had borne the shield thence , and were right grieved for that they had not seen him 
the damsel that had asked the boon cometh to the king 
sir , saith she , did you speak of my business to the knight 
damsel , saith the king , never a whit 
to my sorrow , for he hath departed sooner than i would 
sir , saith she , you have done a wrong and a sin , but , please god , so good a king as are you shall not fail of his covenants to damsel so forlorn as am i 
the king was right sorrowful for that he had remembered not the damsel 
she departeth from the court , and taketh leave of the king and queen , and saith that she herself will go seek the knight , and that , so she may find him , she will hold the king quit of his covenant 
messire gawain and lancelot are returned to the court , and have heard the tidings of the knight that hath carried away the shield , and are right grieved that they have not seen him , and messire gawain more than enough , for that he had lien in his mother s house 
lancelot seeth the shield that he had left on the column , and knoweth it well , and saith , now know i well that perceval hath been here , for this shield was he wont to bear , and the like also his father bore 
ha , saith messire gawain , what illchance have i that i may not see the good knight 
messire gawain , saith lancelot , so nigh did i see him that methought he would have killed me , for never before did i essay onset so stut nor so cruel of force of arms , and i myself wounded him , and when he knew me he made right great joy of me 
i was with him at the house of king hermit a long space until that i was healed 
lancelot , saith messire gawain , i would that he had wounded me , so i were not too sore harmed thereof , so that i might have been with him so long time as were you 
lords , saith the king , behoveth you go on questof him or i will go , for i am bound to beseech his aid on behalf of a damsel that asked me thereof , but she told me that , so she might find him first i should be quit of her request sir , saith the queen , you will do a right great service and you may counsel her herein , for sore discounselled is she 
she hath told me that she was daughter of alain li gros of the valleys of camelot , and that her mother s name is yglais , and her own dindrne 
ha , lady , saith messire gawain , she is sistr to the knight that hath borne away the shield , for i lay at her mother s house wherein i was right well lodged 
by my head , saith the queen , it may well be , for so soon as she came in hither 
the brachet that would have acquaintance with none , made her great joy , and when the knight came to seek the shield , the brachet , that had remained in the hall , played gladly with him and went  by my faith , saith messire gawain , i will go in questof the knight , for right great desire have i to see him 
i , saith lancelot , never so glad have i been to see him aforetime as 
should be now 
howsoever it be , saith the king , i pray you so speed my business that the damsel shall not be able to plain her of me 
v 
sir , saith lancelot , we will tell him and we may find him , that his sistr is gone in questof him , and that she hath been at your court 
the two knights depart from the court to enter on the questof the good knight , and leave the caste far behind them and ride in the midstof a high forestuntil they find a cross in the midstof a launde , there where all the roads of the forestjoin together 
lancelot , saith messire gawain , choose which road soever you will , and so let each go by himself , so that we may the sooner hear tidings of the good knight , and let us meet together again at this cross at the end of a year and let either tell other how he hath sped , for please god in one place or another we shall hear tidings of him 
lancelot taketh the way to the right , and messire gawain to the left 
therewithal they depart and commend them one another to god

title i 
here the stry is silent of lancelot , and saith that messire gawain goeth a great pace riding , and prayeth god that he will so counsel him that he may find the knight 
he rideth until the day cometh to decline , and he lay in the house of a hermit in the forest that lodged him well 
sir , saith the hermit to messire gawain , whom do you go seek 
sir , saith he , i am in questof a knight that i would see right gladly 
sir , saith the hermit , in this neighbourhood will you find no knight 
wherefore not 
saith messire gawain , be there no knights in this country 
there was wont to be plenty , saith the hermit , but now no longer are there any , save one all alone in a caste and one all alone on the sea that have chased away and slain all the others 
who is the one of the sea 
saith messire gawain 
sir , saith the hermit , i know not who he is , save only that the sea is hard by here , where the ship runneth oftentimes wherein the knight is , and he repaireth to an island that is under the caste of the queen of the maidens , from whence he chased an uncle of his that warred upon the caste , and the other knights that he had chased thence and slain were helping his uncle , so that now the caste is made sure 
the knights that might flee from this forestand this kingdom durstnot repair thither for the knight , for they drad his hardiment and his great might , sith that they know well they might not long endure againsthim 
sir , saith messire gawain , is it so long a space sithence that he hath haunted the sea 
sir , saith the hermit , it is scarce more than a twelvemonth 
how nigh is this to the sea 
saith messire gawain 
sir , saith the hermit , it is not more than two leagues welsh 
when i have gone forth to my toil , many a time have i seen the ship run close by me , and the knight , all armed , within , and meseemed he was of right great comeliness , and had as passing proud a look as any lion 
i can well tell you never was knight so draded in this kingdom as is he 
the queen of the maidens would have losther caste ere now but for him 
nor never sithence that he hath chased his uncle from the island , hath he entered the queen s caste even once , but from that time forth hath rather rowed about the sea and searched all the islands and sticken down all the proud in such sort that he is draded and warily avoided throughout all the kingdoms 
the queen of the maidens is right sorrowful for that he cometh not to her caste , for so dear she holdeth him of very love , that and he should come and she might keep him so that he should never issue forth again , she would sooner lock him up with her there safe within 
know you 
saith messire gawain , what shield the knight beareth 
sir , saith the hermit , i know not now to blazon it , for nought know i of arms 
three score years and more have i been in this hermitage , yet never saw i this kingdom before so dismayed as is it now 
messire gawain lay the night therewithin , and departed when he had heard mass 
he drweth him as nigh the sea as he may , and rideth along beside the shore and many a time drweth rein to look forth if he might see the knight s ship 
nowhere might he espy it 
he hath ridden until he cometh to the caste of the queen of the maidens 
when she knew that it was messire gawain , she made thereof great joy , and pointed him out the island whither perceval had repaired , and from whence he had drven his uncle 
sir , saith she to messire gawain , i plain me much of him , for never hath he been fain to enter herewithin , save the one time that he did battle with his uncle , but ever sithence hath he made repair to this island and rowed about this sea 
lady , saith messire gawain , and whereabout may he be now 
sir , god help me , saith she , i know not , for i have not seen him now of a long space , and no earthly man may know his intent nor his desire , nor whitherward he may turn 
messire gawain is right sorrowful for that he knoweth not where to seek him albeit he hath so late tidings of him 
he lay at the caste and was greatly honoured , and on the morrow he heard mass and took leave of the queen , and rideth all armed beside the seashore , for that the hermit had told him , and the queen herself , that he goeth oftener by sea than by land 
he entereth into a forestthat was nigh the sea , and seeth a knight coming a great gallop as if one were chasing him to slay him 
sir knight , saith messire gawain , whither away so fast sir , i am fleeing from the knight that hath slain all the others 
who is the knight 
saith messire gawain 
i know not who he is , saith the knight , but and you go forward you are sure to find him 
meseemeth , saith messire gawain , that i have seen you aforetime 
sir , saith he , so have you 
i am the knight coward that you met in the forestthere where you conquered the knight of the shield party black and white , and i am man of the damsel of the car 
wherefore i pray you for god s sake that you do me no hurt , for the knight that i found down yonder hath a look so fierce that i thought i was dead when i saw it 
need you fear nought of me , saith messire gawain , for i love your damsel well 
sir , saith the knight , i would that all the other knights would say as much in respect of me , for no fear have i save for myself alone 
ii 
messire gawain departeth from the knight , and goeth his way amidstthe forestthat overshadowed the land as far as the seashore , and looketh forth from the top of a sandhill , and seeth a knight armed on a tall destier , and he had a shield of gold with a green cross 
ha , god , saith messire gawain , grant that this knight may be able to tell me tidings of him i seek 
thitherward goeth he a great gallop , and saluteth him worshipfully and he him again 
sir , saith messire gawain , can you tell me tidings of a knight that beareth a shield banded of argent and azure with a red cross 
yea , sir , saith the knight , that can i well 
at the assembly of the knights may you find him within forty days 
sir , saith messire gawain , where will the assembly be 
in the red launde , where will be many a good knight 
there shall you find him without fail 
thereof hath messire gawain right great joy , and so departeth from the knight and the knight from him , and goeth back toward the sea a great gallop 
messire gawain saw not the ship whereinto he entered , for that it was anchored underneath the cliff 
the knight entered thereinto and put out to sea as he had wont to do 
howbeit messire gawain goeth his way toward the red launde where the assembly was to be , and desireth much the day that it shall be 
he rideth until he cometh one eventide nigh to a caste that was of right fair seeming 
he met a damsel that was following after a dead knight that two other knights bare upon a horsebier , and she rode a great pace right amidstthe forest  and messire gawain cometh to meet her and saluteth her , and she returned the salute as fairly as she might 
damsel , saith messire gawain , who lieth in this bier 
sir , a knight that a certain man hath slain by great outrage 
whither shall you ride this day 
sir , i would fain be in the red launde , and thither will i take this knight , that was a right worshipful man for his age 
wherefore will you take him there 
saith messire gawain 
for that he that shall do bestat the assembly of knights shall avenge this knight s death 
iii 
the damsel goeth her way thereupon 
messire gawain goeth to the caste that he had seen , and found none within save only one solitary knight , old and feeble , and a squire that waited upon him 
howbeit , messire gawain alighteth at the caste 
the vavasour lodged him well and willingly , and made his door be well shut fastand messire gawain be disarmed , and that night he showed him honour as well as he might 
when it came to the morrow and messire gawain was minded to depart thence , the vavasour saith to him , sir you may not depart thus , for this door hath not been opened this long while save only yestrday , when i made it be opened before you , to the intent that you should meet on my behalf a certain knight that is fain to slay me , for that the king of caste mortal hath had his hold herewithin , he that warreth on the queen of the maidens 
wherefore i pray you that you help me to defend it againstthe knight 
what shield beareth he 
saith messire gawain 
he beareth a golden shield with a green cross 
what sort of knight is he 
saith messire gawain 
sir , saith the vavasour , a good knight and a hardy and a sure 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , and you can tell me tidings of another knight whereof i am in quest i will protect you againstthis one to the besti may , and if he will do nought for my prayer , i will safeguard you of my force 
what knight , then , do you seek 
saith the vavasour 
sir , a knight that is called perceval , and he hath carried away from the court of king arthur a shield banded argent and azure with a red cross on a band of gold 
he will be at the assembly in the red launde 
these tidings had i of the knight you drad so much 
iv 
thereupon , whilstmessire gawain was thus speaking to the vavasour , behold you the knight of the golden shield , that drweth rein in the midstof a launde that was betwixt the caste and the forest  the vavasour seeth him from the windows of the hall , and pointeth him out to messire gawain 
messire gawain goeth and mounteth on his destier , his shield at his neck and his spear in his fist all armed , and issueth forth of the door when it had been unfastned , and cometh toward the knight , that awaited him on his horse 
he seeth messire gawain coming , but moveth not , and messire gawain marvelleth much that the knight cometh not toward him , for him thinketh well that the vavasour had told him true 
he had not , for never had the knight come thither to do the vavasour any hurt , but on account of the knights that passed by that way that went to seek adventure , for right glad was he to see them albeit he was not minded to make himself known unto any 
messire gawain looketh before him and behind him and seeth that the door was made fastand the bridge drwn up so soon as he was departed thence , whereof he marvelled much and saith to the knight , sir , is your intent nought but good only 
by my head , saith he , nought at all , and readily will i tell it you 
thereupon , behold you a damsel that cometh a great pace , and held a whip wherewith she hurrieth her mule onward , and she drweth rein there where the two knights were 
ha , god 
saith she , shall i ever find one to wreak me vengeance of the traitor vavasour that dwelleth in this caste 
is he then traitor 
saith messire gawain 
yea , sir , the mosttraitor you saw ever 
he lodged my brother the day before yestrday , and bore him on hand at night that a certain knight was warring upon him for that the way whereby the knights pass is here in front of this place , and lied to him so much as that my brother held him in covenant that he would assault a certain knight that he should point out to him , for love of him 
this knight came passing hereby , that had no thought to do hurt neither to the vavasour nor to my brother 
the knight was right stong and hardy , and was born at the caste of escavalon 
my brother issued forth of the caste filled with foolhardiness for the leasing of the vavasour , and ran upon the knight without a word 
the knight could do no less than avenge himself 
they hurtled together so sore that their horses fell under them and their spears passed either through other s heart 
thus were both twain killed on this very piece of ground 
v 
the vavasour took the arms and the horses and put them in safe keeping in his caste , and the bodies of the knights he left to the wild beast , that would have devoured them had i not chanced to come thither with two knights that helped me bury them by yonder cross at the entrance of the forest by my head , saith messire gawain , in like manner would he have wrought me mischief had i been minded to trusthim 
for he bore me in hand that this knight was warring upon him , and besought me that i should safeguard him againsthim 
our lord god so helped me that i intermeddled not therein , for lightly might i have wrought folly 
by the name of god , saith the other , meseemeth it clear that the vavasour would fain that knights should kill each other 
sir , saith the damsel , you say true 
it is of his covetise of harness and horses that he entreateth the knights on thiswise 
damsel , saith messire gawain , whither go you 
sir , saith she , after a knight that i have made be carried in a litter for the dead 
i saw him , saith he , pass by here lastnight , full late lastnight 
the knight taketh leave of messire gawain , and messire gawain saith that he holdeth himself a churl in that he hath not asked him of his name 
the knight said , fair sir , i pray you of love that you ask not my name until such time as i shall ask you of yours 
vi 
messire gawain would ask nought further of the knight , and the knight entered into the lonely forestand messire gawain goeth on his way 
he meeteth neither knight nor damsel to whom he telleth not whom he goeth to seek , and they all say that he will be in the red launde 
he lodged the night with a hermit 
at night , the hermit asked messire gawain whence he came 
sir , from the land of the queen of the maidens 
have you seen perceval , the good knight that took the shield in king arthur s court and left another there 
no , certes , saith messire gawain , whereof am i right sorrowful 
a knight with a shield of gold and a green cross thereon told me that he would be at the red launde 
sir , saith the hermit , you say true , for it was he himself to whom you spake 
tonight is the third night since he lay within yonder , and see here the bracket he brought from king arthur s court , which he hath commanded me to convey to his uncle , king hermit 
alas 
saith messire gawain , what ill chance is mine if this be true 
sir , saith the hermit , i ought not to lie , neither to you nor other 
by the brachet may you well know that this is true 
sir , saith messire gawain , of custm beareth he no such shield 
i know well , saith the hermit , what shield he ought to bear , and what shield he will bear hereafter 
this doth he that he may not be known , and this shield took he in the hermitage of joseus , the son of king hermit , there where lancelot was lodged , where he hanged the four thieves that would have broken into the hermitage by night 
within there hath remained the shield he brought from king arthur s court , with joseus the son of my sistr , and they are as brother and sistr between the twain , and you may know of very truth that albeit joseus be hermit , no knight is there in great britain of his heart and hardiment 
vii 
certes , saith messire gawain , it was sore mischance for me that i should see him yestrday before the caste where the knights pass by , and speak to him and ask him his name , but he besought me that i should not ask him his name until such time as he should ask me mine 
with that he departed from me and entered into the forest and i came hitherward 
now am i so sorrowful that i know not what i may do for the best for king arthur sendeth me in questof him , and lancelot hath also gone to seek him in another part of the kingdom of logres 
now hath too great mischance befallen me of this quest for twice have i seen him and found him and spoken to him , and now have i losthim again 
sir , saith the hermit , he is so close and wary a knight , that he is fain never to wast a word , neither will he make false semblant to any nor speak word that he would not should be heard , nor do shame of his body to his knowledge , nor carnal sin , for virgin and chast is he and doth never outrage to any 
i know well , saith messire gawain , that all the valours and all the cleannesses that ought to be in a knight are in him , and therefore am i the more sorrowful that i am not of them that he knoweth , for a man is worth the more that hath acquaintance with a good knight 
viii 
messire gawain lay the night in the hermit s house , right sorrowful , and in the morning departed when he had heard mass 
josephus the good clerk witnesseth us in this high histry that this hermit had to name josuias , and was a knight of great worship and valour , but he renounced all for the love of god , and was fain to set his body in banishment for him 
all these adventures that you hear in this high record came to pass , josephus telleth us , for the setting forward the law of the saviour 
all of them could he not record , but only these whereof he bestremembered him , and whereof he knew for certain all the adventures by virtue of the holy spirit 
this high record saith that messire gawain hath wandered so far that he is come into the red launde whereas the assembly of knights should be held 
he looketh and seeth the tents pitched and the knights coming from all quarters 
the mostpart were already armed within and before their tents 
messire gawain looketh everywhere , thinking to see the knight he seeketh , but seemeth him he seeth him not , for no such shield seeth he as he beareth 
all abashed is he thereof , for he hath seen all the tents and looked at all the arms 
the knight is not easy to recognise , for he hath changed his arms , and nigh enough is he to messire gawain , albeit you may well understnd that he knoweth it not 
the tournament assembleth from all parts , and the divers fellowships come the one againstother , and the melly of either upon other as they come together waxeth sore and marvellous 
messire gawain searcheth the ranks to find the knight , albeit when he meeteth knight in his way he cannot choose but do whatsoever a knight may do of arms , and yet more would he have done but for his fainness to seek out the knight 
the damsel is at the head of the tournament , for that she would fain know the one that shall have the mastry and the prize therein 
the knight that messire gawain seeketh is not at the head of the fellowships , but in the thickestof the press , and such feats of arms doth he that more may no knight do , and smiteth down the knights about him , that flee from him even as the deerhound fleeth from the lion 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , sith that they have lied to me about the knight , i will seek him no more this day , but forget my discontent as besti may until evening 
he seeth the knight , but knoweth him not , for he had a white shield and cognisances of the same 
messire gawain cometh to him as fastas his horse may carry him , and the knight toward messire gawain 
passing stutly they come together that they pierce their shields below the boss 
their spears were so tough that they break not , and they drw them forth and come together again so stongly that the spears wherewith they smote each other amidstthe breastwere bended so that they unriveted the holdfast of their shields , and they losttheir strrups , and the reins fly from their fist , and they stgger againstthe back saddlebows , and the horses stmbled so as that they all but fell 
they staighten them in saddle and strrup , and catch hold upon their reins , and then come together again , burning with wrath and fury like lions , and either smiteth on other with their spears that may endure no longer , for the shafts are all tofrushed as far as the fist in such sort that they that look on marvel them much how it came to pass that the points had not pierced their bodies 
god would not that the good knights should slay each other , rather would he that the one should know the true worth of the other 
the habergeons safeguarded not their bodies , but the might of god in whom they believed , for in them had they all the valour that knight should have 
never did messire gawain depart from hostl wherein he had lien , but he firstheard mass before he went if so he might , nor never found he dame nor damsel discounselled whereof he had not pity , nor did he ever churlishness to other knight , nor said nor thought it , and he came , as you have heard , of the mostholy lineage of josephus and the good king fisherman 
ix 
the good knights were in the midstof the assembly , and right wrathful was the one againstthe other , and they held their swords naked and their shields on their arms and dealt each other huge buffets right in the midstof the helms 
the mostpart of the knights come to them and tell them that the assembly waiteth for them to come thereunto 
they have much pains to part them asunder , and then the melly beginneth again on all sides , and the evening cometh on that parteth them at last  and on this wise the assembly lastd for two days 
the damsel that brought the knight on a bier in a coffin , dead , prayed the assembly of all the knights to declare which one of all the knights had done the best for the knight that she made be carried might not be buried until such time as he were avenged 
they say that the knight of the white shield and the other with the shield sinople and the golden eagle had done better than all the other , but , for that the knight of the white shield had joined in the melly before the other , they therefore would give him the prize 
they judged that for the time that messire gawain had joined therein he had not done worse than the other knight 
the damsel seeketh the knight of the white shield among the knights and throughout all the tents , but cannot find him , for already hath he departed 
she cometh to messire gawain and saith  sir , sith that i find not the knight of the white shield , you are he that behoveth avenge the knight that lieth dead in the litter 
damsel , saith messire gawain , do me not this shame , for it hath been declared that the other knight hath better done herein than i 
x 
damsel , well you know that no honour should i have thereof , were i to emprise to do that whereof you beseech me , ~for you have said that behoveth none to avenge him , save only that hath borne him bestat this assembly , and that is he of the white shield , and , so god help me , this have i well felt and proven 
xi 
the damsel well understndeth that messire gawain speaketh reason 
ha , sir , saith she , he hath already departed hence and gone into the forest and the mostdiversseeming knight is he and the bestthat liveth , and great pains shall i have or ever i find him again 
the best saith messire gawain 
how know you that 
i know it well , saith she , for that in the house of king fisherman did the graal appear unto him for the goodness of his knighthood and the goodness of his heart and for the chastty of his body 
he forgat to ask that one should serve thereof , whence hath sore harm befallen the land 
he came to the court of king arthur , where he took a shield that none ought to bear save he alone 
up to this time have i well known his coming and going , but nought shall i know thereof hereafter for that he hath changed the cognisance of his shield and arms 
now am i entered into sore pain and travail to seek him , for i shall not have found him of a long space , and i came not to this assembly save for him alone 
damsel , saith messire gawain , you have told me tidings such as no gladness have i thereof , for i also am seeking him , but i know not how i may ever recognise him , for he willeth not to tell me his name , and too often changeth he his shield , and well i know that so i shall ever come in place where he hath changed his cognisance , and he shall come againstme and i againsthim , i shall only know him by the buffets that he knoweth how to deal , for never in arms have i made acquaintance with so cruel a knight 
again would i suffer sorer blows than i have suffered yet , so only i might be where he is 
sir , saith the damsel , what is your name 
damsel , saith he , i am called gawain 
with that he commendeth the damsel to god , and goeth his way in one direction and the damsel in another , and saith to herself that perceval is the mostmarvellous knight of the world , that so often he discogniseth himself 
for when one seeth him one may recognise him not 
messire gawain rideth amidstthe forest and prayeth the saviour lead him into such place as that he may find perceval openly , in such sort that he may have his acquaintance and his love that so greatly he desireth 
branch xiv 
title i 
herewithal the stry is silent of messire gawain , and saith that lancelot seeketh perceval in like manner as did messire gawain , and rideth until that he cometh to the hermitage where he hanged the thieves 
joseus made right great joy of him 
he asked him whether he knew any tidings of the son of the widow lady 
i have seen him sithence that he came from king arthur s court but once only , and whither he is gone i know not 
sir , saith lancelot , i would see him right fain 
king arthur sendeth for him by me 
sir , saith the hermit , i know not when i may see him again , for when once he departeth hence he is not easy to find 
lancelot entereth the chapel with the hermit , and seeth the shield that perceval brought from king arthur s court beside the altar 
sir , saith lancelot , i see his shield yonder 
hide him not from me 
i will not do so , saith the hermit 
this shield , truly , is his , but he took with him another from hence , of gold with a green cross 
know you no tidings of messire gawain 
i have not seen messire gawain sithence tofore i entered into this hermitage 
you have fallen into sore hatred on account of the four robbers that were knights whom you hanged 
for their kinsmen are searching for you in this forestand in other , and are thieves like as were the others , and they have their hold in this forest wherein they bestw their robberies and plunder 
wherefore i pray you greatly be on your guard againstthem 
will i , saith lancelot , please god 
he lay the night in the hermitage , and departeth on the morrow after that he hath heard mass and prayeth god grant he may find perceval or messire gawain 
he goeth his way amidstthe stange forest until that he cometh to a stong caste that was builded right seemly 
he looketh before him and seeth a knight that was issued thereout , and was riding a great pace on a stong destier , and carded a bird on his fisttoward the forest ii 
when he saw lancelot coming he drw up 
sir , saith he , be welcome 
good adventure to you , saith lancelot 
what caste is this 
sir , it is the caste of the golden circlet 
i go to meet the knights and dames that come to the caste , for this day is the day ordained for the adoration of the golden circlet 
what is the golden circlet 
saith lancelot 
sir , it is the crown of thorns , saith the knight , that the saviour of the world had on his head when he was set upon the rood 
wherefore the queen of this caste hath set it in gold and precious stnes in such sort that the knights and dames of this kingdom come to behold it once in the year 
it is said that the knight that was firstat the graal shall conquer it , and therefore is no stange knight allowed to enter 
so please you , i will lead you to mine own hold that is in this forest right great thanks , saith lancelot , but as yet it is not time to take lodging 
he taketh leave of the knight , and so departeth and looketh at the caste , and saith that in right great worship should the knight be held that by the valour of his chivalry shall conquer so noble a hallow as is the golden circlet when it is kept safe in a place so stong 
he goeth his way right amidstthe forest and looketh forth before him and seeth coming the damsel that hath the knight carried in the litter for the dead 
damsel , saith lancelot , be welcome 
sir , god give you good adventure 
sir , saith the damsel , greatly ought i to hate the knight that slew this knight , for that he hath forced me thus to lead him in this wise by fell and forest  so also ought i to mislike me much of the knight that it stndeth upon to avenge him , whom i may not find 
damsel , saith lancelot , who slew this knight 
sir , saith she , the lord of the burning drgon 
who ought of right to avenge him 
sir , saith she , the knight that was in the red launde at the assembly , that joustd with messire gawain , and had the prize of the tournament 
did he better than messire gawain 
saith lancelot 
sir , so did they adjudge him 
for that he was a longer time in the assembly 
a good knight was he , then , saith lancelot , sith that he did better than messire gawain 
by my head , saith the damsel , you say true , for he is the bestknight of the world 
what shield beareth he 
saith lancelot 
sir , saith the damsel , at the assembly he bore white arms , but before that , he had arms of another semblance , and one shield that he had was green , and one gold with a green cross 
damsel , saith he , did messire gawain know him 
sir , not at all , whereof is he right sorrowful 
is he , then , saith he , perceval , the son of the widow lady 
by my head , you say true 
ha , god 
saith lancelot , the more am i mazed how messire gawain knew him not 
damsel , saith he , and know you whitherward they are gone 
sir , saith she , i know not whither , nor have i any tidings , neither or the one nor the other 
he departeth from the damsel and rideth until the sun was set 
he found the rocks darkling and the forestright deep and perilous of seeming 
he rode on , troubled in thought , and weary and full of vexation 
many a time looketh he to right and to left , and he may see any place where he may lodge 
a dwarf espied him , but lancelot saw him not 
the dwarf goeth right along a byway that is in the forest and goeth to a little hold of robberknights that lay out of the way , where was a damsel that kept watch over the hold 
the robbers had another hold where was the damsel where the passing knights are deceived and entrapped 
the dwarf cometh forthright to the damsel , and saith  now shall we see what you will do , for see , here cometh the knight that hanged your uncle grid your three cousins german 
now shall i have the bestof him , saith she , as for mine own share in this matter , but take heed that you be garnished ready to boot 
by my head , saith the dwarf , that will i , for , please god , he shall not escape us again , save he be dead 
the damsel was of passing great beauty and was clad right seemingly , but right treacherous was she of heart , nor no marvel was it thereof , for she came of the lineage of robbers and was nurtured on theft and robbery , and she herself had helped to murder many a knight 
she is come upon the way , so that lancelot hath to pass her , without her kerchief 
she meeteth lancelot and saluteth him and maketh him right great joy , of semblant 
sir , saith she , follow this path that goeth into the forest and you will find a hold that my forefathers stblished for harbouring of such knights as might be passing through the forest  the night is dark already , and if you pass on further no hold will you find nearer than a score leagues welsh 
damsel , saith lancelot , gramercy heartily of this that it pleaseth you to say , for right gladly will i harbour me here , for it is more than time to take lodging , and with you more willingly than another 
iii 
on this wise they go their way talking , as far as the hold 
there was none therewithin save only the dwarf , for the five robber knights were in their hold at the lower end of the forest the dwarf took lancelot s horse , and stbled him , then went up into the hall above , and gave himself up wholly to serving him 
sir , saith the damsel , allow yourself to be disarmed , and have full assurance of safety 
damsel , saith he , small trouble is it for me to wear mine arms , and lightly may i abide it 
sir , saith she , please god , you shall nor lie armed within yonder 
never yet did knight so that harboured therein 
the more the damsel presseth him to disarm , the more it misliketh him , for the place seemeth him right dark and foulseeming , wherefore will he not disarm nor disgarnish himself 
sir , saith she , meseemeth you are suspicious of something , but no call have you to misdoubt of aught here within , for the place is quite safe 
i know not whether you have enemies 
damsel , saith lancelot , never yet knew i knight that was loved of everybody , yet sometimes might none tell the reason thereof 
iv 
lancelot , so saith the stry , would not disarm him , wherefore he made the table be set , and sate thereat beside the damsel at meat 
he made his shield and his helmet and spear be brought into the hall 
he leant back upon a rich couch that was therewithin , with his sword by his side , all armed 
he was weary and the bed was soft , so he went to sleep 
howbeit , the dwarf mounteth on his horse that he had left stll saddled , and goeth his way to the other hold where the robbers were , all five , that were lancelot s mortal enemies 
the damsel remained all alone with him that she hated of a right deadly hate 
she thought to herself that gladly would she slay him , and that , so she might compass it , she would be thereof held in greater worship of all the world , for well she knew that he was a good knight , and that one so good she had never slain 
she filched away the sword that was at his side , then drw it from the scabbard , then looketh to see where she may lightliestsmite him to slay him 
she seeth that his head is so covered of armour that nought appeareth thereof save only the face , and she bethinketh her that one stoke nor two on the helmet would scarce hurt him greatly , but that and she might lift the skirt of his habergeon without awakening him she might well slay him , for so might she thrustthe sword right through his heart 
meanwhile , as she was searching thus , lancelot , that was sleeping and took no heed thereof , saw , so it seemed him , a little curdog come therewithin , and brought with him sundr great mongrel bandogs that ran upon him on all sides , and the little cur bit at him likewise among the others 
the bandogs held him so fastthat he might not get away from them 
he seeth that a greyhound bitch had hold of his sword , and she had hands like a woman , and was fain to slay him 
it seemed him that he snatched the sword from her and slew the greyhound bitch and the biggestand mostmastrful of the bandogs and the little cur 
he was scared of the dram and strted up and awoke , and felt the scabbard of his sword by his side , that the damsel had left there all empty , the which he perceived not , and soon thereafter he fell on sleep again 
the dwarf that had stlen his horse cometh to the robber knights , and crieth to them , up , sirs , and hast you to come and avenge you of your mortal enemy that sent the bestof your kindrd out of the world with such shame 
see , here is his horse that i bring you for a token 
he alighteth of the horse , and giveth him up to them 
right joyous are the robbers of the tidings he telleth them 
the dwarf bringeth them all armed to the hold 
v 
lancelot was awake , all scared of the dram he had dramed 
he seeth them enter within all armed , and the damsel crieth to them  now will it appear , saith she , what you will do 
lancelot hath leapt up , thinking to take his sword , but findeth the scabbard all empty 
the damsel that held the sword was the firstof all to run upon him , and the five knights and the dwarf set upon him from every side 
he perceived that it was his own sword the damsel held , the one he prized above all other 
he taketh his lance that was at his bed s head and cometh toward the mastr of the knights at a great sweep , and smiteth him so fiercely that he thrustth him right through the body so that the lance passeth a fathom beyond , and beareth him to the ground dead 
his spear broke as he drw it back 
he runneth to the damsel that held the sword , and wrestth it forth of her hands and holdeth it fastwith his arm right againsthis flank and grippeth it to him right stait 
albeit she would fain snatch it again from him by force , whereat lancelot much marvelled 
he swingeth it above him , and the four knights come back upon him 
he thinketh to smite one with the sword , when the damsel leapeth in between them , thinking to hold lancelot fast and thereby the blow that should have fallen on one of the knights caught the damsel right through the head and slew her , whereof he was right sorrowful , howsoever she might have wrought againsthim 
vi 
when the four knights saw the damsel dead , right grieved were they thereof 
the dwarf crieth out to them  lords , now shall it be seen how you will avenge the sore mischief done you 
help me god , great shame may you have and you cannot conquer a single knight 
they run upon him again on all sides , but maugre all their heads he goeth thither where he thinketh to find his horse 
him findeth he not 
thereby well knoweth he that the dwarf hath made away with him , wherefore he redoubled his hardiment and his wrath waxed more and more 
the knights were not to be lightly apaid when they saw their lord dead and the damsel that was their cousin 
re buffets they dealt him of their swords the while he defended himself as besthe might 
he caught the dwarf that was edging them on to do him hurt , and clave him as far as the shoulders , and wounded two of the knights right badly , and he himself was hurt in two places 
he might not depart from the house , nor was his horse there within , nor was there but a single entrance into the hall 
the knights set themselves without the door and guard the issue , and lancelot was within with them that were dead 
he sate himself down at the top of the hall to resthim , for he was sore spent with the blows he had given and received 
when he had restd himself awhile , he riseth to his feet and seeth that they have sate them down in the entrance to the hall 
he mounteth up to the windows and flingeth them down them that were dead within through the windows 
justthen the day appeared , fair and clear , and the birds began to sing amidstthe forest whereof the hall was overshadowed 
he maketh fastthe door of the hall and barreth it and shutteth the knights without 
they say one to the other and swear it , that they will not depart thence until they have taken him or famished him to death 
little had lancelot recked of their threats and he might have had his horse at will , but he was not so sure of his stoke afoot as  orseback , as no knight never is 
him thinketh he may well abide the siege as long as god shall please , for the hall was well garnished of meat in right great joints 
he is there within all alone , and the four knights without that keep watch that he goeth not , but neither wish nor will hath he to go forth afoot 
and he had had his horse , the great hardiment that he hath in him would have made that he should go forth honourably , howsoever they without might have taken it and what grievance soever they might have had thereof 
branch xv 
title i 
here the stry is silent of lancelot , and talketh of messire gawain that goeth to seek perceval , and is right heavy for that twice hath he found him when he knew him not 
he cometh back again to the cross whereas he told lancelot he would await him so he should come thither before him 
he went and came to and fro by the forestmore than eight days to wait for him , but could hear no tidings 
he would not return to king arthur s court , for had he gone thither in such case , he would have had blame thereof 
he goeth back upon the questand saith that he will never stnt therein until he shall have found both lancelot and perceval 
he cometh to the hermitage of joseus , and alighted of his horse and found the young hermit joseus , that received him well and made full great joy of him 
he harboured the night therewithin 
messire gawain asked him tidings of perceval , and the hermit telleth him he hath not seen him since before the assembly of the red launde 
can you tell me where i may find him 
saith messire gawain 
not i , saith the hermit , i cannot tell you whereabout he is 
while they were talking on this wise , staightway behold you a knight coming that hath arms of azure , and alighteth at the hermitage to lodge there 
the hermit receiveth him right gladly 
messire gawain asketh him if he saw a knight with white arms ride amidstthe forest by my faith , saith the knight , i have seen him this day and spoken with him , and he asked me and i could tell him tidings of a knight that beareth a shield of sinople with a golden eagle , and i told him , no 
afterward , i enquired wherefore he asked it , and he made answer that he had joustd at him in the red launde , nor never before had he found so strdy assault of any knight , wherefore he was right sorrowful for that he was not acquainted with him , for the sake of his good knighthood 
by my faith , saith gawain , the knight is more sorrowful than he , for nought is there in the world he would gladlier see than him 
the knight espieth messire gawain s shield and saith , ha , sir , methinketh you are he 
certes , saith messire gawain , you say true 
i am he againstwhom he joustd , and right glad am i that so good a knight smote upon my shield , and right sorrowful for that i knew him not 
tell me where i may find him 
ii 
sir , saith joseus the hermit , he will not have gone forth from this forest for this is the place wherein he wonneth mostwillingly , and the shield that he brought from king arthur s court is in this chapel 
he showeth the shield to messire gawain that maketh great joy thereof 
ha , sir , saith the knight of the white arms , is your name messire gawain 
fair sir , saith he , gawain am i called 
sir , saith the knight , i have not ceased to seek you for a long while past  meliot of logres , that is your man , the son of the lady that was slain on your account , sendeth you word that nabigant of the rock hath slain his father on your account 
wherefore he challengeth the land that hath fallen to him 
hereof he prayeth you that you will come to succour him as behoveth lord to do to his liege man 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , behoveth me not fail him therein , wherefore tell him i will succour him so soon as i may 
tell him i have emprised a business that i cannot leave but with loss of honour until such time as it be achieved 
they lay the night at the hermitage until after mass was sung on the morrow 
iii 
the knight departed and messire gawain remained 
when he was apparelled to mount , he looketh before him at the issue of the foresttoward the hermitage , and seeth coming a knight on a tall horse , full speed and all armed , and he bore a shield like the one he saw perceval bearing the firsttime 
sir , saith he , know you this knight that cometh there 
truly , sir , well do i know him 
this is perceval whom you seek , whom you so much desire to see 
god be praised thereof 
saith messire gawain , inasmuch as he cometh hither 
he goeth afoot to meet him , and perceval alighteth so soon as he seeth him 
sir , saith messire gawain , right welcome may you be 
good joy may you have , saith perceval 
sir , saith the hermit , make great joy of him 
this is messire gawain , king arthur s nephew 
thereof do i love him the better 
saith he 
honour and joy ought all they to do him that know him 
he throweth his arms on his neck , and so maketh him great joy 
sir , saith he , can you tell me tidings of a knight that was in the red launde at the assembly of knights 
what shield beareth he 
saith messire gawain 
a red shield with a golden eagle , saith perceval 
more by token , never made i acquaintance with any so strdy in battle as are he and lancelot 
fair sir , it pleaseth you to say so , saith messire gawain 
in the red launde was i at the assembly , and such arms bore i as these you blazon , and i joustd againsta knight in white arms , of whom i know this , that all of knighthood that may be lodged in the body of a man is in him 
sir , saith perceval to messire gawain , you know not how to blame any man 
they hold one another by the hands , and go into the hermitage 
sir , saith messire gawain , when you were in the court of king arthur for the shield that is within yonder , your sistr was also there , and prayed and besought the help of the knight that should bear away the shield , as being the mostdiscounselled damsel in the world 
the king granted it her , and you bore away the shield 
she asked your aid of the king as she that deemed not you were her brother , and said that if the king failed of his covenant , he would do great sin , whereof would he have much blame 
the king was fain to do all he might to seek you , to make good that he had said , and sent us forth in questof you , so that the questlieth between me and lancelot 
he himself would have come had we been unwilling to go 
sir , i have found you three times without knowing you , albeit great desire had i to see you 
this is the fourth time and i know you now , whereof i make myself right joyous 
much am i beholden to you of the fair lodging your mother gave me at camelot 
right sore pity have i of her , for a right worshipful woman is she , and a widow lady and ancient , and fallen into much war without aid nor comfort , through the evil folk that harass her and reave her of her castes 
she prayed me , weeping the while right sweetly , that and if i should find you that are her son , i should tell you of her plight , that your father is dead , and that she hath no succour nor aid to look for save from you alone , and if you succour her not shortly , she will lose her own one caste that she holdeth , and mustneeds become a beggar , for of the fifteen castes she wont to have in your father s time , she hath now only that of camelot , nor of all her knights hath she but five to guard the caste 
wherefore i pray you on her behalf and for your own honour , that you will grant her herein of your counsel and your valour and your might , for of no chivalry that you may do may you rise to greater worship 
so sore need hath she herein as you hear me tell , nor would i that she should lose aught by default of message , for thereof should i have sin and she harm , and you yourself also , that have the power to amend it and ought of right so to do 
well have you delivered yourself herein , saith perceval , and betimes will i succour her and our lord god will 
you will do honour to yourself , saith messire gawain 
thereof will you have praise with god and worship with the world 
well know i , saith perceval , that in me ought she to have aid and counsel as of right , and that so i do not accordingly , i ought to have reproach and be blamed as recreant before the world 
iv 
in god s name , saith the hermit , you speak according to the scripture , for he that honoureth not his father and mother neither believeth in god nor loveth him 
all this know i well , saith perceval , and well pleased am i to be reminded thereof , and well know i also mine intent herein , albeit i tell it to none 
if any can tell me tidings of lancelot , right willingly shall i hear them , and take it kindly of the teller thereof 
sir , saith joseus , it is but justnow since he lay here within , and asked me tidings of messire gawain , and i told him such as i knew 
another time before that , he lay here when the robbers assailed us that he hanged in the forest and so hated is he thereof of their kinsfolk that and they may meet him , so they have the might , he is like to pay for it right dear , and in this forestwon they rather than in any other 
i told him as much , but he made light thereof in semblant , even as he will in deed also if their force be not too great 
by my head , saith perceval , i will not depart forth of this forestuntil i know tidings of him , if messire gawain will pledge himself thereto 
messire saith he desireth nothing better , sith that he hath found perceval , for he may not be at ease until such time as he shall know tidings of lancelot , for he hath great misgiving sith that he hath enemies in the forest v 
perceval and messire gawain sojourned that day in the forestin the hermitage , and the morrow perceval took his shield that he brought from king arthur s court , and left that which he brought with him , and messire gawain along with him that made himself right joyous of his company 
they ride amidstthe forestboth twain , all armed , and at the right hour of noon they meet a knight that was coming a great gallop as though he were all scared 
perceval asketh him whence he cometh , that he seemeth so adrad 
sir , i come from the forestof the robbers that won in this forestwherethrough you have to pass 
they have chased me a full league welsh to slay me , but they would not follow me further for a knight that they have beset in one of their holds , that hath done them right sore mischief , for he hath hanged four of their knights and slain one , as well as the fairestdamsel that was in the kingdom 
right well had she deserved the death for that she harboured knights with fair semblant and showed them much honour , and afterward brought about their death and destuction , between herself and a dwarf that she hath , that slew the knights 
know you who is the knight 
saith perceval 
sir , saith the knight , not i , for no leisure had i to ask him , for sorer need had i to flee than to sty 
i tell you that on account of the meat that failed him in the hold wherein they beset him , he issued forth raging like a lion , nor would he have suffered himself be shut up so long but for two wounds that he had upon his body 
for he cared not to issue forth of the house until such time as they were healed , and also for that he had no horse 
so soon as he felt himself whole , he ventured himself againstthe four knights , that were so adrad of him that they durstnot come anigh 
moreover he deigneth not to go afoot , wherefore if they now come anigh , it may not be but he shall have one at leastout of their four horses , but they hold them heedfully aloof 
sir , saith perceval ,gramercy of these tidings 
they were fain to depart from the knight , but said he  ha , lords , allow me so much as to see the destuction of this evil folk that have wrought such mischief in this forest  sir saith he to messire gawain , i am cousin to the poor knight of the wast forestthat hath the two poor damsels to sistr , there where you and lancelot joustd between you , and when the knight that brought you tidings thereof died in the night 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , these tidings know i well , for you say true , and your company hold i right dear for the love of the poor knight , for never yet saw i more courteous knight , nor more courteous damsels , nor better nurtured , and our lord god grant them as much good as i would they should have 
messire gawain made the knight go before , for well knew he the robbers  hold , but loath enough had he been to go thither , had the knights not followed him behind 
lancelot was issued forth of the hold sword in hand , all armed , angry as a lion 
the four knights were upon their horses all armed , but no mind had they come anigh him , for sore draded they the huge buffets he dealt , and his hardiment 
one of them came forward before the others , and it seemed him shame that they might not vanquish one single knight 
he goeth to smite lancelot a great stoke of his sword above in the midstof his head , nor did lancelot s sword fail of its stoke , for before he could drw back , lancelot dealt him such a blow as smote oft all of his leg at the thigh , so that he made him leave the saddlebows empty 
lancelot leapt up on the destier , and now seemed him he was safer than before 
the three robberknights that yet remained whole ran upon him on all sides and began to press him of their swords in right sore wrath 
thereupon behold you , the knight cometh to the way that goeth to the hold and saith to messire gawain and perceval , now may you hear the dashing of swords and the melly 
therewithal the two good knights smite horse with spur and come thither where the three robberknights were assailing lancelot 
each of the twain smiteth his own so wrathfully that they thrusttheir spears right through their bodies and bear them to the ground dead 
howbeit the third knight was fain to flee , but the knight that had come to show messire gawain the way took heart and hardiment from the confidence of the good knights , and smote him as he fled so sore that he pierced him with his spear to the heart and toppled him to the ground dead 
the one whose leg lancelot had lopped off was so trampled underfoot of the knights that he had no life in him 
vi 
when lancelot knew perceval and messire gawain he made great joy of them and they of him 
lancelot , saith messire gawain , this knight that led us hither to save your life is cousin to the poor knight of the wast caste , the brother of the two poor damsels that lodged us so well 
we will send him these horses , one for the knight that shall be the messenger , and the two to the lord of the wast caste , and this hold that we have taken shall be for the two damsels , and so shall we make them safe all the days of their life 
this , methinketh , will be well 
certes , saith perceval , you speak of great courtesy 
sir , saith lancelot , messire gawain hath said , and right willingly will i grant him all his wish 
lords , saith the knight , they have in this foresta hold wherein the knights did bestw their plunder , for the sake whereof they murdered the passers by 
if the goods remain there they will be lost for therein is so great stre as might be of much worth to many folk that are povertysticken for want thereof 
they go to the hold and find right great treasure in a cave underground , and rich sets of vessels and rich ornaments of cloth and armours for horses , that they had thrown the one over another into a pit that was right broad 
certes , saith he , right well hath it been done to this evil folk that is destoyed 
sir , saith lancelot , in like manner would they have dealt with me and killed me if they might 
whereof no sorrow have i save of the damsel that i slew , that was one of the fairestdames of the world 
i slew her not knowingly , for i meant rather to stike the knight , but she leapt between us , like the hardiestdame that saw i ever 
sirs , saith the knight , perceval and lancelot , by the counsel of messire gawain , granted the treasure to the two damsels , sistrs to the poor knight of the wast caste , whereupon let them send for joseus the hermit and bid him guard the treasure until they shall come hither 
joseus said that he would do so , and is right glad that the robbers of the forestare made away withal , that had so often made assault upon him 
he guarded the treasure and the hold right safely in the forest but the drad and the renown of the good knights that had freed the forestwent far and wide 
the knight that led the three destiers was right joyfully received at the wast caste 
when he told the message wherewith he was charged by messire gawain , the poor knight and two damsels made great joy thereof 
perceval taketh leave of messire gawain and lancelot , and saith that never will he restagain until he shall have found his sistr and his widow mother 
they durstnot gainsay him , for they know well that he is right , and he prayeth them right sweetly that they salute the king and queen and all the good knights of the court , for , please god , he will go see them at an early day 
firsthe was fain to fulfil the promise king arthur made to his sistr , for he would not that the king should be blamed in any place as concerning him , nor by his default 
he himself would have the greater blame therein and he succoured her not , for the matter touched him nearer than it did king arthur 
vii 
with that the good knight departeth , and they commend him to god , and he them in like sort 
messire gawain and lancelot go their way back toward the court of king arthur , and perceval goeth amidststange forest until he cometh to a forestfar away , wherein , so it seemed him , he had never been before 
he passed through a land that seemed him to have been laid wast , for it was all void of folk 
wild beastonly seeth he there , that ran through the open country 
he entered into a forestin this wast country , and found a hermitage in the combe of a mountain 
he alighted without and heard that the hermit was singing the service of the dead , and had begun the mass with a requiem betwixt him and his clerk 
he looketh and seeth a pall spread upon the ground before the altar as though it were over a corpse 
he would not enter the chapel armed , wherefore he hearkened to the mass from without right reverently , and showed great devotion as he that loved god much and was adrad 
when the mass was sung , and the hermit was disarmed of the armour of our lord , he cometh to perceval and saluteth him and perceval him again 
sir , saith perceval , for whom have you done such service 
meseemed that the corpse lay therewithin for whom the service was ordained 
you say truth , saith the hermit 
i have done it for lohot , king arthur s son , that lieth buried under this pall 
who , then , hath slain him 
saith perceval 
that will i tell you plainly , saith the hermit 
viii 
this wastd land about this forestwherethrough you have come is the beginning of the kingdom of logres 
there wont to be therein a giant so big and horrible and cruel that none durstwon within half a league round about , and he destoyed the land and wastd it in such sort as you see 
lohot was departed from the land and the court of king arthur his father in questof adventure , and by the will of god arrived at this forest and fought againstlogrin , right cruel as he was , and logrin againsthim 
as it pleased god , lohot vanquished him 
lohot had a marvellous custm  when he had slain a man , he slept upon him 
a knight of king arthur s court , that is called kay the seneschal , was come peradventure into this forestof logres 
he heard the giant roar when lohot dealt him the mortal blow 
thither came he as fistas he might , and found the king s son sleeping upon logrin 
he drw his sword and therewith cut off lohot s head , and took the head and the body and set them in a coffin of stne 
after that he hacked his shield to pieces with his sword , that he should not be recognised 
came he to the giant that lay dead , and so cut oft his head , that was right huge and hideous , and hung it at his fore saddlebow 
went he to the court of king arthur and presented it to him 
the king made great joy thereof and all they of the court , and the king made broad his lands right freely for that he believed kay had spoken true 
i went , saith the hermit , on the morrow to the piece of land where the giant lay dead , as a damsel came within here to tell me with right great joy 
i found the corpse of the giant so big that i durstnot come anigh it 
the damsel led me to the coffin where the king s son was lying 
she asked the head of me as her guerdon , and i granted it to her willingly 
she set it forthwith in a coffer laden with precious stnes that was all garnished within of balsams 
after that , she helped me carry the body into this chapel and enshroud and bury it 
ix 
afterwards the damsel departed , nor have i never heard talk of her since , nor do i make remembrance hereof for that i would king arthur should know it , nor for aught that i say thereof that he should do evil to the knight 
for right sore sin should i have thereof , but deadly treason and disloyalty hath he wrought 
sir , saith perceval , this is sore pity of the king s son , that he is dead in such manner , for i have heard witness that he ever waxed more and more in great chivalry , and , so the king knew thereof , kay the seneschal , that is not wellloved of all folk , would lose the court for ever more , or his life , so he might be taken , and this would be only right and just perceval lay the night in the hermitage , and departed on the morrow when he had heard mass 
he rideth through the forestas he that right gladly would hear tidings of his mother , nor never before hath he been so desirous thereof as is he now 
he heard , at right hour of noon , a damsel under a tree that made greater dole than ever heard he damsel make before 
she held her mule by the reins and was alighted afoot and set herself on her knees toward the east  she stetched her hands up toward heaven and prayed right sweetly the saviour of the world and his sweet mother that they would send her succour betimes , for that the mostdiscounselled damsel of the world was she , and never was alms given to damsel to counsel her so well bestwed as it would be upon her , for that needs mustshe go to the mostperilous place that is in the world , and that , save she might bring some one with her , never would that she had to do be done 
x 
perceval drw himself up when he heard the damsel bemoaning thus 
he was in the shadow of the forestso that she saw him not 
the damsel cried out all weeping , ha , king arthur , great sin did you in forgetting to speak of my business to the knight that bare away the shield from your court , by whom would my mother have been succoured , that now mustlose her caste presently save god grant counsel herein 
so unhappy am i , that i have gone through all the lands of great britain , yet may i hear no tidings of my brother , albeit they say that he is the bestknight of the world 
what availeth us his knighthood , when we have neither aid nor succour thereof 
much the greater shame ought he to have of himself , if he love his mother , as she , that is the mostgentle lady that liveth and the mostloyal , hath hope that , and he knew , he would come thither 
either he is dead or he is in lands so far away that none may hear tidings of him 
ha , sweet lady , mother of our saviour , aid us when we may have no aid of any other 
for if my lady mother loseth her caste , needs mustwe be forlorn wanderers in stange lands , for so have her brothers been long time 
he that had the mostpower and valour lieth in languishment , the good king fisherman that the king of caste mortal warreth on , albeit he also is my uncle , my mother s brother , and would fain reave my uncle , that is his brother , of his caste by his felony 
of a man so evil my lady mother looketh for neither aid nor succour 
the good king pelles hath renounced his kingdom for the love of his saviour , and hath entered into a hermitage 
he likewise is brother of my mother , and behoveth him make war upon none , for the mostworshipful hermit is he of the world 
all they on my father s side have died in arms 
eleven were there of them , and my father was the twelfth 
had they remained on live , well able would they have been to succour us , but the knight that was firstat the graal hath undone us , for through him our uncle fell in languishment , in whom should have been our surestsuccour 
xi 
at this word perceval rode forward , and the damsel heareth him 
she riseth up , and looketh backward and seeth the knight come , the shield at his neck banded argent and azure , with a red cross 
she clasped her two hands toward heaven , and saith , ha , sweet lady that didstbear the saviour of the world , you have not forgotten me , nor never may be discounselled he nor she that calleth upon you with the heart 
here see i the knight come of whom we shall have aid and succour , and our lord god grant him will to do his pleasure , and lend him courage and stength to protect us 
she goeth to meet him , and holdeth his strrup and would have kissed his foot , but he avoideth it and crieth to her  ill do you herein , damsel 
therewith she melteth in tears of weeping and prayeth him right sweetly 
sir , saith she , of such pity as god had of his mostsweet mother on that day he took his death , when he beheld her at the foot of the cross , have pity and mercy of my lady mother and of me 
for , and your aid fail us , we know not to whom to fly for rescue , for i have been told that you are the bestknight of the world 
for obtaining of your help went i to king arthur s court 
wherefore succour us for pity s sake and god s and for nought beside , for , so please you , it is your duty so to do , albeit , had you been my brother that is also such a knight as you , whom i cannot find , i might have called upon you of a greater right 
sir , saith she , do you remember you of the brachet you had at the court waiting for you until such time as you should come for the shield , and that went away with you , how he would never make joy nor know any save me alone 
by this know i well that if you knew the soreness of our need you would succour us 
king arthur , that should have prayed you thereof , forgat it 
damsel , saith he , so much hath he done that he hath not failed of his covenant with you , for he sent for me by the two bestknights of his court , and 
i may speed , so much will i do herein as that god and he shall be well pleased thereof 
xii 
the damsel had right great joy of the knight that he should grant her his aid , but she knew not he was her brother , or otherwise she would have doubled her joy 
perceval knoweth well that she is his sistr , but he would not yet discover himself and manifesthis pity outwardly 
he helpeth the damsel to mount again and they rode on together 
sir , saith the damsel , needs musti go tonight by myself to the graveyard perilous 
wherefore go you thither 
saith perceval 
sir , saith she , i have made vow thereof , and moreover a holy hermit hath told me that the knight that warreth upon us may not be overcome of no knight , save i bring him not some of the cloth wherewith the altar in the chapel of the graveyard perilous is covered 
the cloth is of the mostholiest for our lord god was covered therewith in the holy sepulchre , on the third day when he came back from death to life 
nor none may enter the holy graveyard that bringeth another with him , wherefore behoveth me go by myself , and may god save my life this night , for the place is sore perilous , and so ought i greatly to hate him that hath procured me this dolour and travail 
sir , saith she , you will go your way toward the caste of camelot  there is the widow lady my mother , that awaiteth the return and the succour of the good knight , and may you remember to succour and aid us when you shall see how sore is our need of succour 
xiii 
damsel , saith perceval , so god allow me i will aid you to the utmostof my power 
sir , saith she , see , this is my way , that is but little frequented , for i tell you that no knight dursttread therein without great peril and great drad 
our lord god have your body in keeping , for mine own this night shall be in sore jeopardy and hazard 
perceval departeth from the damsel , his sistr , and hath right great pity for that she goeth in so perilous place all alone 
natheless would he nor forbid her , for he knew well that she might not go thither with him nor with other , sith that such was the custm of the graveyard that twain might not pass the entrance , wherefore needs mustone remain without 
perceval was not willing that his sistr should break her vow , for never none of his lineage did at any time disloyalty nor base deed knowingly , nor failed of nought that they had in covenant , save only the king of caste mortal , from whom he had as much evil as he had good of the others 
xiv 
the damsel goeth her way all alone and all forlorn toward the graveyard and the deep of the forest all dark and shadowy 
she hath ridden until the sun was set and the night drweth nigh 
she looketh before her and seeth a cross , high and wide and thick 
on this cross was the figure of our lord graven , whereof is she greatly comforted 
she drweth nigh the cross , and so kisseth and adoreth it , and prayeth the saviour of the world that was nailed on holy rood that he would bring her forth of the burialground with honour 
the cross was at the entrance of the graveyard , that was right spacious , for , from such time as the land was firstpeopled of folk , and that knights began to seek adventure by the forest not a knight had died in the forest that was full great of breadth and length , but his body was borne thither , nor might never knight there be buried that had not received baptism and had repented him not of his sins at his death 
xv 
thereinto entered the damsel all alone , and found great multitude of tombs and coffins 
nor none need wonder whether she had shuddering and fear , for such place mustneeds be dradful to a lonely damsel , there where lay so many knights that had been slain in arms 
josephus the good clerk witnesseth us that within the graveyard might no evil spirit meddle , for that saint andrw the aposte had blessed it with his hand 
never might no hermit remain within for the evil things that appeared each night all round about , that took the shapes of the knights that were dead in the forest wherof the bodies lay not in the blessed burialground 
xvi 
the damsel beholdeth their sepulchres all round about the grave yard whereinto she was come 
she seeth them surrounded of knights , all black , and spears had they withal , and came one againstanother , and made such uproar and alarm as it seemed all the forestresounded thereof 
the mostpart held swords all red as of fire , and ran either upon other , and gashed one another s hands and feet and nose and face 
great was the clashing they made , but they could not come anigh the graveyard 
the damsel seeth them , and hath such affright thereof that she nigh fell to the ground in a swoon 
the mule whereon she sate drweth wide his nostils and goeth in much fear 
the damsel signeth her of the cross and commendeth her to the saviour and to his sweet mother 
she looketh before her to the head of the graveyard , and seeth the chapel , small and ancient 
she smiteth her mule with her whip , and cometh thitherward and alighteth 
she entered therewithin and found a great brightness of light 
within was an image of our lady , to whom she prayeth right sweetly that she will preserve her senses and her life and enable her to depart in safety from this perilous place 
she seeth above the altar the mostholy cloth for the which she was come thither , that was right ancient , and a smell came thereof so sweet and glorious that no sweetness of the world might equal it 
the damsel cometh toward the altar thinking to take the cloth , but it goeth up into the air as if the wind had lifted it , and was so high that she might not reach it above an ancient crucifix that was there within 
ha , god 
saith the damsel , it is for my sin and my disloyalty that this mostholy cloth thus drweth itself away from me 
xvii 
fair father god , never did i evil to none , nor never did i shame nor sinned deadly in myself , nor never wrought againstyour will , so far as in me lay , but rather do i serve you and love and fear you and your sweet mother 
all the tribulation i receive , accept i in patience for your love , for well i know that such is your pleasure , nor have i no will to set myself againstnought that pleaseth you 
xviii 
when it shall please you , you will release me and my mother of the grief and tribulation wherein we are 
for well you know that they have reaved her of her castes by wrong , and of her land , for that she is a widow lady without help 
lord , you who have all the world at your mercy and do your commandment in all things , grant me betimes to hear tidings of my brother and he be on live , for sore need have we of him 
so lend force to the knight and power againstall our enemies , that for your love and for pity is fain to succour and aid my mother that is sore discounselled 
lord , well might it beseem you to remember of your pity and the sweetness that is in you , and of compassion that she hath been unrighteously disherited , and that no succour nor aid nor counsel hath she , save of you alone 
you are her affiance and her succour , and therefore ought you to remember that the good knight joseph of abarimacie , that took down your body when it hung upon the rood , was her own uncle 
better loved he to take down your body than all the gold and all the fee that pilate might give him 
lord , good right of very truth had he so to do , for he took you in his arms beside the rood , and laid your body in the holy sepulchre , wherein were you covered of the sovran cloth for the which have i come in hither 
lord , grant it be your pleasure that i may have it , for love of the knight by whom it was set in this chapel 
sith that i am of his lineage it ought well to manifestitself in this sore need , so it come according to your pleasure 
forthwith the cloth came down above the altar , and she staightway found taken away therefrom as much as it pleased our lord she should have 
josephus telleth us of a truth , that never did none enter into the chapel that might touch the cloth save only this one damsel 
she set her face to it and her mouth or ever the cloth removed 
xix 
thereafter , she took the piece that god would and set it near herself full worshipfully , but stll the stut went on of the evil spirits round about the churchyard , and they dealt one another blows so sore that all the forestresounded thereof , and it seemed that it was all set on fire of the flame that issued from them 
great fear would the damsel have had of them , had she not comforted herself in god and in his dear , sweet mother , and the mostholy cloth that was within there 
a voice appeared upon the stoke of midnight from above the chapel , and speaketh to the souls whereof the bodies lie within the graveyard  how sore loss hath befallen you of late , and all other whose bodies lie in other hallowed churchyards by the forest of this kingdom 
for the good king fisherman is dead that made every day our service be done in the mostholy chapel there where the mostholy graal every day appeared , and where the mother of god abode from the saturday until the monday that the service was finished 
now hath the king of caste mortal seized the caste in such sort that never sithence hath the holy graal appeared , and all the other hallows are hidden , so that none knoweth what hath become of the priest that served in the chapel , nor the twelve ancient knights , nor the damsels that were therein 
you , damsel , that are within , have no affiance in the aid of stange knight in this need , for succoured may you never be save of your brother only 
with that the voice is stll , and a wailing and a lamentation goeth up from the bodies that lay in the churchyard , so dolorous that no man is there in the world but should have pity thereof , and all the evil spirits that were without departed groaning and making so mighty uproar at their going away that it seemed the earth trembled 
the damsel heard the tidings of her uncle that was dead , and fell on the ground in a swoon , and when she raised herself , took on to lament and cried  ha , god 
now have we lostthe mostcomfort and the bestfriend that we had , and hereof am i again discomforted that i may not be succoured in this my next need by the good knight of whom i thought to have succour and aid , and that was so fain to render it 
now shall i know not what to ask of him , for he would grant it right willingly , and may god be as pleased with him thereof as if he had done it 
the damsel was in sore misdoubting and dismay , for she knew not who the knight was , and great misgiving had she of her uncle s death and right sore sorrow 
she was in the chapel until it was day , and then commended herself to god and departed and mounted on her mule and issued forth of the churchyard full speed , all alone 
the stry saith that the damsel went her way toward her mother s caste as staight as she might , but sore dismayed was she of the voice that had told her she might not be succoured save of her brother alone 
she hath ridden so far of her journeys that she is come to the valley of camelot , and seeth her mother s caste that was surrounded of great rivers , and seeth perceval , that was alighted under the shadow of a tree at the top of the forestin order that he might behold his mother s caste , whence he went forth squire what time he slew the knight of the red shield 
when he had looked well at the caste and the country round about , much pleasure had he thereof , and mounted again forthwith 
thereupon , behold you , the damsel cometh 
sir , saith she , in sore travail and jeopardy have i been sithence that lasti saw you , and tidings have i heard as bad as may be , and right grievous for my mother and myself 
for king fisherman mine uncle is dead , and another of my uncles , the king of caste mortal , hath seized his caste , albeit my lady mother ought rather to have it , or i , or my brother 
is it true  saith perceval , that he is dead 
yea , certes , sir , i know it of a truth 
help me god 
saith he , this misliketh me right sore 
i thought not that he would die so soon , for i have not been to see him of a long time 
sir , saith she , i am much discomforted as concerning you , for i have likewise been told that no force nor aid of any knight may avail to succour nor aid me from this day forward save my brother s help alone 
wherefore , and it be so , we have lostall , for my lady mother hath respite to be in her caste only until the fifteenth day from today , and i know not where to seek my brother , and the day is so nigh as you hear 
now behoveth us do the bestwe may and abandon this caste betimes , nor know i any refuge that we now may have save only king pelles in the hermitage 
i would fain that my lady mother were there , for he would not fail us 
perceval is silent , and hath great pity in his heart of this that the damsel saith 
she followeth him weeping , and pointeth out to him the valleys of camelot and the castes that were shut in by combes and mountains , and the broad meadowlands and the forestthat girded them about 
sir , saith she , all this hath the lord of the moors reaved of my lady mother , and nought coveteth he so much as to have this caste , and have it he will , betimes 
when they had ridden until that they drw nigh the caste , the lady was at the windows of the hall and knew her daughter 
ha , god 
saith the lady , i see there my daughter coming , and a knight with her 
fair father god , grant of your pleasure that it be my son , for and it be not he , i have lostmy caste and mine heirs are disherited 
perceval cometh nigh the caste in company with his sistr , and knoweth again the chapel that stod upon four columns of marble between the forestand the caste , there where his father told him how much ought he to love good knights , and that none earthly thing might be of greater worth , and how none might know yet who lay in the coffin until such time as the bestknight of the world should come thither , but that then should it be known 
perceval would fain have passed by the chapel , but the damsel saith to him  sir , no knight passeth hereby save he go firstto see the coffin within the chapel 
he alighteth and setteth the damsel to the ground , and layeth down his spear and shield and cometh toward the tomb , that was right fair and rich 
he set his hand above it 
soon as he came nigh , the sepulchre openeth on one side , so that one saw him that was within the coffin 
the damsel falleth at his feet for joy 
the lady had a custm such that every time a knight stpped at the coffin she made the five ancient knights that she had with her in the caste accompany her , wherein they would never fail her , and bring her as far as the chapel 
soon as she saw the coffin open and the joy her daughter made , she knew that it was her son , and ran to him and embraced him and kissed him and began to make the greatestjoy that ever lady made 
now know i well , saith she , that our lord god hath not forgotten me 
sith that i have my son again , the tribulations and the wrongs that have been done me grieve me not any more 
sir , saith she to her son , now is it well known and proven that you are the bestknight of the world 
for otherwise never would the coffin have opened , nor would any have known who he is that you now see openly 
she maketh her chaplain take certain letters that were sealed with gold in the coffin 
he looketh thereat and readeth , and then saith that these letters witness of him that lieth in the coffin that he was one of them that helped to unnail our lord from the cross 
they looked beside him and found the pincers all bloody wherewith the nails were drwn , but they might not take them away , nor the body , nor the coffin , according as josephus telleth us , for as soon as perceval was forth of the chapel , the coffin closed again and joined together even as it was before 
the widow lady led her son with right great joy into her caste , and recounted to him all the shame that had been done her , and also how messire gawain had made safe the caste for a year by his good knighthood 
fair son , saith she , now is the term drwn nigh when i should have lostmy caste and you had not come 
now know i well that it shall be safeguarded of you 
he that coveteth this caste is one of the mostoutrageous knights on live 
he hath reaved me of my land and the valleys of camelot without reasonable occasion 
please god , you shall well repair the harm he hath done you , for nought claim i any longer of the land since you are come 
so avenge your shame as to increase your honour , for none ought to allow his right to be minished of an evil man , and the mischiefs that have been done me for that i had no aid , let them not wax cold in you , for a shame done to one valiant and stong ought not to wax cold in him , but rankle and prick in him , so ought he to have his enemies in remembrance without making semblant , but so much as he shall show in his cheer and making semblant and his menaces , so much ought he to make good in deed when he shall come in place 
for one cannot do too much hurt to an enemy , save only one is willing to let him be for god s sake 
truth it is that the scripture saith , that one ought not to do evil to one s enemies , but pray god that he amend them 
i would fain that our enemies were such that they might amend toward us , and that they would do as much good to us without harming themselves as they have done evil , on condition that mine anger and yours were foregone againstthem 
mine own anger i freely forbear againstthem so far forth as concerneth myself , for no need have i to wish evil to none , and solomon telleth how the sinner that curseth other sinner curseth himself likewise 
fair son , this caste is yours , and this land round about whereof i have been reft ought to be yours of right , for it falleth to you on behalf of your father and me 
wherefore send to the lord of the moors that hath reft it from me , that he render it to you 
i make no further claim , for i pass it on to you 
for nought have i now to do with any land save only so much as will be enough wherein to bury my body when i die , nor shall i now live much longer since king fisherman my brother is dead , whereof right sorrowful am i at heart , and stll more sorrowful should i be were it not for your coming 
son , i tell you plainly that you have great blame of his death , for you are the knight through whom he fell firstinto languishment , for now at lasti know well that and if you had afterwards gone back and so  made the demand that you made not at the first he would have come back to health 
our lord god willed it so to be , wherefore well beseemeth us to yield to his will and pleasure 
perceval hath heard his mother , but right little hath he answered her , albeit greatly is he pleased with whatsoever she hath said 
his face is toflushed of hardiment , and courage hath taken hold on him 
his mother looketh at him right fainly , and hath him disarmed and apparelled in a right rich robe 
comely a knight was he that in all the world might not be found one of better seeming nor better shapen of body 
the lord of the moors , that made full certain of having his mother s caste , knew of perceval s coming 
he was not at all dismayed in semblant , nor would he stnt to ride by fell nor forest and every day he weened in his pride that the caste should be his own at the hour and the term he had set thereof 
one of the five knights of the widow lady was one day gone into the lonely forestafter hart and hind , and had taken thereof at his will 
he was returning back to the caste and the huntsmen with him , when the lord of the moors met him and told him he had done great hardiment in shooting with the bow in the forest and the knight made answer that the forestwas not his of right , but the lady s of camelot and her son s that had repaired thither 
the lord of the moors waxed wroth 
he held a sword in his hand and thrusthim therewith through the body and slew him 
the knight was borne dead to the caste of camelot before the widow lady and her son 
fair son , saith the widow lady , more presents of suchlike kind the lord of the moors sendeth me than i would 
never may he be satisfied of harming my land and shedding the blood of the bodies of my knights 
now may you well know how many a hurt he hath done me sithence that your father hath been dead and you were no longer at the caste , sith that this hath he done me even now that you are here 
you have the name of perceval on this account , that tofore you were born , he had begun to reave your father of the valleys of camelot , for your father was an old knight and all his brethren were dead , and therefore he gave you this name in baptism , for that he would remind you of the mischief done to him and to you , and that you might help to retrieve it and you should have the power 
the dame maketh shroud the knight , for whom she is full sorrowful , and on the morrow hath mass sung and burieth him 
perceval made arm two of the old knights with him , then issued forth of the caste and entered the great dark forest  he rode until he came before a caste , and met five knights that issued forth all armed 
he asked whose men they were 
they answer , the lord s of the moors , and that he goeth seek the son of the widow lady that is in the forest if we may deliver him up to our lord , good guerdon shal we have thereof 
by my faith , saith perceval , you have not far to seek 
i am here 
perceval smiteth his horse of his spurs and cometh to the firstin such sort that he passeth his spear right through his body and beareth him to the ground dead 
the other two knights each smote his man so that they wounded them in the body right sore 
the other two would fain have fled , but perceval preventeth them , and they gave themselves up prisoners for fear of death 
he bringeth all four to the caste of camelot and presenteth them to his lady mother 
lady , saith he , see here the quittance for your knight that was slain , and the fifth also remaineth lying on the piece of ground shent in like manner as was your own 
fair son , saith she , i should have better loved peace after another sort , and so it might be 
lady , saith he , thus is it now 
one ought to make war againstthe warrior , and be at peace with the peaceable 
the knights are put in prison 
the tidings are come to the lord of the moors that the son of the widow lady hath slain one of his knights and carried off four to prison 
thereof hath he right great wrath at heart , and sweareth and stndeth to it that never will he be at restuntil he shall have either taken or slain him , and that , so there were any knight in his land that would deliver him up , he would give him one of the bestcastes in his country 
the more part are keen to take perceval 
eight came for that intent before him all armed in the forestof camelot , and hunted and drve wild deer in the purlieus of the forestso that they of the caste saw them 
perceval was in his mother s chapel , where he heard mass 
when the mass was sung , his sistr said  fair brother , see here the mostholy cloth that i brought from the chapel of the graveyard perilous 
kiss it and touch it with your face , for a holy hermit told me that never should our land be conquered back until such time as you should have hereof 
perceval kisseth it , then toucheth his eyes and face therewith 
afterward he goeth to arm him , and the four knights with him 
he issueth forth of the chamber and mounteth on his horse , then goeth out of the gateway like a lion unchained 
he sitteth on a tall horse all covered 
he cometh nigh the eight knights that were all armed , man and horse , and asketh them what folk they be and what they seek , and they say that they are enemies of the widow lady and her son 
you do i defy 
saith perceval 
he cometh to them a great run , and the four knights with him , and each one overthroweth his own man so roughly that either he is wounded in his body or maimed of arm or leg 
the restheld the melly to the utmostthey might endure 
perceval made take them and bring to the caste , and the other five that they had overthrown 
the lord of the moors was come to shoot with a bow , and he heard the noise of the knights , and cometh thitherward a great gallop all armed 
sir , saith one of the old knights to perceval , look 
here is the lord of the moors coming , that hath reft your mother of her land and slain her men 
of him will it be good to take vengeance 
see , how boldly he cometh 
perceval looketh on him as he that loveth him not , and cometh toward him as hard as his horse may carry him , and smiteth him right through the breastso stongly that he beareth to the ground him and his horse together all in a heap 
he alighteth to the ground and drweth his sword 
how 
saith the lord of the moors , would you then slay me and put me in worse plight than i am 
by my head , saith perceval , no , nor so swiftly , but i will slay you enough , betimes 
it seemeth you , saith the lord of the moors , but it shall not be yet 
he leapeth up on his feet and runneth on perceval , sword drwn , as one that fain would harm him if he might 
perceval defendeth himself as good knight should , and giveth such a buffet at the outset as smiteth off his arm together with his sword 
the knights that came after fled back all discomfited when they saw their lord wounded 
perceval made lift him on a horse and carry him to the caste and presenteth him to his mother 
lady , saith he , see here the lord of the moors 
well might you expect him eftsoons , sith that you were to have yielded him up your caste the day after tomorrow 
lady , saith the lord of the moors , your son hath wounded me and taken my knights and myself likewise 
i will yield you up your caste albeit i hold it mine as of right , on condition you cry me quit 
who shall repay her , saith perceval , for the shame that you have done her , for her knights that you have slain , whereof never had you pity 
now , so help me god , if she have mercy or pity upon you , never hereafter will i trouble to come to her aid how sore soever may be her need 
such pity and none other as you have had for her and my sistr will i have for you 
our lord god commanded in both the old law and the new , that justce should be done upon manslayers and traitors , and justce will i do upon you that his commandment be not transgressed 
he hath a great vat made ready in the midstof the court , and maketh the eleven knights be brought 
h e maketh their heads be sticken off into the vat and bleed therein as much blood as might come from them , and then made the heads and the bodies be drwn forth so that nought was there but blood in the vat 
after that , he made disarm the lord of the moors and be brought before the vat wherein was great abundance of blood 
he made bind his feet and his hands right stait , and after that saith  never might you be satisfied of the blood of the knights of my lady mother , now will i satisfy you of the blood of your own knights 
he maketh hang him by the feet in the vat , so that his head were in the blood as far as the shoulders , and so maketh him be held there until that he was drwned and quenched 
after that , he made carry his body and the bodies of the other knights and their heads , and made them be castinto an ancient charnel that was beside an old chapel in the forest and the vat together with the blood made he be castinto the river , so that the water thereof was all bloody 
the tidings came to the castes that the son of the widow lady had slain the lord of the moors and the bestof his knights 
thereof were they in sore misgiving , and the mostpart said that the like also would he do to them save they held themselves at his commandment 
they brought him the keys of all the castes that had been reft of his mother , and all the knights that had before renounced their allegiance returned thereunto and pledged themselves to be at his will for drad of death 
all the land was assured in safety , nor was there nought to trouble the lady s joy save only that king fisherman her brother was dead , whereof she was right sorrowful and sore afflicted 
one day the widow lady sate at meat , and there was great plenty of knights in the hall 
perceval sate him beside his sistr 
thereupon , behold you the damsel of the car that came with the other two damsels before the widow lady and her son , and saluted them right nobly 
damsel , saith perceval , good adventure may you have 
sir , saith she , you have speeded right well of your business here , now go speed it elsewhere , for thereof is the need right sore 
king hermit , that is your mother s brother , sendeth you word that , and you come not with hast into the land that was king fisherman s your uncle , the new law that god hath stblished will be sore brought low 
for the king of caste mortal , that hath seized the land and caste , hath made be cried throughout all the country how all they that would fain maintain the old law and abandon the new shall have protection of him and counsel and aid , and they that will not shall be destoyed and outlawed 
ha , fair son , saith the widow lady , now have you heard the great disloyalty of the evil man that is my brother , whereof am i right sorrowful , for that he is of my kindrd 
lady , saith perceval , your brother nor my uncle is he no longer , sith that he denieth god 
rather is he our mortal enemy that we ought of right to hate more than any stanger 
fair son , saith the widow lady , i pray and beseech you that the law of the saviour be not set aside in forgetfulness and neglect there where you may exalt it , for better lord in no wise may you serve , nor one that better knoweth how to bestw fair guerdon 
fair son , none may be good knight that serveth him not and loveth him 
take heed that you be swift in his service nor delay not for no intent , but be ever at his commandment alike at eventide as in the morning , so shall you not bely your lineage 
the lord god grant you good intent therein and good will to go on even as you have begun 
the widow lady , that much loved her son , riseth up from the tables , and all the other knights , and seemeth it that she is lady of her land in such sort as that never was she better 
full often doth she give thanks to the saviour of the world with her whole heart , and prayeth him of his pleasure grant her son length of life for the amendment both of soul and body 
perceval was with his mother of a long space , and with his sistr , and was much feared and honoured of all the knights of the land , alike for his great wisdom and great painstking , as well as for the valour of his knighthood

title i 
this high histry saith that messire gawain and lancelot were repaired to the court of king arthur from the questthey had achieved 
the king made great joy thereof and the queen 
king arthur sate one day at meat by the side of the queen , and they had been served of the firstmeats 
thereupon come two knights all armed , and each bore a dead knight before him , and the knights were stll armed as they had been when their bodies were alive 
sir , say the knights , this shame and this mischief is yours 
in like manner will you lose all your knights betimes and god love you not well enough to give counsel herein forthwith of his mercy 
lords , saith the king , how came these knights to be in so evil case 
sir , say they , it is of good right you ought to know 
the knight of the fiery drgon is entered into the head of your land , and is destoying knights and castes and whatsoever he may lay hands on , in such sort that none durstcontend againsthim , for he is taller by a foot than any knight ever you had , and of grisly cheer , and so is his sword three times bigger than the sword of ever another knight , and his spear is well as heavy as a man may carry 
two knights might lightly cover them of his shield , and it hath on the outer side the head of a drgon that castth forth fire and flame whensoever he will , so eager and biting that none may long endure his encounter 
ii 
none other , how stong soever he be , may stnd againsthim , and , even as you see , hath he burnt and evilentreated all other knights that have withstod him 
from what land hath come such manner of man 
sir , say the knights , he is come from the giant s caste , and he warreth upon you for the love of logrin the giant , whose head messire kay brought you into your court , nor never , saith he , will he have joy until such time as he shall have avenged him on your body or upon the knight that you love best our lord god , saith the king , will defend us from so evil a man 
he is risen from the table , all scared , and maketh carry the two dead knights to be buried , and the others turn back again when they have told their message 
the king calleth messire gawain and lancelot and asketh them what he shall do of this knight that is entered into his land 
by my head , i know not what to say , save you give counsel herein 
sir , saith lancelot , we will go againsthim , so please you , i and messire gawain between us 
by my head , saith the king , i would not let you go for a kingdom , for such man as is this is no knight but a devil and a fiend that hath issued from the borders of hell 
i say not but that it were great worship and prize to slay and conquer him , but he that should go againsthim should set his own life in right sore jeopardy and run great hazard of being in as bad plight as these two knights i have seen 
the king was in such dismay that he knew not neither what to say nor to do , and so was all the court likewise in such sort as no knight neither one nor another was minded to go to battle with him , and so remained the court in great dismay

he hath departed with her good will and the good will of his sistr , and telleth them he will return into the land as speedily as he may 
he entereth into the great lonely forest and rideth so far on his journeys that he cometh one day at the right hour of noon into a passing fair launde , and seeth a forest  he looketh amidstthe launde and seeth a red cross 
he looketh to the head of the launde and seeth a right comely knight sitting in the shadow of the forest and he was clad in white garments and held a vessel of gold in his hand 
at the other end of the launde he seeth a damsel likewise sitting , young and gentle and of passing great beauty , and she was clad in a white samite drpped of gold 
josephus telleth us by the divine scripture that out of the forestissued a beast white as drven snow , and it was bigger than a fox and less than a hare 
the beastcame into the launde all scared , for she had twelve hounds in her belly , that questd within like as it were hounds in a wood , and she fled adown the launde for fear of the hounds , the questng whereof she had within her 
perceval restd on the shaft of his spear to look at the marvel of this beast whereof he had right great pity , so gentle was she of semblance , and of so passing beauty , and by her eyes it might seem that they were two emeralds 
she runneth to the knight , all affrighted , and when she hath been there awhile and the hounds rend her again , she runneth to the damsel , but neither there may she sty long time , for the hounds that are within her cease not of their questng , whereof is she sore adrad 
ii 
she durstnot venture herself in the forest  she seeth perceval and so cometh toward him for protection 
she maketh as though she would lie down on his horse s neck , and he holdeth forth his hands to receive her there so as that she might not hurt herself , and evermore the hounds questd 
howbeit the knight crieth out to him , sir knight , let the beastgo and hold her not , for this belongeth neither to you nor to other , but let her dre her weird 
the beastseeth that no protection hath she 
she goeth to the cross , and forthwith might the hounds no longer be in her , but issued forth all as it were live hounds , but nought had they of her gentleness nor her beauty 
she humbled herself much among them and crouched on the ground and made semblant as though she would have cried them mercy , and gat herself as nigh the cross as she might 
the hounds had compassed her round about and ran in upon her upon all sides and tore her all to pieces with their teeth , but no power had they to devour her flesh , nor to remove it away from the cross 
iii 
when the hounds had all tomangled the beast they fled away into the wood as had they been raging mad 
the knight and the damsel came there where the beastlay in pieces at the cross , and so taketh each his part and setteth the same on their golden vessels , and took the blood that lay upon the earth in like manner as the flesh , and kiss the place , and adore the cross , and then betake them into the forest  perceval alighteth and setteth him on his knees before the cross and so hisseth and adoreth it , and the place where the beastwas slain , in like manner as he had seen the knight and damsel do 
there came to him a smell so sweet of the cross and of the place , such as no sweetness may be compared therewith 
he looketh and seeth coming from the foresttwo priest all afoot 
the firstshouteth to him  sir knight , withdrw yourself away from the cross , for no right have you to come nigh it 
perceval drweth him back , and the priestkneeleth before the cross and adoreth it and boweth down and kisseth it more than a score times , and manifestth the mostjoy in the world 
the other priestcometh after , and bringeth a great rod , and setteth the firstpriestaside by force , and beateth the cross with the rod in every part , and weepeth right passing sore 
iv 
perceval beholdeth him with right great wonderment , and saith unto him , sir , herein seem you to be no priest  wherefore do you so great shame 
sir , saith the priest it nought concerneth you of whatsoever we may do , nor nought shall you know thereof for us 
had he not been a priest perceval would have been right wroth with him , but he had no will to do him any hurt 
therewithal he departeth and mounteth his horse and entereth the forestagain , all armed , but scarce had he ridden away in such sort or ever he met the knight coward , that cried out to him as far as he could see him , sir , for god s sake , take heed to yourself 
what manner man are you 
saith perceval 
sir , saith he , my name is the knight coward , and i am man of the damsel of the car 
wherefore i pray you for god s sake and for your own valour that you touch me not 
perceval looketh on him and seeth him tall and comely and wellshapen and adrit and all armed upon his horse , so he saith to him , sith that you are so coward , wherefore are you armed thus 
sir , saith he , againstthe evil intent of any knight of whom i am adrad , for such an one might haply meet me as would slay me forthwith 
v 
are you so coward as you say 
saith perceval 
yea , saith he , and much more 
by my head , saith he , i will make you hardy 
come now along with me , for sore pity is it that cowardize should harbour in so comely a knight 
i am fain that your name be changed speedily , for such name beseemeth no knight 
ha , sir , for god s sake , mercy 
now know i well that you desire to slay me 
no will have i to change neither my courage nor my name 
by my head , saith perceval , then will you die therefor , betimes 
he maketh him go before him , will he or nill he 
the knight goeth accordingly with right sore grudging 
they had scarce ridden away , when he heard in the forestoff the way , two damsels that bewailed them right sore , and prayed our lord god send them succour betimes 
vi 
perceval cometh towards them , he and the knight he drveth before him perforce , and seeth a tall knight all armed that leadeth the damsels all dishevelled , and smiteth them from time to time with a great rod , so that the blood ran down their faces 
ha , sir knight , saith perceval , what ask you of these two damsels that you entreat so churlishly 
sir , saith he , they have disherited me of mine own hold in this forestthat messire gawain gave them 
sir , say they to perceval , this knight is a robber , and none other but he now wonneth in this forest for the other robber knights were slain by messire gawain and lancelot and another knight that came with them , and , for the sore suffering and poverty that messire gawain and lancelot saw in us aforetime , and in the house of my brother in whose caste they lay , were they fain to give us this hold and the treasure they conquered from the robberknights , and for this doth he now lead us away to slay and destoy us , and as much would he do for you and all other knights , so only he had the power 
sir knight , saith perceval , let be these damsels , for well i know that they say true , for that i was there when the hold was given them 
you helped to slay my kindrd , saith the knight , and therefore you do i defy 
ha , saith the knight coward to perceval , take no heed of that he saith , and wax not wroth , but go your way 
certes , saith perceval , this will i not do  rather will i help to challenge the honour of the damsels 
vii 
ha , sir , saith the knight coward , never shall it be challenged of me 
perceval drweth him back 
sir , saith he , see here my champion that i set in my place 
the robber knight moveth toward him , and smiteth him so sore on the shield that he breaketh his spear , but he might not unseat the coward knight , that sate stll upright as aforehand in the saddlebows 
he 1ooketh at the other knight that hath drwn his sword 
the knight coward 1ooketh on the one side and the other , and would fain have fled and he durst  but perceval crieth to him  knight , do your endeavour to save my honour and your own life and the honour of these two damsels 
the robberknight dealeth him a great buffet of his sword so as that it went nigh to stn him altogether 
howbeit the coward knight moveth not 
perceval looketh at him in wonderment and thinketh him that he hath set too craven a knight in his place , and now at lastknoweth well that he spake truth 
the , robber knight smiteth him all over his body and giveth him so many buffets that the knight seeth his own blood 
by my head , saith he , you have wounded me , but you shall pay therefor , for i supposed not that you were minded to slay me 
he drweth his sword , that was sharp and stong , and smiteth his horse right sore hard of his spurs , and catcheth the knight with his sword right in the midstof his breastwith a sweep so stong that he beareth him to the ground beside his horse 
he alighteth over him , unlaceth his ventail and smiteth down his coif , then stiketh off his head and presenteth it to perceval 
sir , saith he , here give i you of my firstjoust by my head , said perceval , right dearly love i this present 
now take heed that you never again fall back into the cowardize wherein you have been 
for it is too sore shame to a knight 
sir , saith he , i will not , but never should i have believed that one could become hardy so speedily , or otherwise long ago would i have become so , and so should i have had worship and honour thereof , for many a knight hath held me in contempt herein , that elsewise would have honoured me 
perceval answereth that right and reason it is that worshipful men should be more honoured than the other 
i commend these two damsels to your protection , and lead them to their hold in safety , and be at their pleasure and their will , and so say everywhere that you have for name the knight hardy , for more of courtesy hath this name than the other 
sir , saith he , you say true , and you have i to thank for the name 
the damsels give great thanks to perceval , and take leave of him , and so go their way with right good will toward the knight that goeth with them on account of the knight he had slain , so that thereof called they him the knight hardy 
viii 
perceval departeth from the place where the knight lieth dead , and rideth until that he drweth nigh to cardoil where king arthur was , and findeth the country round in sore terror and dismay 
much he marvelleth wherefore it may be , and demandeth of some of the meaner sort wherefore they are in so sore affright 
doth the king , then , live no longer 
sir , say the mostpart , yea , he is there within in this caste , but never was he so destoyed nor so scared as he is at this present 
for a knight warreth upon him againstwhom no knight in the world may endure 
perceval rideth on until he cometh before the mastr hall , and is alighted on the mountingstge 
lancelot and messire gawain come to meet him and make much joy of him , as do the king and queen and all they of the court 
they made disarm him and do upon him a right rich robe 
they that had never seen him before looked upon him right fainly for the worship and valour of his knighthood 
the court also was rejoiced because of him , for sore troubled had it been 
as the king sate one day at meat , there came four knights into the hall , and each one of them bore before him a dead knight 
their feet and arms had been sticken off , but their bodies were stll all armed , and the habergeons thereon were all black as though they had been blastd of lightning 
they laid the knights in the midstof the hall 
sir , say they to the king , once more is made manifestthis shame that is done you that is not yet amended 
the knight of the drgon destoyeth you your land and slayeth your men and cometh as nigh us as he may , and saith that in your court shall never be found knight so hardy as that he durstabide him or assault him 
right sore shame hath the king of these tidings , and messire gawain and lancelot likewise 
right sorrowful are they of heart for that the king would not allow them to go thither 
the four knights turn back again and leave the dead knights in the hall , but the king maketh them be buried with the others 
ix 
a great murmuring ariseth amongstthe knights in the hall , and the mostpart say plainly that they never heard tell of none that slew knights in such cruel sort , nor so many as did he 
that neither messire gawain nor lancelot ought to be blamed for that they went not thither , for no knight in the world might conquer such a man and our lord god did not , for he castth forth fire and flame from his shield whensoever him listth 
while this murmur was going on between the knights all round about the hall , behold you therewithal the damsel that made bear the knight in the horsebier and cometh before the king 
sir , saith she , i pray and beseech you that you do me right in your court 
see , here is messire gawain that was at the assembly in the red launde where were many knights , and among them was the son of the widow lady , that i see sitting beside you 
he and messire gawain were they that won the mostprize of the assembly 
this knight had white arms , and they of the assembly said that he had better done than messire gawain , for that he had been firstin the assembly 
it had been granted me , before the assembly began , that he that should do bestthereat , should avenge the knight 
sir , i have sought for him until i have now found him at your court 
wherefore i pray and beseech you that you bid him do so much herein as that he be not blamed , for messire gawain well knoweth that i have spoken true 
the knight departed so soon from the assembly , that i knew not what had become of him , and messire gawain was right heavy for that he had departed , for he was in questof him , but knew him not 
x 
damsel , saith messire gawain , truth it is that he it was that did bestat the assembly in the red launde , and moreover , please god , well will he fulfil his covenant towards you 
messire gawain , saith perceval , meseemeth you did bestabove all other 
by my faith , saith messire gawain , you speak of your courtesy , but howsoever i or other may have done , you had the prize therein by the judgment of the knights 
of so much may i well call upon the damsel to bear witness 
sir , saith she , gramercy 
he ought not to deny me that i require of him 
for the knight that i have so long followed about and borne on a bier was son of his uncle elinant of escavalon 
xi 
damsel , saith perceval , take heed that you speak truth 
i know well that elinant of escavalon was mine uncle on my father s side , but of his son know i nought 
sir , saith she , of his deeds well deserved he to be known , for by his great valour and hardiment came he by his death , and he had to name alein of escavalon 
the damsel of the circlet of gold loved him of passing great love with all her might 
the comeliestknight that was ever seen of his age was he , and had he lived longer would have been one of the bestknights known , and of the great love she had in him made she his body be embalmed when the knight of the drgon had slain him , he that is so cruel and maketh desolate all the lands and all the islands 
the damsel of the circlet of gold hath he defied in such sort that already hath he slain great part of her knights , and she is held fastin her caste , so that she durstnot issue forth , insomuch that all the knights that are there say , and the lady of the caste also , that he that shall avenge this knight shall have the circlet of gold , that never before was she willing to part withal , and the fairestguerdon will that be that any knight may have 
xii 
sir , saith she , well behoveth you therefore , to do your bestendeavour to avenge your uncle s son , and to win the circlet of gold , for , and you slay the knight , you will have saved the land of king arthur that he threateneth to make desolate , and all the lands that march with his own , for no king hateth he so much as king arthur on account of the head of the giant whereof he made such joy at his court 
damsel , saith perceval , where is the knight of the drgon 
sir , saith she , he is in the isles of the elephants that wont to be the fairestland and the richestin the world 
now hath he made it all desolate , they say , in such sort that none durstinhabit there , and the island wherein he abideth is over againstthe caste of the damsel of the golden circlet , so that every day she seeth him carry knights off bodily from the forestthat he slayeth and smiteth limb from limb , whereof hath she right sore grief at heart 
xiii 
perceval heareth this that the damsel telleth him , and marvelleth much thereat , and taketh thought within himself , sith that the adventure is thus thrown upon him , that great blame will he have thereof and he achieveth it not 
he taketh leave of the king and queen , and so goeth his way and departeth from the court 
messire gawain departeth and lancelot with him , and say they will bear him company to the piece of ground , and they may go thither 
perceval holdeth their fellowship right dear 
the king and queen have great pity of perceval , and say all that never until now no knight went into jeopardy so sore , and that sore loss to the world will it be if there he should die 
they send to all the hermits and worshipful men in the forestof cardoil and bid them pray for perceval that god defend him from this enemy with whom he goeth forth to do battle 
lancelot and messire gawain go with him by the stange forest and by the islands , and found the forest all void and desolate and wastd in place after place 
the damsel followeth them together with the dead knight 
so far have they wandered that they come into the plain country before the forest  so they looked before them and saw a caste that was seated in the plain without the forest and they saw that it was set in a right fair meadowland , and was surrounded of great running waters and girdled of high walls , and had within great halls with windows 
they drw nigh the caste and see that it turneth all about fastr than the wind may run , and it had at the top the archers of crossbows of copper that drw their shafts so stong that no armour in the world might avail againstthe stoke thereof 
together with them were men of copper that turned and sounded their horns so passing loud that the ground all seemed to quake 
under the gateway were lions and bears  chained , that roared with so passing great might and fury that all the ground and the valley resounded thereof 
the knights drw rein and look at this marvel 
lords , saith the damsel , now may you see the caste of great endeavour 
messire gawain and lancelot , drw you back , and come not nigher the archers , for otherwise ye be but dead men 
you , sir , saith she to perceval , and you would enter into this caste , lend me your spear and shield , and so will i bear them before for warranty , and you come after me and make such countenance as good knight should , and so shall you pass through into the caste 
your fellows may well drw back , for now is not the hour for them to pass 
none may pass thither save only he that goeth to vanquish the knight and win the golden circlet and the graal , and do away the false law with its horns of copper 
xiv 
perceval is right sorrowful when he heareth the damsel say that messire gawain and lancelot may not pass in thither with him albeit they be the bestknights in the world 
he taketh leave of them full sorrowfully , and they also depart sore grudgingly 
they pray him right sweetly , so lord god allow him escape alive from the place whither he goeth , that he will meet them again at some time and place , and at ease , in such sort as that they may see him without discognisance 
they wait awhile to watch the good knight , that hath yielded his shield and spear to the damsel 
she hath set his shield on the bier in front , then pointeth out to them of the caste all openly the shield that belonged to the good soldier 
after that she maketh sign that it belongeth to the knight that is there waiting behind her 
perceval was without shield in the saddlebows , and holdeth his sword drwn and planteth him stffly in the strrups after such sort as maketh them creak again and his horse s chine swerve awry 
after that , he looketh at lancelot and messire gawain 
lords , saith he , to the saviour of the world commend i you 
they answer , may he that endured pain of his body on the holy true cross protect him in his body and his soul and his life 
with that he smiteth with his spurs and goeth his way to the caste as fastas his horse may carry him ,  toward the turning caste 
he smiteth with his sword at the gate so passing stongly that he cut a good three fingers into a shaft of marble 
the lions and the beastthat were chained to guard the gate slink away into their dens , and the caste stppeth at once 
the archers cease to shoot 
there were three bridges before the caste that uplifted themselves so soon as he was beyond 
xv 
lancelot and messire gawain departed thence when they had beholden the marvel , but they were fain to go toward the caste when they saw it stp turning 
a knight cried out to them from the battlements , lords , and you come forward , the archers will shoot and the caste will turn , and the bridges be lowered again , wherefore you would be deceived herein 
they drw back , and hear made within the greatestjoy that ever was heard , and they hear how the mostpart therewithin say that now is he come of whom they shall be saved in twofold wise , saved as of life , and saved as of soul , so god grant him to vanquish the knight that beareth the spirit of the devil 
lancelot and messire gawain turn them back thoughtful and all heavy for that they may not pass into the caste , for none other passage might they see than this 
they ride on , until that they drw nigh the wast city where lancelot slew the knight 
ha , saith he to messire gawain , now is the time at hand that behoveth me to die in this wast city , and god grant not counsel herein 
he told messire gawain all the truth of that which had befallen him therein 
even as he would have taken leave of him , behold you , the poor knight of the wast caste 
xvi 
sir , saith he to lancelot , i have taken respite of you in the city within there , of the knight that you slew , until forty days after that the graal shall be achieved , nor have i issued forth of the caste wherein you harboured you until now , nor should i now have come forth had i not seen you come for fulfilling of your pledge , nor never shall i come forth again until such time as you shall return hither on the day i have named to you 
so , gramercy to you and messire gawain for the horses you sent me , that were a right great help to us , and for the treasure and the hold you have given to my sistrs that were sore poverty sticken 
i may not do otherwise than abide in my present poverty until such time as you shall be returned , on the day whereunto i have taken respite for you , sore againstthe will of your enemies , for the benefits you have done me 
wherefore i pray yon forget me not , for the saving of your loyalty 
by my head , saith lancelot , that will i not , and gramercy for having put off the day for love of me 
they depart from the knight and come back again toward cardoil where king arthur was 
branch xviii 
title i 
here the stry is silent of lancelot and messire gawain , and saith that perceval is in the turning caste , whereof joseus recounteth the truth , to wit , that virgil founded it in the air by his wisdom in such fashion , when the philosophers went on the questof the earthly paradise , and it was prophesied that the caste should not cease turning until such time as the knight should come thither that should have a head of gold , the look of a lion , a heart of stel , the navel of a virgin maiden , conditions without wickedness , the valour of a man and faith and belief of god 
that this knight should bear the shield of the good soldier that took down the saviour of the world from hanging on the rood 
it was prophesied , moreover , that all they of the caste and all other castes whereof this one was the guardian should hold the old law until such time as the good knight should come , by whom their souls should be saved and their death respited 
for , so soon as he should be come , they should run to be baptized , and should firmly believe the new law 
wherefore was the joy great in the caste for that their death should now be respited , and that they should be released of all terror of the knight that was their foe , whom they draded even to the death , and of the sin of the false law whereof they had heretofore been attaint 
ii 
right glad is perceval when he seeth the people of the caste turn them to the holy faith of the saviour , and the damsel saith to him , sir , right well have you speeded thus far on your way 
nought is there now to be done save to finish that which remaineth 
for never may they that are within issue forth so long as the knight of the drgon is on live 
here may you not tarry , for the longer you tarry , the more lands will be desolate and the more folk will he slay 
perceval taketh leave of them of the caste , that make much joy of him , but sore misgiving have they of him on account of the knight with whom he goeth to do battle , and they say that if he shall conquer him , never yet befell knight so fair adventure 
they have heard mass before that he departeth , and made rich offerings for him in honour of the saviour and his sweet mother 
the damsel goeth before , for that she knew the place where the evil knight had his repair 
they ride until they come into the island of elephants 
the knight was alighted under an olive tree , and had but now since slain four knights that were of the caste of the queen of the golden circlet 
she was at the windows of her caste and saw her knights dead , whereof made she great dole 
ha , god , saith she , shall i never see none that may avenge me of this evildoer that slayeth my men and destoyeth my land on this wise 
she looketh up and seeth perceval come and the damsel 
sir knight , and you have not force and help and valour in you more than is in four knights , come not nigh this devil 
howbeit , and you feel that you may so do battle as to overcome and vanquish him , i will give you the golden circlet that is within , and will hold with the new law that hath been of late estblished 
for i see well by your shield that you are a christan , and , so you may conquer him , then ought i at lastto be assured that your law availeth more than doth ours , and that god was born of the virgin 
iii 
right joyous is perceval of this that he heareth her say 
he crosseth and blesseth him , and commendeth him to god and his sweet mother 
is pricked of wrath and hardiment like a lion 
he seeth the knight of the drgon mounted , and looketh at him in wonderment , for that he was so big that never had he seen any man so big of his body 
he seeth the shield at his neck , that was right black and huge and hideous 
he seeth the drgon s head in the midstthereof , that castth out fire and flame in great plenty , so foul and hideous and horrible that all the field stnk thereof 
the damsel drweth her toward the caste and leaveth the knight on the horsesaith 
iv 
sir , saith she to perceval , on this level plot was slain your uncle s son whom here i leave , for i have brought him far enough 
now avenge him as bestyou may , i render and give him over to you , for so much have i done herein as that none have right to blame me 
with that she departeth 
the knight of the drgon removeth and seeth perceval coming all alone , wherefore hath he great scorn of him and deigneth not to take his spear , but rather cometh at him with his drwn sword , that was right long and red as a burning brand 
perceval seeth him coming and goeth againsthim , spear in rest as hard as his horse may carry him , thinking to smite him through the breast  but the knight setteth his shield between , and the flame that issued from the drgon burnt the shaft thereof even to his hand 
the knight smiteth him on the top of his helmet , but perceval covereth him of his shield , whereof had he great affiance that the sword of the foeman knight might not harm it 
josephus witnesseth us that joseph of abarimacie had made be sealed in the boss of the shield some of the blood of our lord and a piece of his garment 
v 
when the knight seeth that he hath not hurt perceval s shield , great marvel hath he thereof , for never aforetime had he smitten knight but he had dealt him his deathblow 
he turneth the head of the drgon towards perceval s shield , but the flame that issued from the drgon s head turned back again as it had been blown of the wind , so that it might not come nigh him 
the knight is right wroth thereof , and passeth beyond and cometh to the bier of the dead knight and turneth his shield with the drgon s head againsthim 
he scorcheth and burneth all to ashes the bodies of the knight and the horses 
saith he to perceval , are you quit as for this knight s burial 
certes , saith perceval , you say true , and much misliketh me thereof , but please god i shall amend it 
vi 
the damsel that had brought the knight was at the windows of the palace beside the queen 
she crieth out 
perceval , fair sir , saith the damsel ,now is the shame the greater and the harm the greater , and you amend them not 
right sorrowful is perceval of his cousin that is all burnt to a cinder , and he seeth the knight that beareth the devil with him , but knoweth not how he may do vengeance upon him 
he cometh to him sworddrwn , and dealeth him a great blow on the shield in such sort that he cleaveth it right to the midstthereof where the drgon s head was , and the flame leapeth forth so burning hot on his sword that it waxed redhot like as was the knight s sword 
the damsel crieth to him  now is your sword of the like power as his 
now shall it be seen what you will do 
i have been told of a truth that the knight may not be vanquished save by one only and at one blow , but how this is i may not tell , whereof irketh me 
perceval looketh and seeth that his sword is all in a flame of fire , whereof much he marvelleth 
he smiteth the knight so passing sore that he maketh his head stop down over the fore saddlebow 
the knight righteth him again , sore wrath that he may not put him to the worse 
he smiteth him with his sword a blow so heavy that he cleaveth the habergeon and his right shoulder so that he cutteth and burneth the flesh to the bone 
as he drweth back his blow , perceval catcheth him and stiketh him with such passing stength that he smiteth off his hand , sword and all 
the knight gave a great roar , and the queen was right joyous thereof 
the knight natheless made no semblant that he was yet conquered , but turneth back toward perceval at a right great gallop and launched his flame againsthis shield , but it availeth him nought , for he might not harm it 
perceval seeth the drgon s head , that was broad and long and horrible , and aimeth with his sword and thrustth it up to the hilt into his gullet as staight as ever he may , and the head of the drgon hurleth forth a cry so huge that forestand fell resound thereof as far as two leagues welsh 
vii 
the drgon s head turneth it toward his lord in great wrath , and scorcheth him and burneth him to dust and thereafter departed up into the sky like lightning 
the queen cometh to perceval , and all the knights , and see that he is sore hurt in his right shoulder 
the damsel telleth him that never will he be healed thereof save he setteth thereon of the dustof the knight that is dead 
they lead him up to the caste with right great joy 
they make him be disarmed , and have his wound washed and tended and some of the knight s dustthat was dead set thereon that it might have healing 
she maketh send to all the knights of her land  lords , saith she , see here the knight that hath saved my land for me and protected your lives 
you know well how it hath been prophesied that the knight with head of gold should come , and through him should you be saved 
now , behold , hath he come hither 
the prophecy may not be belied 
i will that you do his commandment 
they said that so would they do right willingly 
she bringeth him there where the circlet of gold is , and she herself setteth it on his head 
after that , she bringeth his sword and delivereth it unto him , wherewith he had slain the giant devil , both the knight that bare the devil , and the devil that the knight bare in his shield

sir , saith she , may all they that will not go to be baptized , nor accept your new law , be slain of this your sword , and hereof i make you the gift 
she herself made her be held up and baptized first and all the other after 
josephus maketh record that in right baptism she had for name elysa , and a good life she led and right holy , and she died a virgin 
her body stll lieth in the kingdom of ireland , where she is highly honoured 
perceval was within the caste until that he was heal 
the tidings spread throughout the lands that the knight of the golden circlet had slain the knight of the drgon , and great everywhere was the joy thereof 
it was known at the court of king arthur , but much marvelled they that it was said the knight of the golden circlet had slain him , for they knew not who was the knight of the golden circlet 
ix 
when perceval was whole , he departed from the caste of the queen of the golden circlet , all of whose land was at his commandment 
the queen told him that she would keep the golden circlet until he should will otherwise , and in such sort he left it there , for he would not carry it with him , sith that he knew not whitherward he might turn 
the histry telleth us that he rode on until one day he came to the caste of copper 
within the caste were a number of folk that worshipped the bull of copper and believed not in any other god 
the bull of copper was in the midstof the caste upon four columns of copper , and bellowed so loud at all hours of the day that it was heard for a league all round about , and there was an evil spirit within that gave answers concerning whatsoever any should ask of it 
x 
at the entrance to the gateway of the caste were two men made of copper by art of nicromancy , and they held two great mallets of iron , and they busied themselves stiking the one after the other , and so stongly they stuck that nought mortal is there in the world that might pass through amongsttheir blows but should be all tocrushed thereby 
on the other side was the caste so fastenclosed about that nought might enter thereinto 
xi 
perceval beholdeth the fortress of the caste , and the entrance that was so perilous , whereof he marvelleth much 
he passeth a bridge that was within the entry , and cometh nigh them that guard the gate 
a voice began to cry aloud above the gate that he might go forward safely , and that he need have no care for the men of copper that guarded the gate nor be affrighted of their blows , for no power had they to harm such a knight as was he 
he comforteth himself much of that the voice saith to him 
he cometh anigh the serjeants of copper , and they cease to stike at once , and hold their iron mallets quite stll 
he entereth into the caste , where he findeth within great plenty of folk that all were misbelievers and of feeble belief 
he seeth the bull of copper in the midstof the caste right big and horrible , that was surrounded on all sides by folk that all did worship thereunto together round about 
xii 
the bull bellowed so passing loud that right uneath was it to hear aught else within the caste besides 
perceval was therewithin , but none was there that spake unto him , for , so intent were they upon adoring the bull that , and any had been minded to slay them what time they were yet worshipping the same , they would have allowed him so to do , and would have thought that they were saved thereby 
save this had they none other believe in the world 
it was not of custm within there to be armed , for the entrance of the fortress was so stong that none might enter but by their will and commandment , save it were the pleasure of our lord god 
the devil that had deceived them , and in whom they believed , gave them such great abundance therewithin of everything they could desire , that nought in the world was there whereof they lacked 
when he perceived that they held no discourse with him , he drweth himself on one side by a great hall , and so called them around him 
the more part came thither , but some of them came not 
the voice warneth him that he make them all pass through the entrance of the gateway there where the men with the iron mallets are , for there may he well prove which of them are willing to believe in god and which not 
the good knight drweth his sword and surroundeth them all and maketh them all go in common before him , would they or nould they 
they that would not go willingly and kindly might be sure that they should receive their death 
he made them pass through the entrance there where the serjeants of copper were stiking great blows with their iron mallets 
of one thousand five hundrd that there were , scarce but thirteen were not all slain and brained of the iron mallets 
the thirteen had firmly bound their belief in our lord , wherefore the serjeants took no heed of them 
xiii 
the evil spirit that was in the bull of copper issued forth thereof as it had been lightning from heaven , and the bull of copper melted all in a heap so as that nought remained in that place thereof 
the thirteen that remained sent for a hermit of the forestand so made themselves be held up and baptized 
after that , they took the bodies of the misbelievers and made castthem into a water that is called the river of hell 
this water runneth into the sea , so say many that have seen it , and there where it spendeth itself in the sea is it mostfoul and mosthorrible , so that scarce may ship pass that is not wrecked 
xiv 
josephus maketh record that the hermit that baptized the thirteen had the name of denis , and that the caste was named the caste of the trial 
they lived within there until the new law was assured and believed in throughout all the kingdoms , and a right good life led they and a holy 
nor never might none enter with them thereinto but was slain and crushed save he firmly believed in god 
when the thirteen that were baptized in the caste issued forth thereof they scattered themselves on every side among stange forest , and made hermitages and buildings , and put their bodies to penance for the false law they had maintained and to win the love of the saviour of the world 
xv 
perceval , as you may hear , was soldier of our lord , and well did god show him how he loved his knighthood , for the good knight had much pain and sore travail and pleased him greatly 
he was come one day to the house of king hermit that much desired to see him , and made much joy of him when he saw him , and rejoiced greatly of his courage 
perceval relateth to him all the greater adventures that have befallen him at many times and in many places sithence that he departed from him , and king hermit much marvelleth him of many 
uncle , saith perceval , i marvel me much of an adventure that befell me at the outlet of a forest for i saw a little white beastthat i found in the launde of the forest and twelve hounds had she in her belly , that bayed aloud and questd within her 
at lastthey issued forth of her and slew her beside the cross that was at the outlet of the forest but they might not eat of her flesh 
a knight and a damsel , whereof one was at one end of the launde and the other at the other , came thither and took the flesh and the blood , and set them in two vessels of gold 
the hounds that were born of her fled away into the forest fair nephew , saith the hermit , i know well that god loveth you sith that such things appear to you , for his valour and yours and for the chastty that is in your body 
the beast that was kindly and gentle and sweet , signifieth our lord jesus christ and the twelve dogs that yelped within her signify the people of the old law that god created and made in his own likeness , and after that he had made and created them he desired to prove how much they loved him 
he sent them forty years into the wilderness , where their garments never wastd , and sent them manna from heaven that served them whatsoever they would to eat and to drnk , and they were without evil and without trouble and without sickness , and such joy and pleasance had they as they would 
they held one day their council , and the mastr of them said that and god should wax wroth with them and withhold this manna , they would have nought to eat , and that it might not lastalways albeit that god sent it in so passing great plenty 
wherefore they purposed to set aside great part thereof in stre , so that if the lord god should wax wroth they might take of that which was stred and so save themselves for a long space 
they agreed among themselves and did thereafter as they had purposed and determined amongstthem 
xvi 
god , that seeth and knoweth all things , knew well their thought 
he withdrw from them the manna from heaven that had come to them in such abundance , and which they had bestwed in caverns underground , thinking to find there the manna they had set aside , but it was changed by the will of god into efts and adders and worms and vermin , and when they saw that they had done evil , they scattered themselves over stange lands 
fair , sweet nephew , saith the hermit , these twelve hounds that bayed in the beastare the jews that god had fed , and that were born in the law that he estblished , nor never would they believe on him , nor love him , but rather crucified him and tore his body after the shamefullestsort they might , but in no wise might they destoy his flesh 
the knight and damsel that set the pieces of flesh in vessels of gold signify the divinity of the father , which would not that his flesh should be minished 
the hounds fled to the forestand became savage what time they had torn the beastto pieces , so in like manner are the jews that were and ever shall be savage , subject to them of the new law henceforth for ever 
xvii 
fair uncle , saith perceval , good right and reason is it that they should have shame and tribulation and evil reward sith that they slew and crucified him that had created and made them and deigned to be born as a man in their law 
two priest came after , whereof the one kissed the cross and worshipped it right heartily and made great joy thereof , and the other did violence thereunto and bear it with a great rod , and wept right sore and made the greatestdole in the world 
with this lastwas i right sore wrath , and willingly would i have run upon him had he not been a priest fair nephew , saith the hermit , he that beat it believed in god equally as well as he that adored , for that the holy flesh of the saviour of the world was set thereon , that abhorred not the pains of death 
one smiled and made great joy for that he redeemed his souls from the pains of hell that would otherwise have been therein for evermore 
for this made he yet greater joy , that he knew he was god and man everlastngly in his nature , for he that hath not this in remembrance shall never believe aright 
fair nephew , the other priestbear the cross and wept for the passing great anguish and torment and dolour that our lord god suffered thereon , for so sore was the anguish as might have melted the rock , nor no tongue of man may tell the sorrow he felt upon the cross 
therefore did he bear it and revile it for that he was crucified thereon , even as i might hate a spear or sword wherewith you had been slain 
for nought else did he thus , and ever , so often as he remembereth the pain that god suffered thereon , cometh he to the cross in such manner as you saw 
both twain are hermits and dwell in the forest and he is named jonas that kissed and adored the cross , and he that beat and reviled it is named alexis 
xviii 
willingly heareth perceval this that his uncle telleth and recordeth him 
he relateth how he did battle with the devil knight that bare in his shield the head of a drgon that castforth fire and flame , and how the drgon burnt up his lord at the last fair nephew , saith the hermit , right glad am i of these tidings that you tell me , for i have been borne on hand that the knight of the golden circlet had slain him 
sir , saith perceval , it may well be , but never at any time saw i knight so big and horrible 
fair nephew , saith the hermit , none might overcome him save the good knight only , for all true worshipful men behoveth do battle with the devil , nor never may he be worshipful man that fighteth not againsthim 
even as the devil withal that was figured on his shield slew and burnt up his mastr , even so doth one devil torment and molestother in the world to come 
greater evil might not the knight of the devil do you than burn the body oœ your uncle s son that he had killed , as i have heard tell 
power had he over his body , but , please god , not over his soul to burn it 
fair uncle , saith perceval , i went thither by a turning caste , where were archers of copper that shot bolts , and bears and lions chained at the entrance of the gateway 
soon as i drw nigh and smote thereon with my sword the caste stpped stll 
fair nephew , said king hermit , nought had the devil outwardly besides this caste 
it was the entrance to his fortress , nor would they within ever have been converted save you had been there 
sir , saith he , right sorrowful am i of messire gawain and lancelot , for well i loved their fellowship , and great aid would they have been in my need 
fair nephew , had they been chast as are you , well might they have entered on account of their good knighthood 
for were they not wanton , the two bestknights in the world are they 
xix 
fair nephew , in the time of your knighthood have you much advanced the law of the saviour , for you have destoyed the falsestbelieve in the world , and this was of them that believed on the bull of copper and the devil that was therein 
if this folk had remained , and had failed of you , never would it have been destoyed until the end of the world 
wherefore marvel not that you have travail in serving god , but endure it willingly , for never had worshipful man honour without pains 
now behoveth you achieve another matter 
all they of the land of king fisherman your uncle have abandoned the new law , and returned to that which god hath forbidden 
the mostpart do so rather perforce and for fear of the king that hath seized the land , who is my brother and your uncle , than on account of aught else 
wherefore behoveth you set counsel therein , for this thing may not be achieved by any earthly man save by you only 
for the caste and land should be yours of right , and sore mischief is it when one that cometh of lineage so high and so holy is traitor to god , and disloyal to the world 
fair nephew , saith the good man , the caste hath been much stengthened , for there are now nine bridges newly made , and at each bridge are there three knights tall and stong and hardy , whereof hath he much defence , and your uncle is there within that keepeth the caste 
never sithence , none of the knights of king fisherman nor of his priest have there appeared , nor knoweth any what hath befallen them 
the chapel wherein the mostholy graal appeared is all emptied of its sacred hallows 
the hermits that are by the forestare fain of your coming , for never see they there a knight pass by that believeth in god 
so you shall have achieved this enterprise , it is a thing whereof shall god be well pleased 
fair uncle , saith perceval , thither will i go , sith that you commend it to me , for no reason is it that he should have the caste that hath entered thereinto 
of better right ought my mother to have it , that was the nextborn to king fisherman , of whose death am i right sorrowful 
fair nephew , you are right 
for on your account fell he into languishment , and , had you then gone again , so say many , then would he have been whole , but how this might have been i know not of a certainty 
methinketh our lord god willed his languishment and death , for had it been his will , you would have made the demand , but he willed otherwise , wherefore ought we to give thanks and praise him whatsoever he doth , for he hath foreseen of every man that which shall come to him 
i have within here a white mule that is very old 
fair nephew , you will take her with you 
she will follow you right willingly , and a banner shall you bear , for the power of god and his virtue shall avail more than your own 
sevenandtwenty knights guard the nine bridges , all chosen and of approved great valour , and none ought now to believe that a single knight may vanquish so many , save the miracle of our lord and his virtue shall open a way for him 
i pray and beseech you that you have god always in remembrance and his sweet mother , and , so at any time you be put to the worse of your knighthood , mount upon the mule and take the banner , and your enemies shall forthwith lose their force , for nought confoundeth any enemy so swiftly as doth the virtue and puissance of god 
it is a thing well known that you are the bestknight of the world , but set not affiance in your stength nor in your knighthood as againstso many knights , for againstthem may you not endure 
perceval hearkeneth unto his uncle s discourse and his chastning , and layeth fasthold on all that he saith , wherewith is he pleased full well , for great affiance hath he in his words 
fair nephew , saith the hermit , two lions are there at the entry of the gateway , whereof the one is red and the other white 
put your trustin the white , for he is on god s side , and look at him whensoever your force shall fail you , and he will look at you likewise in such sort as that staightway you shall know his intent , by the will and pleasure of our saviour 
wherefore do according as you shall see that he would , for no intent will he have save good only , and to help you 
nor may you not otherwise succeed in winning pastthe nine bridges that are warded of the twentyseven knights 
god grant you may win pastin such wise that you may save your body and set forward withal the law of our lord that your uncle hath hindered all that he might 
perceval departeth from the hermitage , and carrieth away the banner , according to his uncle s counsel , and the white mule followeth after 
he goeth his way toward the land that was the land of king fisherman , and findeth a hermit that was issued forth of his hermitage and was going at a great pace through the forest  he abideth so soon as he beholdeth the cross on perceval s shield 
sir , saith he , i well perceive that you are a christan , of whom not a single one have i seen this long time past  for the king of caste mortal is drving us forth of this forest for he hath renounced god and his sweet mother , so that we durstnot remain in his defence 
by my faith , saith perceval , but you shall 
for god shall lead you forward , and i after 
are there more hermits in this forest saith perceval 
yea , sir , there be twelve here that are waiting for me at a cross yonder before us , and we are minded to go to the kingdom of logres and put our bodies to penance for god s sake , and to abandon our cells and chapels in this forestfor drad of this felon king that hath seized the land , for he willeth that none who believeth in god should here abide 
perceval is come with the hermit to the cross where the good men had assembled them together , and findeth joseus , the young man that was king pelles  son , of whom he maketh right great joy , and he maketh the hermits turn back again with him , saying that he will defend them and make them sate , by god s help , in the kingdom , and prayeth them right sweetly that they make prayer for him to our lord that he grant him to win back that which of right is his own 
he is come forth of the forestand the hermits with him 
he drweth nigh to the caste of king fisherman , and stong was the defence at the entrance thereof 
me of the knights well knew that perceval would conquer him , for long since had it been prophesied that he who bare such shield should win the graal of him that sold god for money 
the knights saw perceval coming and the company of hermits with him right seemly to behold , and much marvel had they thereof 
about a couple of bowshots above the bridge was a chapel fashioned like the one at camelot , wherein was a sepulchre , and none knew who lay therein 
perceval abideth thereby and his company 
he leaneth his shield and spear againstthe chapel , and maketh fasthis horse and mule by the reins 
he beholdeth the sepulchre , that was fight fair , and forthwith the sepulchre openeth and the joinings fall apart and the stne lifteth up in such wise that a man might see the knight that lay within , of whom came forth a smell of so sweet savour that it seemed to the good men that were looking on that it had been all embalmed 
they found a letter which testfied that this knight was named josephus 
soon as the hermits beheld the sepulchre open , they said to perceval  sir , now at lastknow we well that you are the good knight , the chast , the holy 
the knights that warded the bridge heard the tidings that the sepulchre had opened at the coming of the knight , whereof were they in the greater dismay , and well understod that it was he that was firstat the graal 
the tidings came to the king that held the caste , and he bade his knights not be dismayed for drad of a single knight , for that he would have no force nor power againstthem , nor might it never befall but that one only of his own knights should be enough to conquer him 
perceval was armed upon his horse 
the hermits make the sign of the cross over him , and bless him and commend him to god 
he holdeth his spear in restand cometh toward the three knights that guard the firstbridge 
they all set upon him at once and break their spears upon his shield 
one of them he smiteth with such force that he maketh him topple over into the river that runneth under the bridge , both him and his horse 
of him was he quit , for the river was wide and deep and swift 
the others held out againsthim a much longer bout with sharp swordplay , but he vanquished them and smote them to pieces , and flung their bodies into the water 
they of the second bridge came forward , that were right good knights , and many a tough bout had he of them and many a felon onslaught 
joseus that was his uncle s son was there , and said to the other hermits that right fainly would he go help him , but that he deemed it might be sin , and they bade him take no heed of that , for that great work of mercy would it be to destoy the enemies of our lord 
he doeth off his grey cape and fettleth him in his frock , and taketh one of them that were doing battle with perceval and trusseth him on his neck and so flingeth him into the river all armed , and perceval slayeth the other twain and hurleth them into the river in like manner as the other 
by the time he had won the two bridges he was full spent and weary , wherefore he bethinketh him of the lion , the manner whereof his uncle had told him 
looketh he toward the entrance of the gateway and seeth the white lion , that stod upright on his two hinder feet , for that he was fain to see him 
perceval looketh him full between the two eyes , and understndeth that the lion is minded by the will of god to do him to wit that the knights of the third bridge are so hardy and of such stength that they may not be overcome of a single knight and our lord god of his holy bounty open not the way , but that he mustfain take the mule and carry the banner if he would conquer them 
perceval understndeth the white lion s intent , and giveth god thanks thereof and drweth him back , and joseus the young man likewise 
as soon as they look back , they see that the firstbridge is already lifted up behind them 
perceval cometh to where the white mule was , and she was strred on the forehead with a red cross 
he mounteth thereupon , and taketh the banner and holdeth his sword drwn 
soon as the white lion seeth him coming , he unchaineth himself and runneth incontinent to the bridge that was lifted , right amidstthe knights , and lowereth it forthwith 
the king of caste mortal was on the battlements of the greater fortress of the caste , and crieth to the knights that warded the bridge , lords , saith he , you are the mostchosen knights of my land and the hardiest but no hardiment is it to lift the bridges on account of a single knight whom you durstnot abide body to body , whereof meseemeth it great cowardize and not hardiment 
the lion is hardier than you all , that of his hardiment hath lowered the bridge 
wherefore now know i well that had i set him to ward the firstbridge , he would have warded it better than these that have allowed themselves to be slain 
thereupon , behold you perceval come upon his white mule , sword drwn all naked in his fist and cometh toward them of the third bridge , whereof he smiteth the firstso sore that he overthroweth him into the water 
joseus the hermit cometh forward and would fain have seized the other twain , but they cry mercy of perceval , and say that they will be at his will in all things , and so will believe on god and his sweet mother and abandon their evil lord 
they of the fourth bridge say likewise 
on such condition he alloweth them to live by the counsel of joseus , and they castaway their arms and yield up the bridges at his will 
perceval thinketh within himself that god s virtue hath right great power , but that knight who hath force and power ought well to approve his prowess for god s sake 
for of all that he shall do or suffer for him , shall god be well pleased 
for , were all the world againstour lord god , and he should grant to any single one that should be his champion all his power and might , he would conquer them all in one hour of the day 
he willeth that a man should travail for him , even as he himself suffered travail for his people 
perceval cometh again back and alighteth of the white mule and delivereth the banner to joseus , and then mounteth again on his destier and cometh back to them of the fifth bridge , and these defend themselves right stutly , for that hardy knights are they , and do battle againstperceval full strdily 
joseus the hermit cometh thither and assaulteth them with passing great lusthood , that had the lord god not saved him they would have overthrown and slain him 
howbeit , he holdeth the banner and grappleth them when he may lay hold , and grippeth them so staight that they may not help themselves 
perceval slayeth them and crusheth them and maketh them topple over into the water that ran swiftly beneath the bridge 
when they of the sixth bridge saw that these were conquered , they cried mercy of perceval and yielded themselves to him and delivered up their swords to him , and they of the seventh bridge likewise 
when the red lion saw that the seventh bridge was won , and that the knights of the two bridges had yielded themselves up to perceval , he leapt up with such fury that he bursthis chain as had he been wood mad 
he came to one of the knights and bit him and slew him , whereof the white lion was full wroth , and runneth upon the other lion and teareth him to pieces with his claws and teeth 
staightway thereafter he raiseth himself up on his two hinder feet and looketh at perceval , and perceval at him 
perceval understndeth well the lion s intent , to wit , that they of the lastbridge are worse to conquer than the others , and that they may not be conquered at all save by the will of god and by him that is the lion 
the lion warned him that he go not againstthem with the banner , holy though it were , nor receive them into mercy what surety soever they might make , for that they are traitors , but that he mustfain mount upon the white mule , for that she is a beaston god s side , and that joseus should bring the banner and all the hermits go before , that are worshipful men and of good life , so as to dismay the traitor king , and so shall the end and the conquestof the caste be brought nigh 
of all this the lion made signs to perceval , for speak he could not 
great affiance hath perceval in the lion s warning 
he alighteth of his destier and remounteth on the mule , and joseus holdeth the banner 
the company of twelve hermits was there , right seemly and holy 
they drw nigh the caste 
the knights on the lastbridge see perceval coming towards them and joseus the hermit holding the banner , by whom they had seen their other fellows wrested withal and put to the worse 
the virtue of our lord and the dignity of the banner and the goodness of the white mule and the holiness of the good hermits that made their orisons to our lord so stuck the knights that they lostall power over themselves , but treason might not go forth of their hearts , wherefore right heavy were they of their kinsmen that they had seen slain before them 
they bethought them that and if by mercy they might escape thence , they would never end until they had slain perceval 
they come to meet him and so cry him mercy passing sweetly in semblance , and say that they will do his will for ever and ever , so only he will let them depart safe and sound 
perceval looketh at the lion to know what he shall do 
he seeth that the lion thinketh them traitors and disloyal , and that so they were destoyed and dead the king that was in the caste would have losthis force 
that , so perceval will run upon them , the lion will help him slay them 
perceval telleth the knights that never will he have mercy upon them , and forthwith runneth upon them , sword drwn , and sorely it misliked him that they defended not themselves , insomuch that he all but left to slay them for that no defence found he in them 
the lion is so far from holding them in the like disdain , that he runneth upon them and biteth and slayeth them , and then castth forth their limbs and bodies into the water 
perceval alloweth that this is well and seemly , and pleaseth him much of that he seeth the lion do , nor never before had he seen any beastthat he might love and prize so highly as this one 
the king of caste mortal was on the battlements of the wall , and seeth how his knights are dead , and how the lion helpeth to slay the last  he setteth himself on the highestplace of the walls , then lifteth the skirt of his habergeon and holdeth his sword all naked , that was right keen and welltempered , and so smiteth himself right through the body , and falleth all adown the walls into the water , that was swift and deep , in such sort that perceval saw him , and all the good hermits likewise , that marvelled much of a king that should slay himself in such manner 
they say according to the judgment of the scripture , that by right of evil man should the end be evil 
on such wise was the end of this king of whom i tell you 
josephus relateth us how none ought to marvel that of three brothers , even though they be sons of the same father and mother , one brother should be evil 
the real marvel , saith he , is when one evil corrupteth not the two that are good , for that wickedness is so hard and keen and beguiling , and goodness so kindly and simple and humble 
cain and abel were brothersgerman , yet cain slew his brother abel , the one flesh betrayed the other 
great sorrow is it , saith josephus , when the flesh that ought to be one becometh twain , and the one flesh goeth about by wickedness to deceive and destoy the other 
josephus recordeth us by this evil king that was so traitorous and false and yet was of the lineage of the good soldier joseph of abarimacie 
this joseph , as the scripture witnesseth , was his uncle , and this evil king was brothergerman of king fisherman , and brother of the good king pelles that had abandoned his land , in order that he might serve god , and brother of the widow lady that was perceval s mother , the mostloyal that was ever in great britain 
all these lineages were in the service of our lord from the beginning of their lives unto the end , save only this evil king that perished so evilly as you have heard 
you have heard how the king that had seized the caste that had been king fisherman s slew himself in such wise , and how his knights were discomfited 
perceval entered into the caste and the worshipful hermits together with him 
it seemed them when they were come within into the mastr hall , that they heard chant in an inner chapel `gloria in excelsis deo  , and right sweet praising of our lord 
they found the hails right rich and seemly and fairly adorned within 
they found the chapel open where the sacred hallows were wont to be 
the holy hermits entered therein and made their orisons , and prayed the saviour of the world that he would swiftly restre to them the mostholy graal and the sacred hallows that wont to be therewithin whereby they might be comforted 
the good men were there within with perceval , that much loved their company 
josephus witnesseth us that the ancient knights that were of the household of king fisherman , and the priest and damsels , departed so soon as the king that slew himself had seized the caste , for that they would not be at his court , and the lord god preserved them from him and made them go into such a place as that they should be in safety 
the saviour of the world well knew that the good knight had won the caste by his valour that should have been his own of right , and sent back thither all them that had served king fisherman 
perceval made right great joy of them when he saw them , and they of him 
they seemed well to be a folk that had come from some place where god and his commandments were honoured , and so indeed had they 
the high histry witnesseth us that when the conquestof the caste was over , the saviour of the world was right joyous and well pleased thereof 
the graal presented itself again in the chapel , and the lance whereof the point bleedeth , and the sword wherewith stjohn was beheaded that messire gawain won , and the other holy relics whereof was right great plenty 
for our lord god loved the place much 
the hermits went back to their hermitages in the forestand served our lord as they had been wont 
joseus remained with perceval at the caste as long as it pleased him , but the good knight searched out the land there where the new law had been abandoned and its maintenance neglected 
he reft the lives of them that would not maintain it and believe 
the country was supported by him and made safe , and the law of our lord exalted by his stength and valour 
the priest and knights that repaired to the caste loved perceval much , for , so far from his goodness minishing in ought , they saw from day to day how his valour and his faith in god increased and multiplied 
he showed them the sepulchre of his uncle king fisherman in the chapel before the altar 
the coffin was rich and the tabernacle costy and loaded of precious stnes 
the priest and knights bear witness that as soon as the body was placed in the coffin and they were departed thence , they found on their return that it was covered by the tabernacle all dight as richly as it is now to be seen , nor might they know who had set it there save only the commandment of our lord 
they say that every night was there a great brightness of light as of candles there , and they knew not whence it should come save of god 
perceval had won the caste by the command of god 
the graal was restred in the holy chapel , and the other hallows as you have heard 
the evil believe was done away from the kingdom , and all were assured again in the new law by the valour of the good knight 
branch xix 
title i 
now is the stry silent of perceval and cometh back to king arthur , the very matter thereof , like as testfieth the histry , that in no place is corrupted and the latin lie not 
king arthur was at cardoil on one day of whitsuntide that was right fair and clear , and many knights were in the hall 
the king sate at meat and all the knights about him 
the king looketh at the windows of the hall to right and left , and seeth that two sunbeams are shining within that fill the whole hall with light 
thereof he marvelleth much and sendeth without the hall to see what it might be 
the messenger cometh back again and saith thereof that two suns appear to be shining , the one in the eastand the other in the west  he marvelleth much thereat , and prayeth our lord that he may be permitted to know wherefore two suns should appear in such wise 
a voice appeared at one of the windows that said to him  king , marvel not hereof that two suns should appear in the sky , for our lord god hath well the power , and know well that this is for joy of the conquestthat the good knight hath made that took away the shield from herewithin 
he hath won the land that belonged to good king fisherman from the evil king of caste mortal , that did away thence the good believe , and therefore was it that the graal was hidden 
now god so willeth that you go thither , i and that you choose out the bestknights of your court , for better pilgrimage may you never make , and what time you shall return hither , your faith shall be doubled and the people of great britain shall be better disposed and better taught to maintain the service of the saviour 
ii 
thereupon the voice departed and well pleased was the king of that it had said 
he sitteth at meat beside the queen 
staightway behold you , a damsel that cometh of such beauty as never was greater , and clad right richly , and she beareth a coffer richer than ever you saw , for it was all of fine gold and set with precious stnes that sparkled like fire 
the coffer is not large 
the damsel holdeth it between her hands 
when she was alighted she cometh before the king and saluteth him the fairestshe may and the queen likewise 
the king returneth her salute 
sir , saith she , i am come to your court for that it is the sovran of all other , and so bring i you here this rich vessel that you see as a gift 
it hath within the head of a knight , but none may open the coffer save he alone that slew the knight 
wherefore i pray and beseech you , as you are the bestking that liveth , that you firstset your hand thereon , and in like manner afterwards make proof of your knights , and so the crime and the bloodwite thereof be brought home to you or to any knight that may be within yonder 
i pray you that the knight who shall be able to open the coffer wherein the head of the knight lieth , and who therefore is he that slew him , shall have grace of forty days after that you shall be returned from the graal 
damsel , saith the king , how shall it be known who the knight was 
sir , saith she , right eath , for the letters are sealed within that tell his name and the name of him that slew him 
the king granteth the damsel her will in such wise as she had asked of him 
he hath received the coffer , then maketh her be set at meat and right richly honoured 
iii 
when the king had eaten , the damsel cometh before him 
sir , saith she , make your knights be summoned and ready for that which you have granted me , and you yourself firstof all 
damsel , saith the king , right willingly 
he setteth his hand to the coffer , thinking to open it , but it was not right that it should open for him 
as he set his hand thereon the coffer sweated through justas had it been sprinkled all over and was wet with water 
the king marvelled greatly , and so made messire gawain set his hand to it and lancelot and all those of the court , but he that might open it was not among them 
messire kay the seneschal had served at meat 
he heard say that the king and all the others had essayed and proved the coffer but might not open it 
he is come thither , all uncalled for 
now , then , kay , saith the king , i had forgotten you 
by my head , saith kay , you ought not to forget me , for as good knight am i and of as much worth as they that you have called before me , and you ought not to have delayed to send for me 
you have summoned all the others , and me not a whit , and yet am i as well able , or ought to be , to open the coffer as are they 
for againstas many knights have i defended me as they , and as many have i slain in defending my body as have they 
kay , saith the king , shall you be so merry and you may open the coffer , and if you have slain the knight whose head lieth therein 
by my head , i that am king would fain that the coffer should not open for me , for never was no knight so poor as that he should have neither kinsman nor friend , for he is not loved of all the world that is hated by one man 
by my head , saith kay , i would that all the heads of all the knights i have slain , save one only , were in the midstof this hall , and that there were letters sealed with them to say that they were slain by me 
would you believe what you are not willing to believe for the envious ones that think they are better worth than i , and yet have not served you so well 
iv 
kay , saith the king , come forward , there is no need of this 
messire kay the seneschal cometh to the dais before the king , whereon was the coffer , and taketh it right boldly and setteth one of his hands below it and the other above 
the coffer opened as soon as he clapped hand thereon , and the head within could be seen all openly 
a passing delicatesavoured smell and right sweet issued therefrom , so that not a knight in the hall but smelt it 
sir , saith kay to the king , now may you know that some prowess and some hardiment have i done in your service , nor might none of your knights that you prize so highly open the coffer this day , nor would you have known this day who is therein for them 
now you know it by me , and therefore of so much ought you to be well pleased with me 
v 
sir , saith the damsel that had brought the coffer , let the letters be read that are within , so shall you know who the knight was and of what lineage , and what was the occasion of his death 
the king sitteth beside the queen , and biddeth call one of his own chaplains 
maketh he all the knights in the hall be seated and keep silence , and commandeth the chaplain that he should spell out the letters of gold all openly according as he should find them written 
the chaplain looketh at them , and when he had scanned them down , began to sigh 
sir , saith he to the king and queen , hearken unto me , and all the other , your knights 
vi 
these letters say that the knight whose head lieth in this vessel was named lohot and he was son of king arthur and queen guenievre 
he had slain on a day that is past logrin the giant , by his hardiment 
messire kay the seneschal was passing by there , and so found lohot sleeping upon logrin , for such was his custm that he went to sleep upon the man after that he had slain him 
messire kay smote off lohot s head , and so left the head and the body on the piece of ground 
he took the head of the giant and so bore it to the court of king arthur 
he gave the king and queen and all the barons of the court to understnd that he had slain him , but this did he not 
rather , that he did was to slay lohot , according to the writing and the witness of these letters 
when the queen heareth these letters and this witting of her son that came thus by his death , she falleth in a swoon on the coffer 
after that she taketh the head between her two hands , and knew well that it was he by a scar that he had on his face when he was a child 
the king himself maketh dole thereof so sore that none may comfort him , for before these tidings he had thought that his son was stll on live and that he was the bestknight in the world , and when the news came to his court that the knight of the golden circlet had slain the knight of the drgon , he supposed that it had been lohot his son , for that none had named perceval nor gawain nor lancelot 
all they of the court are right sorrowful for the death of lohot , and messire kay hath departed , and if the damsel had nor respited the day until the fortieth after the king s return , vengeance would have been taken of kay or ever he might have turned him thence 
for never did no i man see greater dole made in the king s court than they of the table round made for the youth 
king arthur and the queen were so sticken of sorrow that none durstcall upon them to make cheer 
the damsel that brought thither the coffer was well avenged of the shame that messire kay the seneschal had done her on a day that was past for this thing would not have been known so soon save it had been by her 
vii 
when the mourning for the king s son was abated , lancelot and many others said unto him , sir , you know well that god willeth you should go to the caste that was king fisherman s on pilgrimage to the mostholy graal , for it is not right to delay a thing that one hath in covenant with god 
lords , saith the king , right willingly will i go , and thereto am i right well disposed 
the king apparelleth himself for the pilgrimage , and saith that messire gawain and lancelot shall go with him , without more knights , and taketh a squire to wait upon his body , and the queen herself would he have taken thither but for the mourning she made for her son , whereof none might give her any comfort 
or ever the king departed he made the head be brought into the isle of avalon , to a chapel of our lady that was there , where was a worshipful holy hermit that was well loved of our lord 
the king departed from cardoil and took leave of the queen and all the knights 
lancelot and messire gawain go along with him and a squire that carrieth their arms 
kay the seneschal was departed from the court for drad of the king and his knights 
he durstnot abide in the greater britain , and so betook himself into the lesser 
briant of the isles was of great power in those times , a knight of great stength and hardiment , for all great britain had had many disputes between him and king arthur 
his land was full stong of castes and forest and right fruitful , and many good knights had he in his land 
when he knew that kay the seneschal had departed in such sort from the court , and that he had crossed the sea , he sent for him and held him of his household , and said that he would hold him harmless againstthe king and againstall  men 
when he knew that the king had departed he began to war upon the land and to slay his men and to challenge his castes 
title i 
the stry saith that king arthur goeth his way and lancelot and messire gawain with him , and they had ridden so far one day that night came on in a forestand they might find no hold 
messire gawain marvelled him much that they had ridden the day long without finding neither hold nor hermitage 
night was come and the sky was dark and the forestfull of gloom 
they knew not whitherward to turn to pass the night 
lords , saith the king , where may we be able to alight to night 
sir , we know not , for this forestis fight wearisome 
they make the squire climb up a tall tree and tell him to look as far as he may to try whether he may espy any hold or house where they may lodge 
the squire looketh on all sides , and then telleth them he seeth a fire a long way off as if it were in a wast house , but that he seeth nought there save the fire and the house 
take good heed , saith lancelot , in which quarter it is , so that you may know well how to lead us thither 
he saith that right eath may he lead them 
ii 
with that he cometh down and mounteth again on his hackney , and they go forward a great pace and ride until they espy the fire and the hold 
they pass on over a bridge of wattles , and find the courtyard all deserted and the house from within great and high and hideous 
there was a great fire within whereof the heat might be felt from afar 
they alight of their horses , and the squire drweth them on one side amidstthe hall , and the knights set them beside the fire all armed 
the squire seeth a chamber in the house and entereth thereinto to see if he may find any meat for the horses , but he cometh forth again the swiftesthe may and crieth right sweetly on the mother of the saviour 
they ask him what aileth him , and he saith that he hath found the mosttreacherous chamber ever he found yet , for he felt there , what with heads and what with hands , more than two hundrd men dead , and saith that never yet felt he so sore afeared 
lancelot went into the chamber to see whether he spake true , and felt the men that lay dead , and groped among them from head to head and felt that there was a great heap of them there , and came back and sate at the fire all laughing 
the king asketh whether the  squire had told truth 
lancelot answereth him yea , and that never yet had he found so many dead men together 
methinketh , saith messire gawain , sith that they are dead we have nought to fear of them , but god protect us from the living 
iii 
while they were talking thus , behold you a damsel that cometh into the dwelling on foot and all alone , and she cometh lamenting right grievously 
ha , god 
saith she , how long a penance is this for me , and when will it come to an end 
she seeth the knights sitting in the midstof the house 
fair lord god , saith she , is he there within through whom i am to escape from this great dolour 
the knights hearken to her with great wonderment 
they look and see her enter within the door , and her kirtle was all torn with thorns and briars in the forest  her feet were all bleeding for that she was unshod 
she had a face of exceeding great beauty 
she carried the half of a dead man , and castit into the chamber with the others 
she knew lancelot again so soon as she saw him 
ha , god  
saith she , i am quit of my penance 
sir , saith she , welcome may you be , you and your company 
lancelot looketh at her in wonderment 
damsel , saith he , are you a thing on god s behalf 
certes , sir , saith she , yea 
nor be you adrad of nought 
i am the damsel of the caste of beards , that was wont to deal with knights so passing foully as you have seen 
you did away the toll that was levied on the knights that passed by , and you lay in the caste that demanded it of them that passed through the demesne thereof 
you had me in covenant that so the holy graal should appear unto you , you would come back to me , for otherwise never should i have been willing to let you go 
you returned not , for that you saw not the graal 
for the shame that i did to knights was this penance laid upon me in this forestand this manor , to lastuntil such time as you should come 
for the cruelty i did them was sore grievous , for never was knight brought to me but i made his nose be cut off or his eyes thrustout , and some were there as you saw that had their feet or their hands sticken off 
now have i paid full dear thereof since , for needs musti carry into this chamber all the knights that are slain in this forest and within this manor musti castthem according to the custm thereof , alone , without company 
this knight that i carried in but now hath lain so long in the forestthat wild beast have eaten half of his body 
now am i quit of  this foul penance , thanks to god and to you , save only that i mustgo back when it shall be daylight in like manner as i came here 
damsel , saith lancelot , right glad am i that we should have come to lodge the night here within , for love of you , for i never saw i damsel that might do so cruel penance 
sir , saith she , you know not yet what it is , but you will know it ere long this night , both you and your fellows , and the lord god shield you from death and from mischief 
every night cometh a rout of knights that are black and foul and hideous , albeit none knoweth whence they come , and they do battle right sore the one againstother , and the stur endureth of a right long while 
one knight that came within yonder by chance , the firstnight i came hither , in like manner as you have come , made a circle round me with his sword , and i sate within it as soon as i saw them coming , and so had i no drad of them , for i had in remembrance the saviour of the world and his passing sweet mother 
you will do the same , and you believe me herein , for these are knights fiends 
lancelot drweth his sword and maketh a great circle round the houseplace , and they were within 
v 
thereupon , behold you the knights that come through the forestwith such a rushing as it seemed they would rend it all up by the roots 
afterward , they enter into the manor and snatch great blazing firebrands and fling them one at another 
they enter into the house battling together , and are keen to fall upon the knights , but they may not 
they hurl the firebrands at them from afar , but they are holding their shields and their swords naked 
lancelot maketh semblant as though he would leap towards them , and sore great cowardize it seemeth him nor to go againstthem 
sir , saith the damsel , take heed that you go not forth of the circle , for you will be in sore jeopardy of death , for well you see what evil folk be these 
lancelot was nor minded to hold himself back , but that he would go toward them sword drwn , and they run upon him on all sides , but he defendeth him stutly and smiteth the burning firebrands so that he maketh redhot charcoal fly , and thrusreth his sword amidsttheir faces 
king arthur and messire gawain leap up to help lancelot and smite upon these evil folk and cut them limb from limb , and they bellow like fiends so that the whole forestresoundeth thereof 
when they fell to the ground , they may no longer endure , but become fiends and ashes , and their bodies and their horses become devils all black in the shape of ravens that come forth of their bodies 
they marvel right sore what this may be , and say that such hostl is right grievous 
vi 
when they had put them all to the worse , they sate them down again and restd 
scarce were they seated or ever another rout of yet blacker folk came about them , and they bare spears burning and flaming , and many of them carried dead knights that they had slain in the forest and drpped them in the midstof the house , and then bid the damsel carry and set them with the others 
howbeit , she answereth that she is quit of their commandment and service , nor no longer is forced to do nought for them sith that she hath done her penance 
they thrustforward their spears toward the king and the two knights , as though they were come to avenge their companions 
they all three leapt up together and attacked them right stutly 
this rout was greater and of knights more hideous 
they began to press the king and his knights hard , and they might not put them to the worse as they did the others 
while they were thus in the thickestof the conflict , they heard the stoke of a bell sounding , and forthwith the knight fiends departed and hurried away a great pace 
lords , saith the damsel , had this sound not been heard , scarce might you have endured , for yet another huge rout of this folk was coming in such sort as that none might have withstod them , and this sound have i heard every night , whereby my life hath been saved 
vii 
josephus telleth us that as at this time was there no bell neither in greater britain nor in lesser 
folk were called together by a horn , and in many places there were sheets of stel , and in other places clappers of wood 
king arthur marvelled him much of this sound , so clear and sweet was it , and it well seemed him that it came on god s behalf , and right fain was he to see a bell and so he might 
they were the night until the morrow in the house , as i tell you 
the damsel took leave of them and so departed 
as they came forth of the hold , they met three hermits that told them they were going to search for the bodies that were in this manor so that they might bury them in a wast chapel that was hard by , for such knights had lain there as that henceforward the haunting of the evil folk would be styed in such sort as that they would have no more power to do hurt to any , wherefore they would set therewithin a worshipful hermit that should build up the place in holiness for the service of god 
the king was right joyful thereof , and told them that it had been too perilous 
they parted from the hermits and entered into a forest nor was there never a day so long as king arthur was on pilgrimage , so saith the histry , but he heard the sound of one single bell every hour , whereof he was right glad 
he bade messire gawain and lancelot that they should everywhere conceal his name , and that they should call him not lord but comrde 
they yielded him his will , and prayed to our lord that he would guide and lead them to such a caste and such a hostl as that they might be lodged honourably therein 
they rode on until evening drw nigh , and they found a right fair hold in the forest whereinto they entered and alighted 
the damsel of the hold came to meet them and made them right great cheer , then made them be disarmed , afterward bringeth them right rich robes to wear 
she looketh at lancelot and knoweth him again 
viii 
sir , saith she , you had once , on a day that is past right great pity of me , and saved me my honour , whereof am i in great unhappiness 
better love i to suffer misease in honour , than to have plenty and abundance in shame or reproach , for shame endureth , but sorrow is soon overpassed 
thereupon behold you the knight of the hold , whither he cometh from shooting in the forestand maketh carry in full great plenty venison of deer and wild boar 
he alighted to greet the knights , and began to laugh when he saw lancelot 
by my head , saith he , i know you well for you disappointed me of the thing i bestloved in the world , and made me marry this damsel that never yet had joy of me , nor never shall have 
faith , sir , saith lancelot , you will do your pleasure therein , for she is yours 
truth it is that i made you marry her , for you were fain to do her a disgrace and a shame in such sort that her kinsfolk would have had shame of her 
by my head , saith the knight , the damsel that i loved before loveth you no better hereof , nay , rather , fain would she procure your vexation and your hurt and your shame if she may , and great power hath she in this forest sir , saith lancelot , i have sithence spoken to her and she to me , and so hath she told me her will and her wish 
thereupon the knight bade the knights take water , and the lady taketh the basins and presenteth water to the knights 
avoid , damsel , saith the king , take it away 
never , please god , shall it befall that we should accept such service from you 
by my head , saith the knight , but so mustyou needs do , for other than she shall not serve you tonight in this matter , or otherwise shall you not eat with me this night there within 
ix 
lancelot understndeth that the knight is not overburdened of courtesy , and he seeth the table garnished of good meat , and bethinketh him he will not do well to lose such ease , for misease enough had they the night before 
he maketh the king take water of the lady , and the same service did she for all of them 
the knight biddeth them be seated 
the king would have made the lady sit beside him at the table , but the knight said that there she should not sit 
she goeth to sit among the squires as she was wont to do 
the knights are sorry enough thereof , but they durstnot gainsay the will of her lord 
when they had eaten , the knight said to lancelot , now may you see what she hath gained of me by your making me take her perforce , nor never , so help me god , so long as i live shall she be honoured otherwise by me , for so have i promised her that i love far more 
sir , saith lancelot , to my thinking you do ill herein and a sin , and meseemeth you should have great blame thereof of them that know it , and may your churlishness be your own , for nought thereof take i to myself 
x 
lancelot telleth the king and messire gawain that were he not lodged in his hostl , and had him outside of the hold , he would willingly have set the blood of his body on it but he would have handled him in such sort as that the lady should be maintained in greater honour , either by force or by prayer , in like manner as he did when he made him marry her 
they were right well lodged the night and lay in the hold until the morrow , when they departed thence , and rode right busily on their journeys until they came into a very different land , scarce inhabited of any folk , and found a little caste in a combe 
they came thitherward and saw that the enclosure of the caste was fallen down into an abysm , so that none might approach it on that side , but it had a right fair gateway and a door tall and wide whereby one entered 
they beheld a chapel that was right fair and rich , and below was a great ancient hall 
they saw a priestappear in the midstof the caste , bald and old , that had come forth of the chapel 
they are come thither and alighted , and asked the priestwhat the caste was , and he told them that it was the great tintagel 
how is this ground all caved in about the caste 
sir , saith the priest i will tell you 
sir , saith he , king uther pendrgon , that was father of king arthur , held a great court and summoned all his barons 
the king of this caste that then was here was named gorlois 
he went to the court and took his wife with him , that was named ygerne , and she was the fairestdame in any kingdom 
king uther sought acquaintance of her for her great beauty , and regarded her and honoured her more than all the others of his court 
king gorlois departed thence and made the queen come back to this caste for the drad that he had of king uther pendrgon 
king uther was very wroth with him , and commanded him to send back the queen his wife 
king godois said that he would not 
thereupon king uther pendrgon defied him , and then laid siege about this caste where the queen was 
king gorlois was gone to seek for succour 
king uther pendrgon had merlin with him of whom you have heard tell , that was so crafty 
he made him be changed into the semblance of king gorlois , so that he entered there within by merlin s art and lay that night with the queen , and so begat king arthur in a great hall that was next to the enclosure there where this abysm is 
for this sin hath the ground sunken in on this wise 
he cometh with them toward the chapel that was right fair , and had a right rich sepulchre therein 
lords , in this sepulchre was placed the body of merlin , but never mought it be set inside the chapel , wherefore perforce it remained outside 
know of a very truth that the body lieth not within the sepulchre , for , so soon as it was set therein , it was taken out and snatched away , either on god s behalf or the enemy s , but which we know not 
xi 
sir , saith king arthur , and what became of king gorlois 
sir 
saith he , the king slew him on the morrow of the night he lay with his wife , and so forthwith espoused queen ygerne , and in such manner as i tell you was king arthur conceived in sin that is now the bestking in the world 
king arthur hath heard this as concerning his birth that he knew not , and is a little shamed thereof and confounded on account of messire gawain and lancelot 
he himself marvelleth much thereof , and much it misliketh him that the priesthath said so much 
they lay the night in the hold , and so departed thence on the morrow when they had heard mass 
lancelot and messire gawain , that thought they knew the forest found the land so changed and different that they knew not whither they were become , and such an one as should come into the land that had been king fisherman s , and he should come again another time within forty days , should not find the caste within a year 
xii 
josephus telleth us that the semblances of the islands changed themselves by reason of the divers adventures that by the pleasure of god befell therein , and that the questof adventures would not have pleased the knights so well and they had not found them so different 
for , when they had entered into a forestor an island where they had found any adventure , and they came there another time , they found holds and castes and adventures of another kind , so that their toils and travails might not weary them , and also for that god would that the land should be conformed to the new law 
they were the knights that had more toil and travail in seeking adventures than all the knights of the world before them , and in holding to that whereof they had made covenant 
nor of no court of no king in the world went forth so many good knights as went forth from the court of king arthur , and but that god loved them so much , never might they have endured such toil and travail as they did from day to day 
for without fait , good knights were they , and good knights not only to deal hard buffets , but rather in that they were loyal and true , and had faith in the saviour of the world and his sweet mother , and therefore draded shame and loved honour 
king arthur goeth on his way and messire gawain and lancelot with him , and they pass through many stange countries , and so enter into a great forest  lancelot called to remembrance the knight that he had slain in the wast city whither behoved him to go , and knew well that the day whereon he should come was drwing nigh 
he told king arthur as much , and then said , that and he should go not , he would belie his covenant 
they rode until they came to a cross where the ways forked 
sir , saith lancelot , behoveth me go to acquit me of my pledge , and i go in great adventure and peril of death , nor know i whether i may live at all thereafter , for i slew the knight , albeit i was right sorry thereof , but or ever i slew him , i had to swear that i would go set my head in the like jeopardy as he had set his 
now the day drweth nigh that i mustgo thither , for i am unwilling to fail of my covenant , whereof i should be blamed , and , so god grant me to escape therefrom , i will follow you speedily 
the king embraceth him and kisseth him at parting and messire gawain also , and they pray god preserve his body and his life , and that they may see him again ere it be long 
lancelot would willingly have sent salute to the queen had he durst for she lay nearer his heart than aught beside , but he would not that the king nor messire gawain should misdeem of the love they might carry to their kinswoman 
the love is so rooted in his heart that he may not leave it , into what peril soever he may go 
rather , he prayeth god every day as sweetly as he may , that he save the queen , and that he may deliver his body from this jeopardy 
he hath ridden until that he cometh at the hour of noon into the wast city , and findeth the city empty as it was the firsttime he was there 
xiii 
in the city wherein lancelot had arrived were many wast houses and rich palaces fallen down 
he had scarce entered within the city when he heard a great cry and lamentation of dames and damsels , but he knew not on which side it was , and they say  ha , god , how hath the knight betrayed us that slew the knight , inasmuch as he returneth not 
this day is the day come that he ought to redeem his pledge 
never again ought any to put trustin knight , for that he cometh not 
the others that came hither before him have failed us , and so will he also for drad of death 
for he smote off the head of the comeliestknight that was in this kingdom and the best wherefore ought he also to have his own smitten off , but good heed taketh he to save it if he may 
thus spake the damsels 
lancelot much marvelled where they might be , for nought could he espy of them , albeit he cometh before the palace , there where he slew the knight 
he alighteth , then maketh fasthis horse s reins to a ring that was fixed in the mountingstge of marble 
scarce hath he done so , when a knight alighteth , tall and comely and stong and deliver , and he was clad in a short closefitted jerkin of silk , and held the axe in his hand wherewith lancelot had smitten off the head of the other knight , and he came sharpening it on a whetstne to cut the better 
lancelot asketh him , what will you do with this axe 
by my head , saith the knight , that shall you know in such sort as my brother knew when you cut off his head , so i may speed of my business 
how 
saith lancelot , will you slay me then 
that shall you know , saith he , or ever you depart hence 
have you not loyally promised hereof that you would set your head in the same jeopardy as the knight set his , whom you slew without defence 
no otherwise may you depart therefrom 
wherefore now come forward without delay and kneel down and stetch your neck even as my brother did , and so will i smite off your head , and , if you do nor this of your own good will , you shall soon find one that shall make you do it perforce , were you twenty knights as good as you are one 
well i know that you have not come hither for this , but only to fulfil your pledge , and that you will raise no contention herein 
lancelot thinketh to die , and is minded to abide by that he hath in covenant without fail , wherefore he lieth down on the ground as it were on a cross , and crieth mercy of god 
he mindeth him of the queen , and crieth god of mercy and saith , ha , lady saith he , never shall i see you more 
might i have seen you yet once again before i die , exceeding great comfort had it been to me , and my soul would have departed from me more at ease 
this , that never shall i see you more , as now it seemeth me , troubleth me more than the death whereby behoveth me to die , for die one mustwhen one hath lived long enough 
faithfully do i promise you that my love shall fail you not yet , and never shall it be but that my soul shall love you in the other world like as my body hath loved you in this , if thus the soul may love 
with that the tears fell from his eyes , nor , never sithence that he was knight , saith the stry , had he wept for nought that had befallen him nor for heaviness of heart , but this time and one other 
he taketh three blades of grass and so eateth thereof in token of the holy communion , then signeth him of the cross and blesseth him , riseth up , setteth himself on his knees and stetcheth forth his neck 
the knight lifteth up the axe 
lancelot heareth the blow coming , boweth his head and the axe misseth him 
he saith to him , sir knight , so did not my brother that you slew 
rather , he held his head and neck quite stll , and so behoveth you to do 
two damsels appeared at the palacewindows of passing great beauty , and they knew lancelot well 
as the knight was aiming a second blow , one of the damsels crieth to him , and you would have my love for evermore , throw down the axe and cry the knight quit 
otherwise have you lostme for ever 
the knight forthwith flingeth down the axe and falleth at lancelot s feet and crieth mercy of him as of the mostloyal knight in the world 
you 
have mercy on me , you 
slay me not 
saith lancelot , for it is of you that i ought to pray mercy 
sir , saith the knight , of a surety will i not do this 
rather will i help you to my power to save your life againstall men , for all you have slain my brother 
the damsels come down from the palace and are come to lancelot 
xiv 
sir , say they to lancelot , greatly ought we to love you , yea , better than all knights in the world beside 
for we are the two damsels , sistrs , that you saw so poor at the wast caste where you lay in our brother s house 
you and messire gawain and another knight gave us the treasure and the hold of the robber knights that you slew 
for this city which is wast and the wast caste of my brother would never again be peopled of folk , nor should we never have had the land again , save a knight had come hither as loyal as are you 
full a score knights have arrived here by chance in the same manner as you came , and not one of them but hath slain a brother or a kinsman and cut off his head as you did to the knight , and each one promised to return at the day appointed 
all failed of their covenant , for not one of them durstcome to the day 
so you had failed us in like manner as the others , we should have lostthis city without recovery and the castes that are its appanages 
xv 
the knight and the damsels lead lancelot into the palace and then make him be disarmed 
they hear presently how the greatestjoy in the world is being made in many parts of the forest that was nigh the city 
sir , say the damsels , now may you hear the joy that is made of your coming 
these are the burgesses and dwellers in the city that already know the tidings 
lancelot leaneth at the windows of the hall , and seeth the city peopled of the fairestfolk in the world , and great thronging in the broad steets and the great palace , and clerks and priest coming in long procession praising god and blessing him for that they may now return to their church , and giving benison to the knight through whom they are free to repair thither 
lancelot was much honoured throughout the city 
the two damsels are at great pains to wait upon him , and right great worship had he of all them that were therewithin and them that came thither , both clerks and priest 
title i 
therewithal the histry is silent of lancelot , and speaketh word of the king and messire gawain , that are in sore misgiving as concerning him , for right gladly would they have heard tidings of him 
they met a knight that was coming all armed , and messire gawain asketh him whence he came , and he said that he came from the land of the queen of the golden circlet , to whom a sore loss hath befallen 
for the son of the widow lady had won the circlet of gold for that he had slain the knight of the drgon , and she was to keep it safe for him and deliver it up to him at his will 
now hath nabigant of the rock reft her thereof , and a right outrageous knight is he and puissant 
wherefore hath he commanded a damsel that she bring it to an assembly of knights that is to be held in the meadow of the tent of the two damsels , there where messire gawain did away the evil custm 
the damsel that will bring the golden circlet will give it to the knight that shall do bestat the assembly 
nabigant is keenly set upon having it , and maketh the more sure for that once aforetime he hath had it by force of arms 
i am going to the knights that know not these tidings , in order that when they shall hear them , they shall go to the assembly 
therewithal the knight departeth 
the king and messire gawain have ridden so far that they come to the tent where messire gawain destoyed the evil custm by slaying the two knights 
he found the tent garnished within and without in like manner as it was when he was there , and messire gawain made the king be seated on a quilted mattress of staw , right costy , and thereafter be disarmed of a squire , and he himself disarmed him , and they washed their hands and faces for the rustwherewith both of them were besmuttered 
messire gawain found the chest unlocked that were at the head of the couch , and made the king be apparelled of white rich stffs that he found , and a robe of cloth of silk and gold , and he clad himself in the like manner , neither was the chestnot a whit disfurnished thereby , for the tent was all garnished of rich adornments 
when they were thus dight , a man might have sought far or ever he should find so comely knights 
ii 
thereupon , behold you the two damsels of the tent coming 
damsels , saith messire gawain , welcome may you be 
sir , say they , good adventure may you have both twain 
it seemeth us that you take right boldly that which is ours , yet never for neither of us would you do a thing whereof you were beseeched 
messire gawain saith the elder , no knight is there in this kingdom but would be right joyous and he supposed that i loved him , and i prayed you of your love on a day that is past for the valour of your knighthood , yet never did you grant it me 
how durstyou have affiance in me of aught , and take the things that are mine own so boldly , when i may not have affiance in you 
damsel , for your courtesy and the good custm of the land 
for you told me when the evil custms were overthrown , that all the honours and all the courtesies that are due to knights should ever be ready within for all them that should come hither for harbour 
messire gawain , you say true , but of right might one let the courtesy tarry and pay back churlishness by churlishness 
iii 
the assembly of knights will begin tomorrow in this launde that is so fair 
there will be knights in plenty , and the prize will be the circlet of gold 
now shall we see who will do best  the assembly will lastthree whole days , and of one thing at leastyou may well make boastbetween you and your comrde , that you have the fairesthostl and the mostpleasant and the mostquiet of any knights at the assembly 
the younger damsel looketh at king arthur 
you , saith she , what will you do 
will you be as stange toward us as messire gawain is friendly with others 
iv 
damsel , saith the king , messire gawain will do his pleasure and i mine 
stange shall i not be in respect of you , nor toward other damsels 
rather shall they be honoured on my part so long as i live , and i myself will be at your commandment 
sir , saith she , gramercy greatly 
i pray you , therefore , that you be my knight at the tournament 
damsel , this ought i not to refuse you , and right glad at heart shall i be and i may do aught that shall please you 
for all knights ought to be at pains for the sake of dame or damsel 
sir , saith she , what is your name 
v 
damsel , saith he , my name is arthur , and i am of tincardoil 
have you nought to do with king arthur 
damsel , already have i been many times at his court , and , if he loved me not nor i him , i should not be in messire gawain s company 
in truth , he is the king in the world that i love best the damsel looketh at king arthur , but wotteth not a whir that it is he , and full well is she pleased with the seeming and countenance of him 
as for the king , lightly might he have trustd that he should have her as his ladylove so long as he remained with her 
there is much to say betwixt his semblant and his thought , for he showeth good semblant toward the damsel , that hath over much affiance therein , but his thought is on queen guenievre in what place soever he may be 
for nought loveth he so well as her 
vi 
the damsels made stble the horses and purvey for the bodies of the knights right richly at night , and they lay in two right rich beds in the midstof the hall , and their arms were all set ready before 
the damsels would not depart until such time as they were asleep 
the harness of the knights that came to the assembly came on the morrow from all parts 
they set up their booths and stetched their tents all round about the launde of the forest  king arthur and messire gawain were risen in the morning and saw the knights come from all parts 
the elder damsel cometh to messire gawain and saith unto him , sir , saith she , i will that you bear today red arms that i will lend you , for the love of me , and take heed that they be well employed , and i desire that you should not be known by your arms 
rather let it be said that you are the red knight , and you shall allow it accordingly 
damsel , gramercy greatly 
saith messire gawain ,  i will do my endeavour in arms the besti may for love of you 
the younger damsel cometh to king arthur 
sir , saith she , my sistr hath made her gift and i will make mine 
i have a suit of arms of gold , the richestthat knight may wear , that i will lend you , for methinketh they will be better employed on you than on ever another knight 
i pray you that you remember me at the assembly in like manner as i shall ofttimes remember you 
vii 
damsel , saith the king , gramercy 
no knight is there that should see you but ought to have you in remembrance in his heart for your courtesy and your worth 
the knights were come about the tents 
the king and messire gawain were armed and had made caparison their horses right richly 
the damsel that should give the golden circlet was come 
nabigant of the rock had brought great fellowships of knights together with him , and ordinance was made for the assembly 
viii 
the younger damsel saith to king arthur  well may you know that no knight that is here this day hath better arms than are yours , wherefore take heed that you show you to be good knight for love of me 
damsel , saith king arthur , god grant that i be so 
they laid hold on their reins and mounted their horses , that made great leaping and went away a great gallop 
saith the younger damsel to her sistr  what think you of my knight , doth he not please you 
yea , saith the elder , but sore misliketh me of messire gawain for that he is not minded to do as i would have him 
he shall yet aby it dear 
king arthur and messire gawain stike into the midstof the assembly like as it were two lions unchained , and at their firstcoming they smite down two knights to the ground under the feet of their horses 
messire gawain taketh the two horses and sendeth them by a squire to the damsels of the tent , that made much joy thereof 
after that were they not minded to take more booty as of horses or arms , but searched the fellowships on one side and the other 
nor was there no knight that came againstthem but they pierced his shield or bore him to the ground , insomuch as none was there that might endure their buffets 
nabigant espieth messire gawain and cometh toward him , and messire gawain toward him again , and they hurtle together either on other so stongly that messire gawain beareth nabigant to the ground , him and his horse together all in a heap 
king arthur was not idle , for no knight durstcome againsthim but he overthrew him , so as that all withdrw them back and avoided his buffets 
many knights did well that day at the assembly , but none might be the match of either of them twain in deeds of arms , for , save it were lancelot or perceval , were no knights on live that had in them so much hardiment and valour 
after that it was evensong the knights drw them back to their tents , and they say all that the knight of the golden arms and the knight of the red arms had done better than they all at the assembly 
king arthur and messire gawain come back to the tent of the damsels , that make disarm them and do upon them the rich robes and make great joy of them 
thereupon , behold you , a dwarf that cometh  damsels , make great joy 
for all they of the assembly say with one accord that your knights have done bestthis day 
king arthur and messire gawain sate to eat , and right well were they served of every kind of meats and of great cups of wine and sops in wine 
king arthur made the younger damsel sit beside him , and messire gawain the elder in like manner , and when they had eaten they went to lie down and fell on sleep , for right sore weary were they and forespent of the many buffets they had given and received , and they slept until the morrow 
ix 
when the day appeared they rose up 
thereupon , behold you the younger damsel where she cometh and saluteth king arthur 
you , damsel 
saith king arthur , god give you joy and good adventure 
sir , saith she , i will that you bear today these white arms that you see here , and that you do no worse today than yestrday you did , sith that better you may not do 
messire gawain , saith the elder damsel , remember you of the king there where his land was compassed about of a wall of stne , and you harboured one night in his caste , what time you went to seek for the sword wherewith john baptistwas beheaded , when he was fain to take away the sword from you , whereof you had so sore misliking 
natheless , he yielded you up the sword upon covenant that you should do that which a damsel should firstask you to do thereafter , and you promised him loyally that so would you do 
certes , damsel , saith messire gawain , well do i remember the same 
now , therefore , saith the damsel , would i fain prove whether you be indeed so loyal as men say , and whether you will hold your covenant that you made 
wherefore i pray and beseech you that this day you shall be he that doth worstof all the knights at the assembly , and that you bear none other arms save your own only , so as that you shall be known again of all them that are there present 
so you will not do this , then will you have failed of your covenant , and myself will go tell the king that you have broken the promise that you made to him right loyally 
damsel , saith messire gawain , never yet brake i covenant with none , so it were such as i might fulfil or another on my behalf 
king arthur made arm him of the white arms that the younger damsel had given him , and messire gawain of his own , but sore it irked him of this that the damsel hath laid upon him to do , sith that needs musthe lose worship and he hold to his covenant , albeit not for nought that is in the world will he fail of the promise he hath made 
they come into the assembly 
x 
king arthur smiteth with his spurs like a good knight and overthroweth two knights in his onset , and messire gawain rideth a bandon betwixt two fellowships to be the better known 
the mostpart say , see 
there is messire gawain , the good knight that is king arthur s nephew 
nabigant of the rock cometh toward him as fastas his horse may carry him , lance in rest  messire gawain seeth him coming toward him right furiously 
he castth his shield down on the ground and betaketh him to flight as swiftly as he may 
they that beheld him , some two score or more , marvel thereof , and say , did ever one see the like overpassing cowardize 
nabigant saith that he never yet followed a knight that was vanquished , nor never will follow one of such conditions , for no great prize would it be to take him and win his horse 
other knights come to joustwith him , but messire gawain fleeth and avoideth them the besthe may , and maketh semblance that none is there he durstabide 
he drweth toward king arthur for safety 
the king hath great shame of this that he seeth him do , and right sore pains hath he of defending messire gawain , for he holdeth as close to him as the pie doth to the bramble when the falcon would take her 
in such shame and dishonour was messire gawain as long as the assembly lastd , and the knights said that he had gotten him off with much less than he deserved , for that never had they seen so craven knight at assembly or tournament as was he , nor never henceforth would they have drad of him as they had heretofore 
from this day forward may many lightly avenge themselves upon him of their kinsfolk and friends that he hath slain by the forest   the assembly brake up in the evening , whereof the king and messire gawain were right well pleased 
the knights disarm them at their hostls and the king and messire gawain at the damsels  tent 
xi 
with that , behold you the dwarf that cometh 
by my head , damsels , your knights go from bad to worse 
of him in the white arms one may even let pass , but messire gawain is the mostcoward ever saw i yet , and so he were to run upon me tomorrow and i were armed like as is he , i should think me right well able to defend me againsthim 
tis the devil took him to a place where is such plenty of knights , for the more folk that are there the better may one judge of his ill conditions 
you , sir , saith he to the king , wherefore do you keep him company 
you would have done besttoday had he not been there 
he skulked as close by you , to be out of the buffets , as a hare doth to the wood for the hounds 
no business hath good knight to hold company with a coward 
i say not this for that i would make him out worse that he is , for i remember the two knights he slew before this tent 
the damsel heareth the dwarf talking and smileth thereat , for she understndeth that blame enough hath messire gawain had at the assembly 
the knights said at their hostls that they knew not to whom to give the circlet of gold , sith that the knight of the golden armour and he of the red armour were not there 
for they did the bestthe firstday of the assembly , and much they marvelled that they should not come when it was continued on the morrow 
gawain , saith the king , sore blame have you had this day , and i myself have been all shamed for your sake 
never thought i that so good a knight as you might ever have known how to counterfeit a bad knight as you did 
you have done much for the love of the damsel , and right well had she avenged herself of you and you had done her great annoy 
howbeit , and tomorrow your cowardize be such as it hath been today , never will the day be when you shall not have blame thereof 
xii 
by my faith 
saith messire gawain , behoveth me do the damsel s pleasure sith that we have fallen by illchance into her power 
they went to bed at night and took their restas soon as they had eaten , and on the morrow the damsel came to messire gawain 
i will , saith she , that you be clad in the same arms as was your comrde on the firstday , right rich , that i will lend you , and i will , moreover , that you be knight so good as that never on any day were you better 
i command you , by the faith you pledged me the other day , to obey this caution , that you make yourself known to none , and so any man in the world shall ask your name , you shall say that you are the knight of the golden arms 
damsel , saith gawain , gramercy , i will do your pleasure 
the younger damsel cometh back to the king  sir , saith she , i will that you wear new arms  you shall bear them red , the same as messire gawain bore the firstday , and i pray you be such as you were the firstday , or better 
xiii 
damsel , i will do my bestto amend myself and my doings , and right well pleased am i of that it pleaseth you to say 
their horses were caparisoned and the knights mounted , all armed 
they come together to the tournament with such an onset as that they pass through the thickestof the press and overthrew knights and horses as many as they encountered 
king arthur espieth nabigant that came right gaily caparisoned , and smiteth him so passing stong a buffet in the midstof his breastthat he beareth him down from his horse , in such sort that he breaketh his collarbone , and presenteth the destier , by his squire , to the younger damsel , that maketh great joy thereof 
messire gawain searcheth the fellowships on all sides , and so well did he search that scarce was one might endure his blows 
king arthur is not idle , but pierceth shields and beateth in helms , the while all look on in wonderment at him and messire gawain 
the stry saith that the king would have done stll better , but that he put not forth his full stength in deeds of arms , for that messire gawain had done so ill the day before , and now he would fain that he should have the prize 
xiv 
the damsel that held the golden circlet was in the midstof the assembly of knights , and had set it in a right rich casket of ivory with precious stnes , right worshipfully 
when the damsel saw that the assembly was at an end , she made all the knights sty , and prayed them they should speak judgment true , concealing nought , who had bestdeserved of arms , and ought therefore of right to have the golden circle 
they said all , that of right judgment the knight of the golden arms and he of the red arms ought to have the prize above all the others , but that of these two , he of the golden arms ought to have the prize , for so well did he the firstday as that no knight might do better , and on the lastday likewise , and that if he of the red arms had put forth his full stength on the lastday , he would have done full as well or better 
the circlet of gold was brought to messire gawain , but it was not known that it was he 
messire gawain would fain that it had been given to my lord king arthur 
the knights departed from the assembly 
the king and messire gawain came back to the tent and brought the golden circlet , whereof the damsels made great joy 
thereupon , behold you 
the dwarf that cometh back 
damsels , better is it to lodge knights such as these than messire gawain the coward , the craven that had so much shame at the assembly 
you yourselves would have been sore blamed had you lodged him 
this knight hath won the golden circlet by force of arms , and messire gawain nought but shame and reproach 
the damsel laugheth at this that the dwarf saith , and biddeth him on his eyes and head , begone 
xv 
the king and messire gawain were disarmed 
sir , saith the damsel , what will you do with the golden circlet 
damsel , saith messire gawain , i will bear it to him that firstwon it in sore peril of death , and delivered it to the queen that ought to have kept it safe , of whom it hath been reft by force 
the king and messire gawain lay the night in the tent 
the younger damsel cometh to the king 
sir , many feats of arms have you done at the assembly , as i have been told , for love of me , and i am ready to reward you 
damsel , right great thanks 
your reward and your service love i much , and your honour yet more , wherefore i would that you should have all the honour that any damsel may have , for in damsel without honour ought none to put his affiance 
our lord god grant you to preserve yours 
damsel , saith she to the other that sitteth before messire gawain , this knight and messire gawain have taken counsel together 
there is neither solace nor comfort in them 
let us leave them to go to sleep , and ill restmay they have , and lord god defend us ever hereafter from such guest 
by my head , saith the eider damsel , were it not for the golden circlet that he is bound of right to deliver again to the queen that had it in charge , who is my lady , they should not depart from this land in such sort as they will 
and messire gawain stll be nice as concerneth damsels , at leasti now know well that he is loyal in anotherwise , so as that he will not fail of his word 
xvi 
with that the damsels departed , as did likewise the king and messire gawain as soon as they saw the day 
nabigant , that was wounded at the tournament , was borne away on a litter 
meliot of logres was in questof messire gawain 
he met the knights and the harness that came from the assembly , and asked of many if they could tell him tidings of king arthur s nephew , messire gawain , and the mostpart answer , yea , and right bad tidings enough 
they ask him wherefore he demandeth 
lords , saith he , his liege man am i , and he ought of right to defend my land againstall men , that nabigant hath taken from me without right nor reason , whom they are carrying from thence in a litter , wherefore i am fain to beseech messire gawain that he help me to recover my land 
in faith , sir knight , say they , we know not of what avail he may be to others that may not help himself 
messire gawain was at the assembly , but we tell you for true , it was he that did worstthereat 
alas , saith meliot of logres , then have i lostmy land , and he hath become even such an one as you tell me 
you would readily believe us , say they , had you seen him at the assembly 
meliot turneth him back , right sorrowful 
xvii 
king arthur and messire gawain depart from the tent , and come a great pace as though they fain would escape thence to come nigher the land where they would be , and great desire had they of the coming of lancelot 
they rode until that they came one night to the wast manor whither the brachet led messire gawain when he found the dead knight that lancelot had slain 
they lodged there the night , and found there knights and damsels of whom they were known 
the lady of the wast manor sent for succour to her knights , saying that she held there king arthur that slew other knights , and that his nephew messire gawain was also there within , but dearly would she have loved that lancelot had been with them that slew her brother 
knights in plenty came to her to do hurt to king arthur and messire gawain , but she had at leastso much courtesy in her that she would not suffer any of them to do them ill within her hold , albeit she kept seven of their number , full of great hardiment , to guard the entrance of the bridge , so that king arthur and messire gawain might not depart thence save only amidstthe points of their spears 
xviii 
this high histry witnesseth us that lancelot was departed from the wast city wherein he was much honoured , and rode until that he came to a forestwhere he met meliot of logres , that was sore dismayed of the tidings he had heard of messire gawain 
lancelot asketh him whence he cometh , and he saith from seeking messire gawain , of whom he had tidings whereof he was right sorrowful 
how , saith lancelot , is he then otherwise than well 
yea , saith he , as i have heard tell  for he wont to be good knight and hath now become evil 
he was at the assembly of knights whereof i met the harness and the fellowships , and they told me that never yet was such cowardize in any knight , but that a knight who was with him did right well 
howsoever he may have borne himself , right fain am i to find him , for , maugre what any may say , i may scarce believe that he is so bad after all 
sir , saith lancelot , i will seek him for you , and you can come along with me and it seemeth you good 
meliot of logres betaketh him back with lancelot 
they ride until they happen by chance upon the wast manor where the king and messire gawain were lodged 
they were armed , and were minded to go forth from thence 
the seven knights guarded the issue , all armed 
the king and messire gawain saw that no good would it do them to remain there within , wherefore they passed over the bridge and came perforce to the place where the seven knights were watching for them 
thereupon , they went toward them all armed and stuck among them , and the knights received them on the points of their lances 
xix 
thereupon , behold you 
lancelot and the knight with him , whom they had not been looking for 
lancelot espied the king and messire gawain 
the knights cried out and stuck among them as a hawk stiketh amongstlarks , and made them scatter on one side and the other 
lancelot hath caught one at his coming , and smiteth him with his spear through the body , and meliot of logres slayeth another 
king arthur knew lancelot , and right glad was he to see him safe and sound , as was messire gawain likewise 
lancelot and meliot of logres made clear the passage for them 
the knights departed , for longer durstthey not abide 
the damsel of the caste held a squire by the hand , that was right passing comely 
she knew lancelot , and when she saw him she called him 
lancelot , you slew this squire s brother , and , please god , either he or another shall take vengeance thereof 
lancelot holdeth his peace when he heareth the dame speak , and departeth from the wast hold 
meliot of logres knew messire gawain and messire gawain him again , and great joy made they the one of the other 
sir , saith meliot , i am come to lay plaint before you of nabigant of the rock that challengeth me of the land whereof i am your man , and saith that he will defend it againstnone but you only 
sir , the day is full nigh , and if you come not to the day , i shall have lostmy quarrel , and you held me thereof in covenant what time i became your man 
right fainly will i go , saith messire gawain 
he goeth his way thither accordingly by leave of the king and lancelot , and saith that he will return to them the speediesthe may 
king arthur and lancelot go their way as fastas they may toward the land that was king fisherman s 
messire gawain rideth until he cometh to the land of nabigant of the rock 
meliot doeth nabigant to wit that messire gawain was come , and that he was ready to uphold his right by him that was his champion 
nabigant was whole of the wound he gat at the assembly , and held messire gawain of full small account for the cowardize that he saw him do , and bid his knights not meddle betwixt them two , for , and messire gawain had been four knights he thought to vanquish them all 
he issueth forth of his caste all armed , and is come there where messire gawain awaited him 
messire gawain seeth him coming , and so drweth on one side , and nabigant , that was strk outrageous , setteth his spear in restand cometh toward messire gawain without another word , and smiteth him on the shield so that he maketh his spear fly all in pieces 
messire gawain catcheth him right in the midstof his breast and pierceth him with his spear through the thick of his heart , and he falleth to the ground dead 
the knights run upon messire gawain 
he lightly delivereth himself of them , and meliot of logres likewise 
messire gawain entereth the caste by force , doing battle againstall the knights , and holdeth them in such a pass as that he maketh them do homage to meliot of logres , and deliver up to him the keys of the caste 
he maketh them come to an assembly from the whole of the land they had reft away from him , and thereafter departeth and followeth after king arthur 
in the forest he overtaketh a damsel that was going on her way a great pace 
damsel , saith messire gawain , lord god guide you , whither away so fast sir , saith she , i am going to the greatestassembly of knights you saw ever 
what assembly 
saith messire gawain 
sir , saith she , at the palace meadow , but the knight i am seeking is he that won the circlet of gold at the meadow of the tent 
fair sir , can you give me any tidings of him 
saith she 
damsel , saith messire gawain , what would you do herein 
certes , sir , i would right fain find him 
my lady , that kept the circlet of gold for the son of the widow lady , that won it aforetime , hath sent me to seek him 
for what intent , damsel 
saith messire gawain 
sir , my lady sendeth for him and beseecheth him by me , for the sake of the saviour of the world , that if he had ever pity of dame or damsel , he will take vengeance on nabigant that hath slain her men and destoyed her land , for she hath been told how he that won back the golden circlet ought of right to take vengeance upon him 
damsel , saith messire gawain , be not any longer troubled hereof , for i tell you that the knight that won the golden circlet by prize of arms hath killed nabigant already 
sir , saith she , how know you this 
i know the knight well , saith he , and i saw him slay him , and behold , here is the circlet of gold that i have as a token hereof , for that he beareth it to him that hath won the graal , to the intent that your lady may be quit of her charge 
messire gawain showeth her the golden circlet in the casket of ivory , that he kept very nigh himself 
right joyful was the damsel that the matter had thus fallen out , and goeth her way back again to tell her lady of her joy 
messire gawain goeth on his way toward the assembly , for well knoweth he that , and king arthur and lancelot have heard the tidings , there will they be 
he goeth thitherward as fastas he may , and as staight , and scarce hath he ridden away or ever he met a squire that seemed right weary , and his hackney sore worn of the way 
messire gawain asked him whence he came , and the squire said to him 
from the land of king arthur , where is great war toward , for that none knoweth not what hath become of him 
many folk go about saying that he is dead , for never sithence that he departed from cardoil , and messire gawain and lancelot with him , have no tidings been heard of him 
he left the queen at cardoil to take his place , and also on account of her son s death , and the mostpart say that he is dead 
briant of the isles and my lord kay with him are burning his land , and carrying off plunder before all the castes 
of all the knights of the table round are there now no more than five and thirty , and of these are ten sore wounded , and they are in cardoil , and there protect the land the bestthey may 
when messire gawain heareth these tidings , they touch his heart right sore , so that he goeth the staightesthe may toward the assembly , and the squire with him that was sore fordone 
messire gawain found king arthur and lancelot , and the knights were come from all the kingdom to the piece of ground 
for a knight was come thither that had brought a white destier and borne thither a right rich crown of gold , and it was known throughout all the lands that marched with this , that the knight that should do bestat the assembly should have the destier and the crown , for the queen that ware it was dead , and it would behove him to guard and defend the land whereof she had been lady 
on account of these tidings had come thither great plenty of folk and of folk 
king arthur and messire gawain and lancelot set them of one side 
the stry saith that at this assembly king arthur bare the red shield that the damsel gave him 
messire gawain had his own , such as he was wont to bear , and lancelot a green shield that he bare for the love of the knight that was slain for helping him in the forest  they stuck into the assembly like lions unchained , and castdown three knights at their firstonset 
they searched the fellowships on every side , smote down knights and overthrew horses 
king arthur overtook no knight but he clave his shield to the boss  all swerved aside and avoided his buffets 
messire gawain and lancelot are not idle on the other hand , but each held well his place 
the more part had wonderment looking at the king , for he holdeth him at bay like a lion when the stghounds would attack him 
the assembly lastd throughout on such wise , and when it came to an end , the knights said and adjudged that the knight of the red shield had surpassed all other in doing well 
the knight that had brought the crown came to the king , but knew him not a whit  sir , saith he , you have by your good deeds of arms won this crown of gold and this destier , whereof ought you to make great joy , so only you have so much valour in you as that you may defend the land of the bestearthly queen that is dead , and whether the king be alive or dead none knoweth , wherefore great worship will it be to yourself and you may have prowess to maintain the land , for right broad is it and right rich and of high sovranty 
saith king arthur , whose was the land , and what was the name of the queen whose crown i see 
sir , the king s name was arthur , and the bestking in the world was he 
in his kingdom the more part say that he is dead 
this crown was the crown of queen guenievre that is dead and buried , whereof is sore sorrow 
the knights that may not leave cardoil lestbriant of the isles should seize the city , they sent me to the kingdom of logres and charged me with the crown and destier for that i have knowledge of the isles and foreign lands 
wherefore they prayed me i should go among the assemblies of knights , that so i might hear tidings of my lord king arthur and my lord gawain and lancelot , and , so i might find them , that i should tell them how the land hath fallen into this grievous sorrow 
king arthur heareth tidings whereof he is full sorrowful 
he drweth on one side , and the knights make the mostgrievous dole in the world 
lancelot knoweth not what he may do , and saith between his teeth that now hath his joy come to an end and his knighthood is of no avail , for that he hath lostthe high queen , the valiant , that heart and comfort gave him and encouragement to do well 
the tears ran down from his comely eyes right amidsthis face and through the ventail , and , had he durstmake other dole , yet greater would it have been 
of the mourning the king made is there nought to speak , for this sorrow resembleth none other 
he holdeth the crown of gold , and looketh full oft at the destier for love of her , for he had given it her 
messire gawain may not stnt of making dole 
certes , saith he , now may i well say that the bestqueen in the world and of mostunderstnding is dead , nor never hereafter shall be none of equal worth 
sir , saith lancelot to the king , so it please you , and messire gawain be willing , i will go back toward cardoil , and help to defend your land to the besti may , for sore is it discounselled , until such time as you shall be come from the graal 
certes , saith messire gawain to the king , lancelot hath spoken well , so you grant him your consent 
that do i with right good will , saith the kind , and i pray him right heartily that he go thither and be guardian of my land and the governance thereof , until such a time as god shall have brought me back 
lancelot taketh leave of the king and goeth his way back , all sorrowing and full of discontent 
incipit 
of lancelot the stry is here silent , and so beginneth another branch of the graal in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
you may well understnd that king arthur is no whit joyful 
he maketh the white destier go after him , and hath the crown of gold full near himself 
they ride until they come to the caste that belonged to king fisherman , and they found it as rich and fair as you have heard told many a time 
perceval , that was there within , made right great joy of their coming , as did all the priest and ancient knights 
perceval leadeth king arthur , when he was disarmed , into the chapel where the graal was , and messire gawain maketh present to perceval of the golden circlet , and telleth him that the queen sendeth it to him , and relateth also how nabigant had seized it , and moreover , how nabigant was dead 
the king offereth the crown that had been queen guenievre s 
when perceval knew that she was dead , he was right sorrowful thereof in his heart , and wept and lamented her right sweetly 
he showeth them the tomb of king fisherman , and telleth them that none had set the tabernacle there above the coffin , but only the commandment of our lord , and he showeth them a rich pall that is upon the coffin , and telleth them that every day they see a new one there not less rich than is this one 
king arthur looketh 
at the sepulchre and saith that never tofore hath he seen none so costy 
a smell issueth therefrom full delicate and sweet of savour 
the king sojourneth in the caste and is highly honoured , and beholdeth the richesse and the lordship and the great abundance that is everywhere in the caste , insomuch that therein is nought wanting that is needful for the bodies of noble folk 
perceval had made set the bodies of the dead knights in a charnel beside an old chapel in the forest and the body of his uncle that had slain himself so evilly 
behind the caste was a river , as the histry testfieth , whereby all good things came to the caste , and this river was right fair and plenteous 
josephus witnesseth us that it came from the earthly paradise and compassed the caste around and ran on through the forestas far as the house of a worshipful hermit , and there lostthe course and had peace in the earth 
all along the valley thereof was great plenty of everything continually , and nought was ever lacking in the rich caste that perceval had won 
the caste , so saith the histry , had three names 
ii 
one of the names was eden , the second , caste of joy , and the third , caste of souls 
now josephus saith that none never passed away therein but his soul went to paradise 
king arthur was one day at the caste windows with messire gawain 
the king seeth coming before him beyond the bridge a great procession of folk one before another 
he that came before was all clad in white , and bare a full great cross , and each of the others a little one , and the more part came singing with sweet voices and bear candles burning , and there was one behind that carried a bell with the clapper and all at his neck 
ha , god , saith king arthur , what folk be these 
sir , saith perceval , i know them all save the last  they be hermits of this forest that come to chant within yonder before the holy graal , three days in the week 
iii 
when the hermits came nigh the caste , the king went to meet them , and the knights adore the crosses and bow their heads before the good men 
as soon as they were come into the holy chapel , they took the bell from the lastand smote thereon at the altar , and then set it on the ground , and then began they the service , mostholy and mostglorious 
the histry witnesseth us that in the land of king arthur at this time was there not a single chalice 
the graal appeared at the sacring of the mass , in five several manners that none ought not to tell , for the secret things of the sacrament ought none to tell openly but he unto whom god hath given it 
king arthur beheld all the changes , the lastwhereof was the change into a chalice 
the hermit that chanted the mass found a brief under the corporal and declared the letters , to wit , that our lord god would that in such vessel should his body be sacrificed , and that it should be set upon record 
the histry saith not that there were no chalices elsewhere , but that in all great britain and in the whole kingdom was none 
king arthur was right glad of this that he had seen , and had in remembrance the name and the fashion of the mostholy chalice 
he asked the hermit that bare the bell , whence this thing came 
sir , saith he to messire gawain , i am the king for whom you slew the giant , whereby you had the sword wherewith stjohn was beheaded , that i see on this altar 
i made baptize me before you and all those of my kingdom , and turn to the new law , and thereafter i went to a hermitage by the sea , far from folk , where i have been of a long space 
i rose one night at matins and looked under my hermitage and saw that a ship had taken haven there 
i went thither when the sea was retreated , and found within the ship three priest and their clerks , that told me their names and how they were called in baptism 
all three were named gregory , and they came from the land of promise , and told me that solomon had castthree bells , one for the saviour of the world , and one for his sweet mother , and one for the honour of his saints , wherefore they had brought this hither by his commandment into this kingdom for that we had none here 
they told me that and i should bear it into this caste , they would take all my sins upon themselves , by our lord s pleasure , in such sort as that i should be quit thereof 
i in like manner have brought it hither by the commandment of god , who willeth that this should be the pattern of all those that shall be fashioned in the realm of this island where never aforetime have been none 
by my faith , saith messire gawain to the hermit , i know you right well for a worshipful man , for you held your covenant truly with me 
king arthur was right glad of this thing , as were all they that were within 
it seemed him that the noise thereof was like the noise that he had heard sound ever since he had moved from cardoil 
the hermits went their way each to his hermitage when they had done the service 
iv 
one day , as the king sate at meat in the hall with perceval and messire gawain and the ancient knights , behold you therewithal one of the three damsels of the car that cometh , and she was smitten all through her right arm 
sir , saith she to perceval , have mercy on your mother and your sistr and on us 
aristr of moraine , that is cousin to the lord of the moors that you slew , warreth upon your mother , and hath carried off your sistr by force into the caste of a vavasour of his , and saith that he will take her to wife and will have all her land that your mother ought to hold of right , maugre your head 
never had knight custm so cruel as he , for when he shall have espoused the damsel , whomsoever she may be , yet will he never love her so well but that he shall cut off her head with his own hand , and so thereafter go seek for another to slay in like manner 
natheless in one matter hath he good custm , that never will he do shame to none until such time as he hath espoused her 
sir , i was with my lady your sistr when he maimed me in this manner 
wherefore your mother sendeth you word and prayeth you that you succour her , for you held her in covenant that so you would do and she should have need thereof and you should know it 
for and you consent to her injury and loss , the shame will be your own 
perceval heard these tidings , and sore sorrowful was he thereof 
by my head , saith the king to perceval , i and my nephew , so please you , will go to help you 
sir , saith he , gramercy , but go and achieve your own affair also , for sore need have you thereof 
wherefore i pray and beseech you that you be guardian of the caste of camelot , if that my lady mother shall come thither , for thereof make i you lord and champion , and albeit the caste be far away from you , yet garnish it and guard it , for it is builded in a place right fair 
v 
lords , think not that it is this camelot whereof these tellers of tales do tell their tales , there , where king arthur so often held his court 
this camelot that was the widow lady s stod upon the uttermostheadland of the wildestisle of wales by the sea to the west  nought was there save the hold and the forestand the waters that were round about it 
the other camelot , of king arthur s , was situate at the entrance of the kingdom of logres , and was peopled of folk and was seated at the head of the king s land , for that he had in his governance all the lands that on that side marched with his own 
title i 
of perceval the stry is here silent , and saith that king arthur and messire gawain have taken leave of perceval and all them of the caste 
the king leaveth him the good destier that he won , with the golden crown 
they have ridden , he and messire gawain together , until they are come to a wast ancient caste that stod in a forest  the caste would have been right fair and rich had any folk wonned therein , but none there were save one old priestand his clerk that lived within by their own toil 
the king and messire gawain lodged there the night , and on the morrow went into a right rich chapel that was therein to hear mass , and it was painted all around of right rich colours of gold and azure and other colours 
the images were right fair that were there painted , and the figures of them for whom the images were made 
the king and messire gawain looked at them gladly 
when the mass was said , the priestcometh to them and saith  lords , saith he , these imagings are right fair , and he that had them made is full loyal , and dearly loved the lady and her son for whom he had them made 
sir , saith the priest it is a true histry 
of whom is the histry , fair sir 
saith king arthur 
of a worshipful vavasour that owned this hold , and of messire gawain , king arthur s nephew , and his mother 
sir , saith the priest messire gawain was born there within and held up and baptized , as you may see here imaged , and he was named gawain for the sake of the lord of this caste that had that name 
his mother , that had him by king lot , would not that it should be known 
she set him in a right fair coffer , and prayed the good man of this caste that he would carry him away and leave him where he might perish , but and if he would not do so , she would make another do it 
this gawain , that was loyal and would not that the child should be put to death , made seal letters at the pillowbere of his cradle that he was of lineage royal on the one side and the other , and set therein gold and silver so as that the child might be nurtured in great plenty , and spread above the child a right rich coverlid 
he carried him away to a far distnt country , and so came one early morning to a little homestad where dwelt a right worshipful man 
he delivered the child to him and his wife , and bade them they should keep him and nurture him well , and told them that it might be much good should come to them thereof 
the vavasour turned him back , and they took charge of the child and nurtured him until that he were grown , and then took him to rome to the holy father , and showed him the sealed letters 
the holy father saw them and understod that he was the son of a king 
he had pity upon him , and gave him to understnd that he was of his kindrd 
after that , he was elected to be emperor of rome 
he would not be emperor lesthe should be reproached of his birth that had before been concealed from him 
he departed thence , and lived afterwards within yonder 
now is it said that he is one of the bestknights in the world , insomuch that none dursttake possession of this caste for drad of him , nor of this great forestthat lieth round about it 
for , when the vavasour that dwelt here was dead , he left to messire gawain , his fostrson , this caste , and made me guardian thereof until such time as messire gawain should return 
ii 
the king looketh at messire gawain , and seeth him stop his head toward the ground for shame 
fair nephew , be not ashamed , for as well might you reproach me of the same 
of your birth hath there been great joy , and dearly ought one to love the place and honour it , where so good a knight as are you was born 
when the priestunderstod that it was messire gawain , he made great cheer to him , and was all ashamed of that he had recorded as concerning his birth 
he saith to him  sir , small blame ought you to have herein , for you were confirmed in the law that god hath estblished and in loyalty of marriage of king lot and your mother 
this thing king arthur well knoweth , and our lord god be praised for that , you have come hither 
title i 
here the stry is silent of the kingdom , and of king arthur and messire gawain that remain in the caste to maintain and guard it until they shall have garnished it of folk 
here speaketh it word of the knight s son of the wast manor , there whither the brachet led messire gawain where he found the knight that lancelot had slain 
he had one son whose name was meliant , and he had not forgotten his father s death 
rather , thereof did wrath rankle in his heart 
he heard tell that briant of the isles had great force and great puissance , and that he warred upon king arthur s land , insomuch as that he had already slain many of his knights 
thitherward goeth he , and is come to where briant was in a caste of his own 
he telleth him how lancelot had slain his father in such sort , and prayeth him right courteously that he would make him knight , for that right fain would he avenge his father , and therefore would he help him in the war the besthe might 
briant made much joy thereof , and made him knight in right costy sort , and he was the comeliestknight and the mostvaliant of his age in briant s court , and greatly did he desire to meet with lancelot 
they marvelled much in the land and kingdom what had become of him 
the more part thought that he was dead , albeit dead he was not , but rather sound and hale and whole , had it not been for the death of queen guenievre , whereof the sorrow so lay at his heart that he might not forget it 
he rode one day amidsta forest and overtook a knight and a damsel that made great joy together , singing and making disport 
by god , saith the damsel , if this knight that cometh here will remain , he shall have right good lodging 
it is already nigh eventide , and never will he find hostl so good today 
damsel 
saith lancelot , of good hostl have i sore need , for i am more than enough weary 
be all they , saith she , that come from the land of the rich king fisherman , for none may suffer the pain and travail and he be not good knight 
ii 
 , damsel , saith lancelot , which is the way to the caste whereof you speak 
sir , saith the knight , you will go by this cross that you see before you , and we will go by that other way , to a certain hold 
haply we shall find you at the caste or ever you depart thence 
lancelot goeth his way and leaveth them 
by my head , saith the damsel to the knight , this that goeth there is lancelot 
he knoweth me not , albeit i know him well , and i hear that he is sore troubled of his sorrow and misease 
natheless , please god , i will have vengeance of him or ever he departeth from the caste whither he goeth to harbour 
he made marry perforce a knight that loved me better than aught beside , and to a damsel that he loved not a whit 
so much might he stll better perceive when he saw that she ate not at his table , but was seated along with the squires , and that none did aught for her at the caste 
the knight will not abandon her for his own honour , and for that i should be blamed thereof 
the evening drweth on and lancelot goeth toward the caste , that was right uneath to find and in an unfrequented part 
he espieth it at the head of the forest and seeth that it is large and stong , with stong barbicans embattelled , and at the entrance of the gateway were fifteen heads of knights hanging 
he found without a knight that came from the forest and asked him what caste it was , and he made answer that it was called the caste of the griffon 
why are these heads hanging at this door 
sir , saith he , the daughter of the lord of the caste is the fairestin the world and that is known in any kingdom , and needs mustshe be offered to wife to all knights that harbour within 
he that can drw a sword that is fixed in a column in the midstof the hall , and fetch it forth , he shall have her of right without forfeit 
iii 
all these have made assay whose heads you see hanging at the door , but never might none of them remove the sword , and on this occasion were they beheaded 
now is it said that none may drw it forth , unless he that drweth be better knight than another , and needs musthe be one of them that have been at the graal 
and you be minded to believe me , fair sir , saith the knight , you will go elsewhither , for ill lodging is it in a place where one mustneeds set body and life in adventure of death , and none ought to be blamed for escaping from his own harm 
sir , the caste is right fell , for it hath underground , at the issue of a cavern that is there , a lion and a griffon that have devoured more than half a hundrd knights 
sir , saith lancelot , it is evening , nor know i how i may go farther this day , for i know not whither i go sith that i know not the places nor the ways of the forest sir , saith the knight , i speak only for your own good , and god grant you depart hence , honour safe 
lancelot findeth the door of the caste all open , and entereth in all armed , and alighteth before the mastrhall 
the king was leaning at the windows , and biddeth stll his horse 
iv 
lancelot is entered into the hall , and findeth knights and damsels at the tables and playing at the chess , but none did he find to salute him nor make him cheer of his coming save the lord only , for such was the custm of the caste 
the lord bade him be disarmed 
sir , saith he , right well may you allow me wear my arms , for they be the fairestgarniture and the richesti have 
sir , saith the lord of the caste , no knight eateth armed within yonder , but he that cometh armed in hither disarmeth himself by my leave 
he may take his arms again without gainsay , so neither i nor other desire to do him a hurt 
with that two squires disarm him 
the lord of the caste maketh bring a right rich robe wherein to apparel him 
the tables were set and the meats served 
the damsel issued forth of her chamber and was accompanied of two knights as far as the hall 
she looketh at lancelot , and seeth that he is a right comely knight , and much liketh her of his bearing and countenance , and she thinketh to herself that sore pity would it be so comely knight should have his head smitten off 
v 
lancelot saluted the damsel and made great cheer , and when they had eaten in hall , forthwith behold you , the damsel where she cometh that lancelot overtook in the forestwith the knight 
sir , saith she to the lord of the caste , you have harboured this night your deadly enemy that slew your brother at the wast manor 
by my faith , saith the lord of the manor , i think not so , for him would i not have harboured , nor will i not believe it for true until such time as i have proved it 
sir , saith he to lancelot , make the demand that the others make 
what is it 
saith lancelot 
see there my daughter 
ask her of me , and if you be such as you ought to be , i will give her to you 
sir , saith lancelot , no knight is there in the world so good but ought to plume him upon having her to wife , so always she were willing , and , so i thought that you would be willing to give her to me , i would willingly ask you 
lancelot spake otherwise than as he thought , for the departing of the queen and the sorrow thereof lay so at his heart that never again might he lean upon any love in the world , neither of dame nor damsel 
he asked his daughter of the knight of the caste , and came before him to save the custm so that he might not have blame thereof 
he showed him the sword that is in the column , all inlaid with gold 
go , saith he , and fulfil the custm , as other knights have done 
what is it 
saith lancelot 
they might not drw forth the sword from this column , and so failed of my daughter and of their lives 
lord god , saith lancelot , defend me from this custm 
he cometh toward the column as fastas he may , and seizeth the sword with both hands 
soon as he touched it , the sword drweth it forth with such a wrench that the column quaked thereof 
the damsel was right joyful thereat , albeit she misdoubted the fellness and cruelty of her father , for never yet had she seen knight that pleased her so much to love as he 
sir , saith the other damsel , i tell you plainly , this is lancelot , the outrageous , that slew your brother 
natheless , is it no lie that he is one of the bestknights of the world , albeit by the stutness of his knighthood and his valour many an outrage hath he done , and more shall he yet do and he escape you , and , so you will believe me , you will never allow him to depart thus 
sith that and you kill him or slay him you will save the life of many a knight 
the daughter of the lord of the caste is sore displeased of the damsel for this that she saith , and looketh at lancelot from time to time and sigheth , but more durstshe not do 
much marvelleth she , sith that lancelot hath drwn the sword forth of the column , that he asketh her not of her father as his own liege woman , but he was thinking of another thing , and never was he so sorrowful of any lady as he was for the queen 
whatsoever thought or desire he may have therein , he telleth the lord of the caste that he holdeth him to his covenant made at such time as the sword was stll fixed in the column 
i have a right not to hold thereto , saith the lord of the caste , nor shall i break not my vow and i fail you herein 
for no man is bound to give his daughter to his mortal enemy 
sith that you have slain my brother , you are my mortal enemy , and were i to give her to you , she ought not to wish it , and were she to grant you her love she would be a fool and a madwoman 
right sorrowful is the damsel or this that she heareth her father say 
she would fain that lancelot and she were in the forest right in the depth thereof 
lancelot had no mind to be as she was thinking 
the lord of the caste made guard the gateway of the caste well , in such sort that lancelot might issue therefrom on no side 
afterward he bade his knights privily that they take heed on their lives that they be all ready on the morrow and all garnished of their arms , for that it was his purpose to smite off lancelot s head and hang it above all the others 
vi 
the daughter of the lord knew these tidings and was right sorrowful thereof , for she thinketh never more to have joy at heart and he shall be slain in such manner 
she sendeth him greeting by her own privy messenger , as she that loveth him better than aught else living in the world , and so biddeth and prayeth him be garnished of his arms , and ready to protect his life , for that her father is fain to smite off his head 
sir , saith the messenger , your force would avail you nought as againstmy lord , for tomorrow there will be a dozen knights all armed at the issue of the gate whereby you entered tonight , and he saith that he purposeth to cut off your head there where he cut the heads off the other knights 
without the gate there will likewise be another dozen knights all armed 
no knight is there in the world so good as that he might issue forth of this caste through the midstof these four and twenty knights , but my lady sendeth you word that there is a cavern under this caste that goeth therefrom underground as far as the forest so that a knight may well pass thereby all armed , but there is therein a lion , the fiercestand mosthorrible in the world , and two serpents that are called griffons , that have the face of a man and the beaks of birds and eyes of an owl and teeth of a dog and ears of an ass and feet of a lion and tail of a serpent , and they have couched them therewithin , but never saw no man beast so fell and felonous 
wherefore the damsel biddeth you go by that way , by everything that you have ever loved , and that you fail her not , for she would fain speak with you at the issue of the cavern in an orchard that is nigh a right broad river not far from this caste , and will make your destier be brought after you underground 
by my head , saith lancelot , and she had not conjured me in such sort , and were it not for love of herself , i would have rather set myself in hazard with the knights than with the wild beast , for far father would i have delivered myself from them , and so i might , than go forth in suchwise 
she sendeth you word , saith the messenger , that so you do not thus , no further trouble will she take concerning you 
she doth it of drad lestshe lose your love 
here behold a brachet that she sendeth you by me that you will carry with you into the cavern 
soon as you shalt see the serpent griffons that have couched them therein , you shall show them this and casther down before them 
the griffons love her as much as one beastmay love another , and shall have such joy and such desire to play with the brachet that they will leave you alone , and have such good will toward you that they will not look at you after to do you any hurt 
no man is there in the world , no matter how well soever he were armed , nor how puissant soever he were in himself , might never pass them otherwise , but he should be devoured of them 
no safeguard may you have as againstthe lion but of god only and your own hardiment 
tell my damsel , saith lancelot , that all her commandment will i do , but this cowardize resembleth none other , that i shall go fight with beast and leave to do battle with knights 
this was then repeated to the damsel , that marvelled her much thereat , and said that he was the hardiestknight in the world 
vii 
lancelot armed him toward daybreak , and had his sword girt , his shield at his neck , and his spear in his hand 
he entered into the cavern , all shamefast and the brachet followeth after , that he deigned not to carry , and so cometh he to the place where the griffons were 
soon as they heard him coming they drss them on their feet , and then writhe along as serpents , then castforth such fire , and so bright a flame amidstthe rock , as that all the cavern is lighted up thereof , and they see by the brightness of light of their jaws the brachet coming 
soon as they have espied her , they carry her in their claws and make her the greatestcheer in the world 
lancelot passeth beyond without gainsay , and espieth , toward the issue of the cavern , the lion that was come from the forestall famished 
he cometh thither right hardily , sword drwn 
the lion cometh toward him , jaws yawning , and claws bared , thinking to fix them in his habergeon , but lancelot preventeth him and smiteth him so stutly that he cutteth off thigh and leg together 
when the lion feeleth himself thus maimed , he seizeth him by the teeth and the claws of his fore feet and rendeth away half the skirt of his habergeon 
thereupon lancelot waxeth wroth 
he castth his shield to the ground and approacheth the lion closer 
he seeth that he openeth his jaws wide to avenge himself , and thrustth his sword the staightesthe may into his gullet , and the lion giveth out a roar and falleth dead 
the damsel , that had come into the cavern , heareth that the lion is dead 
viii 
lancelot issued forth and so cometh into the orchard beside the forest and wiped his sword on the freshness of the green grass 
thereupon behold you the damsel that cometh 
sir , saith she to lancelot , are you wounded in any place 
damsel , nowhere , thank god 
another damsel leadeth a horse into the orchard 
the damsel of the caste looketh at lancelot 
sir , saith the damsel , meseemeth that you are not over joyous 
damsel , saith he , if i be not , i have good right , for i have lostthe thing in the world that mosti loved 
you have won me , saith she , so you remain not here , that am the fairestdamsel in this kingdom , and i have saved you your life for this , that you grant me your love , for mine own would i fain give unto you 
gramercy , damsel , saith lancelot , your love and your good will fain would i have 
neither you nor none other damsel ought not to have affiance in me , and i might so soon set carelessly aside the love to whom my heart owed its obedience , for the worthiness and the courtesy that were lodged in her 
nor never hereafter , so long as i live , shall i love none other in like manner 
wherefore all others commend i to god , and to yourself , as for leavetaking to one at whose service i fain would be 
i say that if you shall have need of me , and so i be in place and free , i will do all i may to protect your honour 
ix 
ha , god 
saith the damsel , how am i betrayed , sith that i am parted from the bestknight in the world 
lancelot , you have done that which never yet no knight might do 
now am i grieved that you should escape on such wise , and that your life hath been saved in this manner by me 
better should i love you mine own dead , than another s living 
now would i fain that you had had your head smitten off , and that it were hanging with the others 
would i solace myself by beholding it 
lancelot took no account of that he heard , for the grief that lay at his heart of the queen 
he mounteth on his horse and issueth forth of the orchard by a postrn gate , and entereth into the forest and commendeth him to god 
the lord of the caste of the griffons marvelleth much that lancelot delayeth so long 
he thinketh that he durstnot come down , and saith to his knights , let us go up and cut off his head , sith that he durstnot come down 
he maketh search for him all through the hall and the chambers , but findeth him not 
he hath gone , saith he , through the cavern , so have the griffons devoured him 
he sendeth the twain mosthardy of his knights to see 
the brachet had returned after the damsel , whereof the griffons were wroth , and they forthwith seized on the two knights that entered into their cavern and slew them and devoured 
x 
when the lord of the caste knew it , he went into the chamber where his daughter was , and found her weeping , and thinketh that it is for the two knights that are dead 
news is brought him that the lion is dead at the issue of the cavern , and thereby well knoweth he that lancelot is gone 
he biddeth his knights follow after him , but none was there so hardy as that he durstfollow 
the damsel was right fain they should go after him , if only they might bring him back to the caste , for so mortally was she taken of his love that she thought of none other thing 
lancelot had her not in remembrance , but only another , and rode on sadly right amidstthe forest and looked from time to time at the rent the lion had made in his habergeon 
he rideth until he is come toward evening to a great valley where was foreston the one side and the other , and the valley stetched onward half a score great leagues welsh 
he looketh to the right , and on the top of the mountain beside the valley he seeth a chapel newly builded that was right fair and rich , and it was covered of lead , and had at the back two quoins that seemed to be of gold 
by the side of this chapel were three houses dight right richly , each stnding by itself facing the chapel 
there was a right fair graveyard round about the chapel , that was enclosed at the compass of the forest and a spring came down , full clear , from the heights of the forestbefore the chapel and ran into the valley with a great rushing 
each of the houses had its own orchard , and the orchard an enclosure 
lancelot heareth vespers being chanted in the chapel , and seeth the path that turned thitherward , but the mountain is so rugged that he could not go along it on horseback 
he alighteth and leadeth his horse after him by the reins until he cometh nigh the chapel 
xi 
there were three hermits therewithin that had sung their vespers , and came over againstlancelot 
they bowed their heads to him and he saluted them , and then asked of them what place was this 
they told him that the place there was avalon 
they make stble his horse 
he left his arms without the chapel and entereth therein , and saith that never hath he seen none so fair nor so rich 
there were within three other places , right fair and seemly dight of rich cloths of silk and rich corners and fringes of gold 
he seeth the images and the crucifixes all newly fashioned , and the chapel illumined of rich colours 
moreover in the midstthereof were two coffins , one againstthe other , and at the four corners four tall wax tapers burning , that were right rich , in four right rich candlestcks 
the coffins were covered with two pails , and there were clerks that chanted psalms in turn on the one side and the other 
sir , saith lancelot to one of the hermits , for whom were these coffins made 
for king arthur and queen guenievre 
king arthur is not yet dead , saith lancelot 
no , in truth , please god 
the body of the queen lieth in the coffin before us and in the other is the head of her son , until such time as the king shall be ended , unto whom god grant long life 
the queen bade at her death that his body should be set beside her own when he shall end 
hereof have we the letters and her seal in this chapel , and this place made she be builded new on this wise or ever she died 
xi 
when lancelot heareth that it is the queen that lieth in the coffin , he is so staitened in his heart and in his speech that never a word may he say 
no semblant of grief dursthe make other than such as might not be perceived , and right great comfort to him was it that there was an image of our lady at the head of the coffin 
he knelt down the nighesthe might to the coffin , as it had been to worship the image , and set his race and his mouth to the stne of the coffin , and sorroweth for her right sweetly 
ha , lady , saith he , but that i drad the blame of the people , never again would i seek to depart from this place , but here would i save my soul and pray for yours 
would it be much recomforting to me that i should be so nigh , and should see the sepulchre wherein your body lieth that had so great sweetness and bounty 
god grant me of your pleasure , that at my death i may stll be anigh , and that i may die in such manner and in such place as that i may be shrouded and buried in this holy chapel where this body lieth 
the night cometh on 
a clerk cometh to the hermits and saith , never yet did no knight cry mercy of god so sweetly , nor of his sweet mother , as did this knight that is in the chapel 
the hermits make answer that knights for the mostpart do well believe in god 
they come to the chapel for him and bid him come thence , for that meat is ready and he should come to eat , and after that go to sleep and rest for it is full time so to do 
he telleth them that as for his eating this day it is strk nought , for a desire and a will hath taken him to keep vigil in the chapel before one of the images of our lady 
no wish had he once to depart thence before the day , and he would fain that the night should lastfar longer than it did 
the good men durstnot force him againsthis will 
they say , rather , that the worshipful man is of good life who will keep watch in such manner throughout the night without drnk or meat , for all that he seemeth to be right weary 
xiii 
lancelot was in the chapel until the morrow before the tomb 
the hermits apparelled them to do the service that they chanted each day , mass for the soul of the queen and her son 
lancelot heareth them with right good will 
when the masses were sung , he taketh leave of the hermits and looketh at the coffin right tenderly 
he commendeth the body that lieth therein to god and his sweet mother 
findeth he without the chapel his horse accoutred ready , and mounteth forthwith , and departeth , and looketh at the place and the chapel so long as he may see them 
he hath ridden so far that he is come nigh cardoil , and findeth the land wastd and desolate , and the towns burnt , whereof is he sore grieved 
he meeteth a knight that came from that part , and he was wounded full sore 
lancelot asketh him whence he cometh , and he saith , sir , from towards cardoil 
kay the seneschal , with two other knights , is leading away messire ywain li aoutres toward the caste of the hard rock 
i thought to help to rescue him , but they have wounded me in such sort as you see 
are they ever so far away 
saith lancelot 
sir , they will pass justnow at the head of this forest and so you are fain to go thither , i will return with you right willingly and help you to the besti may 
lancelot smiteth his horse with the spurs forthwith , and the knight after him , and espieth kay the seneschal , that was bringing messire ywain along at a great pace , and had set him upon a trotting hackney , for so he thought that none would know him 
lancelot overtaketh him and crieth , by my head , kay the seneschal , shame had you enough of that you did to king arthur when you slew his son , and as much more ought you now to have of thus warring upon him again 
he smiteth his horse of his spurs , lance in rest and kay the seneschal turneth toward him , and they mell together with their spears on their shields , and pierce them in such sort that an ellslength of each shaft passeth through beyond 
xiv 
the lances were stong so as that they brastnot 
they drw them back to themselves so stutly and come together so fiercely that their horses stgger and they lose the strrups 
lancelot catcheth kay the seneschal at the passing beyond , in the midstof the breast and thrustth his spear into him so far that the point remained in the flesh , and kay tobrasthis own 
sore grieved was he when he felt himself wounded 
the knight that was wounded overthrew one of the two knights 
kay is on the ground , and lancelot taketh his horse and setteth messire ywain li aoutres thereupon , that was right sore wounded so as that he scarce might bear it 
kay the seneschal maketh his knight remount , and holdeth his sword grasped in his fistas though he had been strk wood 
lancelot seeth the two knights sore badly wounded , and thinketh that and he sty longer they may remain on the field 
he maketh them go before him , and kay the seneschal followeth them behind , himself the third knight , that is right wroth of the wound he feeleth and the blood that he seeth 
lancelot bringeth off his knights like as the wildboar goeth among the dogs , and kay dealeth him great buffets of his sword when he may catch him , and lancelot him again , and so they depart , fencing in such sort 
xv 
when kay the seneschal seeth that he may not harm him , he turneth him back , full of great wrath , and his heart pricketh to avenge him thereof and he may get at him , for he is the knight of the court that mosthe hateth 
he is come back to the caste of the hard rock 
briant of the isles asketh him who hath wounded him in such sort , and he telleth him that he was bringing thither ywain li aoutres when lancelot rescued him 
the king , saith briant , is he repaired thither 
i have heard no tidings of him at all , saith kay , for no leisure had i to ask of any 
briant and his knights take much thought as concerning lancelot s coming , for they are well persuaded that lancelot hath come for that the king is dead and messire gawain , whereof they make right great joy 
kay the seneschal maketh him be disarmed and his wound searched 
they tell him he need not fear it shall be his death , but that he is right sore wounded 
xvi 
lancelot is entered into the caste of cardoil , and his wounded knights withal , and findeth the folk in sore dismay 
great dole make they in many places and much lamentation for king arthur , and say that now nevermore may they look for succeur to none , and he be dead and messire gawain 
they give lancelot joy of that he hath rescued messire ywain li aoutres , and were so somewhat comforted and made great cheer 
the tidings thereof came to the knights that were in the caste , and they all come forward to meet him save they that were wounded , and so led him up to the caste , and messire ywain with him and the other knight that was wounded 
all the knights of the caste were right glad , and ask him tidings of king arthur , and whether he were dead or no 
lancelot telleth them that he was departed from him at the palace meadow , where he won the white destier and the crown of gold there where the tidings were brought to him that queen guinievre was dead 
xvii 
you tell us of a truth that the king is on live , and messire gawain 
both , you may be certain 
saith lancelot 
thereupon were they gladder than before 
they told him of their own mischance , how briant of the isles had put them to the worse , and how kay the seneschal was with him to do them hurt 
for he it is that taketh mostpains to do them evil 
by my head , saith lancelot , kay the seneschal ought of right to take heed and withhold him from doing you ill , but he departed from the field with the point of my spear in him when i rescued messire ywain 
xviii 
the knights are much comforted of the coming of lancelot , but he is much grieved that he findeth so many of them wounded 
meliant of the wast manor is at the caste of the hard rock , and good fellow is it betwixt him and kay the seneschal 
he is right glad of the tidings he hath heard , that lancelot is come , and saith that he is the knight of the world that mosthe hateth , and that he will avenge him of his father and he may meet him 
there come before the caste of cardoil one day threescore knights armed , and they seize upon their booty betwixt the caste and the forest  lancelot issueth forth all armed , and seven of the bestof the caste with him 
he cometh upon them after that they have led away their plunder 
he overtaketh one knight and smiteth him with his spear right through the body , and the other knights make an onset upon the others and many tobrake their spears , and much clashing was there of stel on armour 
there fell at the assembly on one side and the other full a score knights , whereof some were wounded right sore 
meliant of the wast manor espied lancelot , and right great joy made he of seeing him , and smiteth him so stut a buffet on the shield that he tobreaketh his spear 
xix 
lancelot smiteth him amidstthe breastso grimly that he maketh him bend backwards over the saddle behind , and so beareth him to the ground , legs uppermost over his horse s croup , and trampleth him under his horse s feet 
lancelot was minded to alight to the ground to take him , but briant of the isles cometh and maketh him mount again perforce 
the numbers grew on the one side and the other of knights that came from cardoil and from the hard rock 
right great was the frushing of lances and the clashing of swords and the overthrow of horses and knights 
briant of the isles and lancelot come againsteach other so stutly that they pierce their shields and cleave their habergeons , and they thrustwith their spears so that the flesh is broken under the ribs and the shafts are alltosplintered 
they hurtle againsteach other so grimly at the bypassing that their eyes sparkle as it were of strs in their heads , and the horses stgger under them 
they hold their swords drwn , and so return the one toward the other like lions 
such buffets deal they upon their helms that they beat them in and make the fire leap out by the force of the smiting of iron by stel 
meliant cometh all armed toward lancelot to aid briant of the isles , but lucan the butler cometh to meet him , and smiteth him with his spear so stutly that he thrustth it right through his shield and twistth his arm gainsthis side 
he breaketh his spear at the bypassing , and meliant also breaketh his , but he was wounded passing sore 
thereupon he seizeth him by the bridle and thinketh to lead him away , but the knights and the force of briant rescue him 
the clashing of arms lastd great space betwixt briant of the isles and lancelot , and each was mightily wrath for that each was wounded 
either seized other many times by the bridle , and each was right fain to lead the other to his own hold , but the force of knights on the one side and the other disparted them asunder 
thus the stur lastd until evening , until that the night sundered them 
briant had nought to boastof at departing , for lancelot and his men carried off four of his by force right sore wounded , besides them that remained dead on the field 
briant of the isles and meliant betook them back all sorrowful for their knights that are taken and dead 
lancelot cometh back to cardoil , and they of the caste make him right great joy of the knights that they bring taken , and say that the coming of the good knight lancelot should be great comfort to them until such time as king arthur should repair back and messire gawain 
the wounded knights that were in the caste turned to healing of their wounds , whereof was lancelot right glad 
they were as many as five and thirty within the caste 
of all the king s knights were there no more save lancelot and the wounded knight that he brought along with him 
title i 
here the stry is silent of lancelot and the knights that are at cardoil , and saith that king arthur and messire gawain are in the caste where the priesttold messire gawain how he was born 
they cannot depart thence at their will , for  uret the bastrd that was brother of nabigant of the rock , that messire gawain slew on account of meliot of logres , knoweth well that they are therewithin , and hath assembled his knights and holdeth them within so stait that they may not depart without sore damage 
for he hath on the outer side a full great plenty of knights , and the king and messire gawain have with them but only five of the forestand the country that are upon their side , and they hold them so stait within that they may not issue out from thence 
yea , the brother of nabigant sweareth that they shall not depart thence until such time as he shall have taken messire gawain , and taken vengeance on his fellow of his brother whom he slew 
the king saith to messire gawain that he hath much shame of this that they are so long shut up therewithin , and that he better loveth to die with honour than to live with shame within the caste 
they issued forth , spears in rest and  uret and his knights , whereof was there great plenty , made much joy thereat 
ii 
the king and messire gawain stike among them , and each overthroweth his man 
uret hath great shame of this that he seeth his knights put to the worse by so few folk 
he setteth his spear in restand smiteth one of king arthur s knights through the body and beareth him down dead 
returneth he to messire gawain , and buffeteth him so stongly that he pierceth his shield , but he maketh drp his own spear and loseth his strrups , and messire gawain waxeth wroth and smiteth him so grimly and with such force that he maketh him bend back over the hinder bow of his saddle 
uret was stong and of great might , and leapeth back between the bows and cometh toward king arthur that he saw before him , but he knew him not 
he left messire gawain , and the king smiteth him with such a sweep that he cutteth off his arm , spear and all 
there was great force of knights , so that they ran upon them on all sides 
never would they have departed thence sound and whole , but that thereupon meliot of logres cometh thither with fifteen knights , for that he had heard tidings of messire gawain , how he was besieged in a caste there , where he and king arthur between them were in such plight that they had losttheir five knights , so that they were not but only two that defended themselves as bestthey might , as they that had no thought but to remain there , for the odds of two knights againstthirty was too great 
iii 
thereupon , behold you , meliot of logres with fifteen knights , and they come thither where the king and messire gawain are in such jeopardy , and they stike so stutly among them that they rescue king arthur and messire gawain from them that had taken them by the bridle , and so slay full as many as ten of them , and put the others to flight , and lead away their lord sore maimed 
messire gawain giveth meliot much thanks of the bounty he hath done , whereby he hath saved them their lives 
he giveth him the caste , and is fain that he hold it of him , for in no place might he have better employment , and that well hath he deserved it of his service in such need 
meliot thanketh him much , and prayeth messire gawain instntly that and he shall have need of succour he will come to aid him , in like manner as he would do by him everywhere 
messire gawain telleth him that as of this needeth him not to make prayer , for that he is one of the knights of the world that mosthe ought of right to love 
the king and messire gawain take leave of meliot , and so depart , and meliot garnisheth the caste that was right fair and rich and well seated 
title i 
of meliot the stry is here silent , and saith that king arthur and messire gawain have ridden so far that they are come into the isle of avalon , there where the queen lieth 
they lodge the night with the hermits , that made them right great cheer 
you may well say that the king is no whit joyful when he seeth the coffin where the queen lieth and that wherein the head of his son lieth 
thereof is his dole renewed , and he saith that this holy place of this holy chapel ought he of right to love better than all other places on earth 
they depart on the morrow when they have heard mass 
the king goeth the quickesthe may toward cardoil , and findeth the land wastd and desolate in many places , whereof is he right sorrowful , and understndeth that kay the seneschal warreth upon him with the others 
he marvelleth much how he durstdo it 
he is come to cardoil 
when they of the caste know it they come to meet him with right great cheer 
the tidings went throughout all the land , and they of the country were right joyous thereof , for the more part believed that he was dead 
they of the caste of the hard rock knew it , but little rejoiced they thereat 
kay the seneschal was whole of his wound and bethought him that great folly would he do to remain longer there to war upon the king , for well knew he that and the king held him and did that which he had proclaimed , his end were come 
he departeth from the caste , where he had sojourned of a long while , and crossed again stalthily oversea , and came into little britain , and made fasta caste for fear of the king , that is called chinon , and was there long time , without the king warring upon him , for enough adventures had he in other parts 
ii 
to cardoil was the king repaired and messire gawain 
you may well understnd that the land was much rejoiced thereof , and that all the knights were greatly comforted , and knights came back to the court from all parts 
they that had been wounded were whole again 
briant of the isles stnted not of his pride nor of his outrage , but rather strred up the war the mosthe might , he and meliant stll more , and said that never would he cease therefrom until death , nor never would he have restuntil such time as he should have vengeance of lancelot 
the king was one day at cardoil at meat , and there was in the hall great throng of knights , and messire gawain sate beside the king 
lancelot sate at the table , and messire ywain the son of king urien , and sagramors li desirous , and ywain li aoutres , and many more other knights round about the table , but there were not so many as there wont to be 
messire lucan the butler served before the king of the golden cup 
the king looked round about the table and remembered him of the queen 
he was bent upon thinking rather than on eating , and saw that his court was much wastd and worsened of her death 
what time the king was musing in such sort , behold you a knight come into the hall all armed before the king 
he leaneth on the stff of his spear 
sir , saith the knight , listn , so please you , to me , and all these others , listn 
madeglant of oriande sendeth me here to you , and commandeth that you yield up the table round to him , for sith that the queen is dead , you have no right thereof , for he is her next of kin and he that hath the bestright to have and to hold it 
so you do not this , you he defieth as the man that disinheriteth him , for he is your enemy in two manner of ways , for the table round that you hold by wrong , and for the new law that you hold 
he sendeth you word by me , that so you will renounce your belief and take queen jandre his sistr , that he will cry you quit as of the table round and will be of your aid everywhere 
and if you do not this , have never affiance in him 
so sendeth he word to you by me 
iii 
therewith the knight departeth , and the king remaineth all heavy in thought , and when they had eaten , he rose from the tables and all the knights 
he speaketh to messire gawain and lancelot , and taketh counsel with all the others 
sir , saith messire gawain , you will defend yourself the bestyou may , and we will help you to smite your enemies 
great britain is all at your will 
you have not as yet lostany caste 
nought hath been broken down nor burnt but open ground and cottages and houses , whereof is no great harm done to yourself , and the shame thereof may lightly be amended 
king madeglant is of great hardiment as of words , but in arms will he not vanquish you so soon 
if that he warreth upon you toward the west send thither one of the bestknights of your court that may maintain the war and defend the land againsthim 
iv 
the king sojourned at cardoil of a long space 
he believed in god and his sweet mother right well 
he brought thither from the caste where the graal was the pattern whereby chalices should be made , and commanded make them throughout all the land so as that the saviour of the world should be served more worshipfully 
he commanded also that bells be castthroughout his land after the fashion of the one he had brought , and that each church should have one according to the means thereof 
this much pleased the people of his kingdom , for thereby was the land somewhat amended 
the tidings came to him one day that briant and meliant were riding through his land with great routs of folk , and were minded to assiege pannenoisance 
the king issued forth of cardoil with great throng of knights all armed , and rode until he espied briant and his people , and briant him again 
they ranged their battles on both sides , and came together with such might and so great a shock as that it seemed the earth shook 
they melled together at the assembly with their spears so passing grimly as that the frushing thereof might be heard right far away 
me fourteen fell in the assembly that rose up again never more 
meliant of the wast manor searcheth for lancelot in the midstof the stur until he findeth him , and runneth upon him right strdily and pierceth his shield with his spear 
lancelot smiteth him such a sweep amidstthe breast that he thrustth his spear right through his shoulder , and pinneth him so stongly that the shaft is all tobrast and the end thereof remaineth in his body 
meliant , all sticken through as he is , runneth upon him and passeth his spear right through the shield and through the arm , in such sort that he pinneth it to his side 
he passeth beyond and breaketh his spear , and afterward returneth to lancelot , sword in fist and dealeth him a buffet on the helm so grimly that he all tobattered it in 
lancelot waxeth right wroth thereof , and he grieveth the more for that he feeleth him wounded 
he cometh toward meliant , sword drwn , and holding him well under cover of his shield and cover of his helm , and smiteth meliant so fiercely that he cleaveth his shoulder down to the rib in such sort that the end of the spear wherewith he had pierced him fell out therefrom 
meliant felt himself wounded to the death , and drweth him back all sorrowful , and other knights run upon lancelot and deliver assault 
messire ywain and sagramors li desirous and messire gawain were on the other side in great jeopardy , for the people of briant of the isles came from all parts , and waxed more and more , and on all sides the greater number of knights had the upper hand therein 
king arthur and briant of the isles were in the midstof the battle , and dealt each other right great buffets 
briant s people come thither and take king arthur by the bridle , and the king defendeth himself as a good knight , and maketh a ring about him amongstthem that attack him , the same as doth a wild boar amongstthe dogs 
messire ywain is come thither and lucan the butler , and break through the press by force 
thereupon , behold you sagramors li desirous , that cometh as fastas his horse may gallop under him , and smiteth briant of the isles right before his people with such a rush that he beareth him to the ground in a heap , both him and his horse 
briant tobrasthis thigh bone in the fall that he made 
sagramors holdeth sword drwn and would fain have thrustit into his body , when the king crieth to him that he slay him not 
v 
briant s people were not able to succour their lord 
nay , rather , they drw back on all sides , for the stut had lastd of a long space 
they tended the dead and the wounded , of whom were enough on one side and the other 
king arthur made carry briant of the isles to cardoil , and bring along the other knights that his own knights had taken 
right joyous were the folks at cardoil when the king came back 
they bore meliant of the wast manor on his shield to the hard rock , but he scarce lived after 
the king made briant of the isles be healed , and held him in prison of a long while , until briant gave him surety of all his lands and became his man 
the king made him seneschal of all his lands , and briant served him right well 
vi 
lancelot was whole of his wound , and all the knights of theirs 
king arthur was safely stblished , and redoubted and draded of all lands and of his own land like as he wont to be 
briant hath forgotten all that is past and is obedient to the king s commands and more privy is he of his counsel than ever another of the knights , insomuch that he put the others somewhat back , whereof had they much misliking 
the felony of kay the seneschal lay very nigh the king s heart , and he said that and any would take vengeance upon him for the same , greatly would he love him thereof , for so disloyally hath he wrought againsthim that he durstnot let the matter be slurred over 
a sore misfortune is it for the world when a man of so poor estte hath slain so high a man as his son for no misdeed , and that stangers ought by as good right as they that knew him or himself take vengeance upon him thereof , so that others might be adrad of doing such disloyalty 
vii 
briant was feared and redoubted throughout all great britain 
king arthur had told them that they were all to be at his commandment 
one day while the king was at cardoil , behold you a damsel that cometh into the hail and saith unto him  sir , queen jandre hath sent me over to you , and biddeth you do that whereof her brother sent you word by his knight 
she is minded to be lady and queen of your land , and that you take her to wife , for of high lineage is she and of great power , wherefore she biddeth you by me that you renounce the new law and that you believe in the god in whom she believeth , and , so you do not this , you may not have affiance in your land , for king madeglant hath as now made ready his hostto enter into the chief of your land , and hath sworn his oath that he will not end until he shall have passed all the borders of the isles that march upon your land , and shall come upon great britain with all his stength , and so seize the table round that ought to be his own of right 
my lady herself would come hither but for one thing , to wit , that she hath in her such disdain of them that believe in the new law , that she deigneth not behold none of them , for , so soon as she was stblished queen , made she her eyes be covered for that she would not look upon none that were of that believe 
the gods wherein she believeth did so much for her , for that she loveth and worshippeth them , that she may discover her eyes and her face , and yet see not at all , whereof is she right glad , for that the eyes in her head are beautiful and gentle 
great affiance hath she in her brother , that is mighty and puissant , for he hath her in covenant that he will destoy all them that believe in the new law , in all places where he may get at them , and , when he shall have destoyed them in great britain and the other islands , so that my lady might not see none therein , so well is she with the gods wherein she believeth , that she will have her sight again all whole nor until that hour is she fain to see nought viii 
damsel , saith the king , i have heard well that which you tell me of this that you have in charge to say 
tell your lady on my behalf , that the law which the saviour of the world hath estblished by his death and by his crucifixion never will i renounce , for the love that i have in him 
tell her that she believe in god and in his sweet mother , and that she believe in the new law , for by the false believe wherein she abideth is she blinded in such sort , nor never will she see clear until she believe in god 
tell her moreover , i send her word that never more shall there be queen in my land save she be of like worth as was queen guenievre 
i tell you plainly , saith she , that you will have betimes such tidings as that good for you they will not be 
the damsel departeth from cardoil , and cometh back to where the queen was , and telleth her the message king arthur sendeth her 
true , saith she , i love him better than all in the world , and yet refuseth he my will and my commandment 
now may he no longer endure 
she sendeth to her brother king madeglant , and telleth him that she herself doth defy him and he take not vengeance on king arthur and bring him not into prison 
title i 
this histry saith that the land of this king was full far away from the land of king arthur , and that needs musthe pass two seas or ever he should approach the firsthead of king arthur s land 
he arrived in albanie with great force of men with a great navy 
when they of the land knew it , they garnished them againsthim and defended their lands the bestthey might 
they sent word to king arthur that king madeglant was come in such manner into the land , with great plenty of folk , and that he should come presently to succour them or send them a knight so good as that he might protect them , and that in case he doth not so , the land will be lost  when king arthur understod these tidings , it was not well with him 
he asked his knights whom he might send thither 
they say , let him send lancelot thither , for that he is a worthy knight and a kingly , and much understndeth of war , and hath in him as much loyalty as hath ever another that they know 
the king maketh him come before him 
ii 
lancelot , saith the king , such affiance have i in you and in your knighthood , that it is my will to send you to the furthestcorner of my land , to protect it , with the approval of my knights , wherefore i pray and require you that you do your power herein as many a time have you done already in my service 
i will give you in command forty knights 
sir , saith lancelot , againstyour will am i not minded to be , but in your court are there other knights full as good , or better than i , whom you might well send thither 
i would not that you should hold this of cowardize in me , and right willingly will i do your pleasure , for none ought i to serve more willingly than you 
the king giveth him much thanks of this that he saith 
lancelot departeth from the court , and taketh forty knights with him , and so cometh into the land of albanie where king madeglant hath arrived 
when they of the land knew that lancelot was come , great joy had they thereof in their hearts , for ofttimes had they heard tell of him and of his good knighthood 
they were all at his commandment , and received him as their champion and protector 
iii 
king madeglant one day issued forth of his ships to do battle againstlancelot and them of the land 
lancelot received him right stutly , and slew many of his folk , and the more part fled and would fain have drwn them to their ships , but lancelot and his people went after and cut a part of them to pieces 
king madeglant , with as many of his men as he might , betaketh himself to his own ship privily , and maketh put to sea the soonesthe may 
they that might not come to the ships remained on dr land , and were so cut up and slain 
madeglant went his way discomfited 
of ten ships full of men that he had brought he took back with him but two 
the land was in peace and assured in safety 
lancelot remained there of a long space 
they of the country loved him much and gave themselves great joy of his valour and his great bounty , insomuch that mostof them say ofttimes that they would fain have such a knight as was he for king , by the goodwill of king arthur , for that the land is too far away 
and if he would set there a knight or other man that might protect the land , they would take it in right good part , and he should hold the land of him , for they might not safeguard it at their will without a champion , for that land without a lord may but little avail 
they of the land loved lancelot well , as i tell you 
king arthur was at cardoil , and so were his knights together with him 
he thought to be assured in his kingdom and to live peaceably 
what time he sate at meat one day in cardoil , behold you thereupon a knight that cometh before the table round without saluting him 
sir , saith he , where is lancelot 
sir , saith the king to the knight , he is not in this country 
by my head , saith the knight , that misliketh me 
wheresoever he be , he is your knight and of your household 
wherefore king claudas sendeth you word that he is his mortal enemy , and you also , if so be that for love of him you receive him from this day forward , for he hath slain his sistr s son , meliant of the wast manor , and he slew the father of meliant likewise , but the father belongeth not to king claudas 
iv 
meliant was the son of his sistrgerman , wherefore much grieveth he of his death 
sir knight , saith the king , i know not how the covenant may be between them as of this that you tell me , but well know i that king claudas holdeth many a caste that king claudas ought not of right to have , whereof he disherited his father , but meet is it that each should conquer his own right 
so much i tell you plainly , that never will i fail mine own knight and he be such as durstdefend himself of murder , but and if he hath no will to do this , then well may i allow that right be done upon him 
sith that he will not love his own death , neither i nor other ought greatly to love him and he refuse to redrss his wrong 
when lancelot shall know these tidings , i know well that such is his valour and his loyalty that he will readily answer in reason , and will do all that he ought to do to clear himself of such a charge 
sir , saith the knight , you have heard well that i have told you 
once more , i tell you plainly , king claudas sendeth you word that so you harbour his enemy henceforward and in such manner as you have done heretofore , he will be less than pleased with you 
v 
with that the knight departeth , and the king remaineth at cardoil 
he sendeth for briant of the isles , his seneschal , and a great part of his knights , and demandeth counsel of them what he may do 
messire ywain saith that he killed meliant in the king s service , as one that warred upon his land , albeit the king had done him no wrong , and had so made common cause with the king s enemies without demanding right in his court 
nor never had meliant appealed lancelot of murder nor of treason , nor required him of the death of his father 
rather , lancelot slew him in open war , as one that warred upon his lord by wrong 
sir , saith messire ywain to the king , howsoever lancelot might have wrought in respect of meliant , your land ought not to be called to account , for you were not in the kingdom , nor knew not that either had done other any wrong , and therefore say i that king claudas will do great wrong and he bring plaint or levy war againstyou on this account 
messire ywain , saith briant of the isles , matter of common knowledge is it that lancelot slew the lord of the wast manor and meliant his son after the contention that was betwixt king arthur and me 
after that he had slain the father , he ought of right to have taken good heed that he did no wrong to the son , but rather ought he to have sought peace and accord 
vi 
briant , saith messire gawain , lancelot is nor here 
moreover , he is now on the king s business 
well know you that meliant came to you and that you made him knight , and that thereafter he warred upon the king s land without reasonable occasion 
the king was far away from the land as he that made pilgrimage to the graal 
he was told tidings that his land was being put to the worse , and he sent lancelot to protect it 
he accordingly maintained the war as besthe might until such time as the king was returned 
meliant knew well that the king was come back , and that never had he done wrong to none in his court that wished to demand right therein 
he neither came thither nor sent , either to do right or to demand right , whether he did so for despite or whether it was for that he knew not how to do it 
in the meanwhile he warred upon the king , that had never done him a wrong nor refused to do him a right 
lancelot slew him in the king s war and upon his land in defence thereof 
there was peace of the war , as was agreed on between you and the king , but and if any should therefore hold lancelot to blame of the death of meliant , meseemeth that therein is he wrong 
for the others are not held to answer for them that they slew 
and if you wish to say that lancelot hath not slain him with reason , howsoever he may have wrought aforetime in respect of his father , i am ready to maintain his right by my body on behalf of his 
vii 
messire gawain , saith briant of the isles , you will not as at this time find none that will take up your gage on account of this affair , nor ought any to make enemies of his friends , nor ought you to counsel me so to do 
king madeglant warreth upon him and king claudas maketh war upon him also 
they will deliver attacks enough 
i should well allow , for the sake of saving his land and keeping his friends , that the king should suffer lancelot to remain at a distnce from his court for one year , until tidings should have come to king claudas that he had been bidden leave thereof , so as that king arthur might have his good will and his love 
sagramors li desirous leapeth forward 
briant of the isles , saith sagramors , ill befall him that shall give such counsel to a lord or his knight , and the knight have well served his lord , albeit he may have slain in his wars a knight without murder and without treason , that he should give him his leave 
right ill will lancelot hitherto have bestwed his services , and the king on this account give him his leave 
after that , let king claudas come 
let him lay wast and slay , and right great worship shall king arthur have thereof 
i say not this for that lancelot hath need be afeared of king claudas body to body , nor of the bestknight in his land , but many things befall whereof one taketh no heed 
so king arthur give leave to lancelot from his court , it will be counted unto him for cowardize , and neither i nor you nor other knight ought never more to have affiance in him 
lord , saith briant of the isles , better would it avail the king to give lancelot leave for one year , than it would to fight for him ten years and have his land wastd and put to the worse 
viii 
thereupon , behold you 
orguelleux of the launde come , that had not been at the court of a long time , and it had been told him whereof these words were 
briant , saith orguelleux of the launde , evil fare the knight that would fain grieve and harm with their lord them that have served him well 
sith that lancelot is not here , say nought of him that ought not to be said 
the court of king arthur hath been as much renowned and made honoured by lancelot as by ever another knight that is in it , and , but for him , never would his court have been so redoubted as it is 
for no knight is there so cruel to his foes nor so redoubted throughout all great britain as is lancelot , and , for that king arthur loveth you , make him not that he hate his knights , for such four or such six be there in his caste as may depart therefrom without returning , the loss whereof should scarce be made good by us 
lancelot hath well served the king aforetime , and the king well knoweth how much he is worth 
if so be that king claudas purposeth to war on king arthur for lancelot s sake , according as i have heard , without any reason , and king arthur be not more craven than he wont to be , he may well abide his warfare and his stife so treason harm him not 
for so many good knights hath king arthur yet , that none knoweth such knights nor such king in the world beside 
title i 
this stry saith that briant would have been wroth with a will againstorguelleux of the launde , had it not been for the king , and orguelleux againsthim , for orguelleux heeded no danger when anger and illwill carried him away 
therewithal the talk came to an end 
when the king learnt the tidings that madeglant was discomfited and that the land of albanie was in peace , he sent word to lancelot to return back 
they of the land were very sorrowful when he departed , for great affiance had they in his chivalry 
he came back thither where king arthur was 
all they of the land made a great joy , for well loved was he of many , nor were there none that hated him save of envy alone 
they told him the tidings of king claudas , and also in what manner briant had spoken 
lancelot took no notice outwardly , as he that well knew how to redrss all his grievances 
he was at the court of a long while , for that king claudas was about to send over thither some one of his knights 
briant of the isles would fain that the king should have given him his leave , for more he hated him than ever another knight in the court , sith he it was that many a time had harmed him more than any other 
by briant s counsel , king claudas sent his knight to king arthur s court , wherein did he not wisely , for that he thereby renewed a matter whereof afterward came right great mischief , as this title witnesseth 
ii 
madeglant of oriande heard say that lancelot was repaired back , and that the land of albanie was all void save for the folk of the country 
he maketh ready his navy at once and cometh back to the land in great force 
he burneth the land and layeth it wast on every side , and doth far worse therein than he did aforetime 
they of the land sent over to king arthur and told him of their evil plight , warning him that , and he send them not succour betimes , they will leave the land and yield up the castes , for that they might not hold them longer 
he took counsel , the king with his knights , whom he might send thither , and they said that lancelot had already been there and that now another knight should be sent thither 
the king sent thither briant of the isles , and lent him forty knights 
briant , that loved not the king in his heart , came into the land , but only made pretence of helping him to defend it 
one day fell out a battle betwixt madeglant and briant and all their men 
briant was discomfited , and had many of his knights killed 
madeglant and his people spread themselves over the land and laid the towns in ruins and destoyed the castes , that were disgarnished , and put to death all them that would not believe in their gods , and cut off their heads 
iii 
all they of the land and country longed with sorrow for lancelot , and said that had he remained there , the land would not have been thus destoyed , nor might they never have protection of no knight but of him alone 
briant of the isles returned back , as he that would the war againstking arthur should increase on every side , for , what good soever the king may do him , he loveth him not , nor never will so long as he is on live 
no semblant thereof dursthe show , for , sith that the bestof his knights had been slain in the battle , so had he no power on his side , as againstlancelot and the good knights of his fellowship , whereof he would fain that there had been not one 
iv 
king arthur was at cardoil on one day of whitsuntide 
many were the knights that were come to this court whereof i tell you 
the king was seated at meat , and the day was fair and clear , and the air clean and fresh 
sagramors li desirous and lucan the butler served before the king 
what time they had served of the firstmeats , therewithal behold you , a quarrel , like as it had been shot from a crossbow , and stiketh in the column of the hall before the king so passing stong that there was not a knight in the hall but heard it when it stuck therein 
they all looked thereat in great wonderment 
the quarrel was like as it were of gold , and it had about it a many costy precious stnes 
the king saith that quarrel so costy cometh not from a poor place 
lancelot and messire gawain say that never have they seen one so rich 
it stuck so deep in the column that the iron point thereof might not be seen , and a good part of the shaft was also hidden 
thereupon , behold you , a damsel of surpassing great beauty that cometh , sitting on a right costy mule , full well caparisoned 
she had a gilded bridle and gilded saddle , and was clad in a right rich cloth of silk 
a squire followed after her  that drve her mule from behind 
she came before king arthur as staight as she might , and saluted him right worshipfully , and he made answer the besthe might 
sir , saith she , i am come to speak and demand a boon , nor will i never alight until such time as you shall have granted it to me 
for such is my custm , and for this am i come to your court , whereof i have heard such tidings and such witness in many places where i have been , that i know you will not deny me herein 
v 
damsel , tell me what boon you would have of me 
sir , saith she , i would fain pray and beseech you that you bid the knight that may drw forth this quarrel from this column go thither where there is sore need of him 
damsel , saith the king , tell me the need 
sir , saith she , i will tell it you plainly when i shall see the knight that shall have drwn it forth 
damsel , saith the king , alight 
never , please god , shall you go forth of my court denied of that you ask 
lucan the butler taketh her between his arms and setteth her to the ground , and her mule is led away to be stbled 
when the damsel had washen , she was set in a seat beside messire ywain , that showed her much honour and served her with a good will 
he looked at her from time to time , for she was fair and gentle and of good countenance 
when they had eaten at the tables , the damsel prayeth the king that he will hastn them to do her business 
sir , saith she , many a good knight is there within yonder , and right glad may he be that shall drw it forth , for i tell you a right good knight is he , sith that none may achieve this business save he alone 
fair nephew , saith the king , now set your hand to this quarrel and give it back to the damsel 
ha , sir , saith he , do me not shame 
by the faith that i owe you , i will not set my hand forward herein this day , nor ought you to be wroth hereof 
behold , here have you lancelot with you , and so many other good knights , that little worship should i have herein were i to set myself forward before them 
messire ywain , saith the king , set your hand hereto 
it may be that you think too humbly of yourself herein 
sir , saith messire ywain , nought is there in the world that i would not do for you , but as for this matter i pray you hold me excused 
sagramors , and you , orguelleux of the launde , what will you do 
saith the king 
sir , say they , when lancelot hath made assay , we will do your pleasure , but before him , so please you , we will not go 
vi 
damsel , saith the king , pray lancelot that he be fain to set his hand , and then the restshall go after him if needs be 
lancelot , saith the damsel , by the thing that mostyou love , make not mine errand bootless , but set your hand to the quarrel and then will the others do that they ought of right to do 
for no leisure have i to tarry here long time 
damsel , saith lancelot , ill do you , and a sin , to conjure me for nought , for so many good knights be here within , that i should be held for a fool and a braggart and i put myself forward before all other 
by my head , saith the king , not so 
rather will you be held as a knight courteous and wise and good , as now you ought to be , and great worship will it be to yourself and you may drw forth the quarrel , and great courtesy will it be to aid the damsel 
wherefore i require you , of the faith you owe me , that you set your hand thereto , sith that the damsel prayeth you so to do , before the others 
vii 
lancelot hath no mind to disobey the king s commandment 
he remembered that the damsel had conjured him by the thing that mosthe loved 
nor was there nought in the world that he loved so much as the queen , albeit she were dead , nor never thought he of none other thing save her alone 
stndeth he staight upright , doth off his robe , and cometh staight to the quarrel that is fixed in the column 
he setteth his hand thereunto and drweth it forth with a right passing stong wrench , so strdily that he maketh the column tremble 
he giveth it to the damsel 
sir , saith she to king arthur , now is it my devoir to tell you plainly of my errand 
nor might none of the knights here within have drwn forth the quarrel save only he 
you held me in covenant how he that should drw it forth should do that which i shall require of him , and that he might do it , nor will i pray nor require of him nought that is not reason 
needs musthe go to the chapel perilous the swiftesthe may , and there will he find a knight that lieth shrouded in the midstof the chapel 
he will take of the cloth wherein he is shrouded and a sword that lieth at his side in the coffin , and will take them to the caste perilous 
when he shall there have been , he shall return to the caste where he slew the lion in the cavern wherein are the two griffons , and the head of one of them shall he take and bring to me at caste perilous , for a knight there lieth sick that may not otherwise be healed 
viii 
damsel 
saith lancelot , i see that you reckon but little of my life , so only that your wish be accomplished 
sir , saith she , i know as well as you what the enterprise is , nor do i no whit desire your death , for , and were you dead , never would the knight be whole for whose sake you undertake it 
you will see the fairestdamsel that is in any kingdom , and the one that mostdesireth to see you 
so you tarry not , through her shall you lightly get done that you have to do 
see now that you delay it not , but do that is needful swiftly sith that it hath been laid upon you , for the longer you tarry , the greater will be the hazard of mischance befalling you 
the damsel departeth from the court and taketh her leave and goeth her way back as fastas she may , and saith to herself  lancelot , albeit you have these pains and this travail for me , yet would i not your death herein , but of right ought i to rejoice in your tribulation , for into two of the mostperilous places in the world are you going 
greatly ought i to hate you , for you reft me of my friend and gave him to another , and while i live may i never forget it 
the damsel goeth her way , and lancelot departeth from the court and taketh leave of the king and of all the others 
he issueth forth of cardoil , all armed , and entereth into the forestthat is deep , and so goeth forth a great pace , and prayeth god guide him into safety 
title i 
therewithal the stry is silent of lancelot , and saith that briant of the isles is repaired to cardoil 
of the forty knights that he took with him , but fifteen doth he bring back again 
thereof is king arthur right sorrowful , and saith that he hath the fewer friends 
they of the land of albanie have sent to king arthur and told him that and he would not lose the land for evermore he mustsend them lancelot , for never saw they knight that better knew how to avenge him on his enemies and to do them hurt than was he 
the king asketh briant of the isles how it is that his knights are dead in such sort 
sir , saith briant , madeglant hath great force of people , and what force of men soever may run upon them , they make a caste of their navy in such sort that none may endure againstthem , and never did no folk know so much of war as do they 
the land lieth far away from you , and more will it costyou to hold it than it is worth 
if you will believe my counsel , you will trouble yourself no more about it , and they of the country would be well counselled and they did the same 
briant , saith the king , this would be great blame to myself 
no worshipful man ought to be idle in guarding and holding that which is his own 
the worshipful man ought not to hold of things so much for their value as for their honour , and if i should leave the land disgarnished of my aid and my counsel , they will take mine , and will say that i have not heart to protect my land 
even now is it great shame to myself that they have settled themselves there and would fain drw away them of the land to their evil law 
i would fain that lancelot had achieved that he hath undertaken , and i would have sent him there , for none would protect the land better than he , and , were he now there along with forty knights and with them of the country , madeglant would make but short sty there 
sir , saith briant , they of the country reckon nought of you nor any other but lancelot only , and they say that and you send him there they will make him king 
it may well be that they say so , saith the king , but never would lancelot do aught that should be againstmy will 
sir , saith briant , sith that you are not minded to believe me , i will say no more in this matter , but in the end his knighthood will harm you rather than help you and you take no better heed thereof than up to this time you have done 
title i 
of briant of the isles the stry is here silent , whom king the believeth too much in many things , and saith that lancelot goeth his way right through the forest full heavy in thought 
he had not ridden far when he met a knight that was right sore wounded 
he asked him whence he came and who had wounded him in such manner 
sir , saith he , i come from the chapel perilous , where i was not able to defend me againstan evil folk that appeared there 
they have wounded me in such sort as you see , and but for a damsel that came thereinto from the foresti should not have escaped on live 
she aided me on such condition that and i should see a knight they call lancelot , or perceval , or messire gawain , i should tell which of them soever i should firstmeet withal that he should go to her without delay , for much she marvelleth her that none of them cometh into the chapel , for none ought to enter there but good knights only 
much do i marvel , sir , how the damsel durstenter there , for it is the mostmarvellous place that is , and the damsel is of right great beauty 
natheless she cometh thither oftentimes alone into the chapel 
a knight lieth in the chapel that hath been slain of late , that was a fell and cruel knight and a hardy 
what was his name 
saith lancelot 
he was named  uret the bastrd , saith the knight 
he had but one arm and one hand , and the other was smitten off at a caste that messire gawain gave meliot of logres when he succoured him againstthis knight that lieth in the coffin 
meliot of logres hath slain the knight that had assieged the caste , but the knight wounded him sore , so that he may not be whole save he have the sword wherewith he wounded him , that lieth in the coffin at his side , and some of the cloth wherein he is enshrouded 
so god grant me to meet one of the knights , gladly will i convey unto him the damsel s message 
sir knight , saith lancelot , one of them have you found 
my name is lancelot , and for that i see you are wounded and in evil plight , i tell it you thus freely 
sir , saith the knight , now may god protect your body , for you go in great peril of death 
the damsel much desireth to see you , i know not for what , and well may she aid you if she will 
ii 
sir knight , god hath brought us forth of many a peril , and so will he also from this and it be his pleasure and his will 
with that , lancelot departeth from the knight , and hath ridden so far that he is come at evensong to the chapel perilous , that stndeth in a great valley of the forest and hath a little churchyard about it that is well enclosed on all sides , and hath an ancient cross without the entrance 
the chapel and the graveyard are overshadowed of the forest that is right tall 
lancelot entereth therein all armed 
he signeth him of the cross and blesseth him and commendeth him to god 
he seeth in the graveyard coffins in many places , and it seemeth him that he seeth folk round about that talk together , the one with another 
he might not hear that they said 
he might not see them openly , but very tall they seemed him to be 
he is come toward the chapel and alighteth of his horse , and seeth a shed outside the chapel , wherein was provender for horses 
he goeth thither to set his own there , then leaneth his shield againsthis spear at the entrance of the chapel , and entereth in , where it was very dark , for no light was there save only of a single lamp that shone full darkly 
he seeth the coffin that was in the midstof the chapel wherein the knight lay 
iii 
when he had made his orison before an image of our lady , he cometh to the coffin and openeth it as fastas he may , and seeth the knight , tall and foul of favour , that therein lay dead 
the cloth wherein he was enshrouded was displayed all bloody 
he taketh the sword that lay at his side and lifteth the windingsheet to rend it at the seam , then taketh the knight by the head to lift him upward , and findeth him so heavy and so ungain that scarce may he remove him 
he cutteth off the half of the cloth wherein he is enshrouded , and the coffin beginneth to make a crashing so passing loud that it seemed the chapel were falling 
when he hath the piece of the cloth and the sword he closeth the coffin again , and forthwith cometh to the door of the chapel and seeth mount , in the midstof the graveyard as it seemed him , great knights 
horrible , and they are appareled as it were to combat , and him thinketh that they are watching for him and espy him 
iv 
thereupon , behold you , a damsel running , her kirtle girt high about her , right through the graveyard a great pace 
take heed you move not until such time as it is known who the knight is 
she is come to the chapel 
sir knight , lay down the sword and this that you have taken of the windingsheet of the dead knight 
damsel , saith lancelot , what hurt doth it you of this that i have 
this , saith she , that you have taken it without my leave 
for i have him in charge , both him and the chapel 
i would fain , saith she , know what is your name 
damsel , saith he , what would you gain of knowing my name 
i know not , saith she , whether i shall have either loss or gain thereof , but high time already is it that i should ask you it to my sorrow , for many a time have i been deceived therein 
damsel , saith he , i am called lancelot of the lake 
you ought of right , saith she , to have the sword and the cloth 
come you with me to my caste , for oftentimes have i desired that you and perceval and messire gawain should see the three tombs that i have made for your three selves 
v 
damsel , saith he , no wish have i to see my sepulchre so early betimes 
by my head , saith she , and you come not thither , you may not issue from hence without tribulation 
they that you see there are earthly fiends that guard this graveyard and are at my commandment 
never , damsel , please god , saith lancelot , may your devils have power to harm a christan 
ha , lancelot , saith she , i beseech and pray you that you come with me into my caste , and i will save your life as at this time from this folk that are justnow ready to fall upon you 
so you are not willing to do this , yield me back the sword that you have taken from the coffin , and go your way at once 
damsel , saith lancelot , into your caste may i not go , nor desire i to go , wherefore pray me no more thereof , for other business have i to do 
nor will i yield you back the sword , whatsoever may befall me , for a certain knight may not otherwise be healed , and great pity it were that he should die 
ha , lancelot , saith she , how hard and cruel do i find you towards me 
as good cause have i to be sorry that you have the sword as have you to be glad 
for , and you had not had it upon you , never should you have carried it off from hence at your will 
rather should i have had all my pleasure of you , and i would have made you be borne into my caste , from whence never should you nave moved again for nought you might do 
thus should i have been quit of the wardenship of this chapel and of coming thereinto in such manner as now oftentimes i needs mustcome 
vi 
now am i taken in a trap , for , so long as you have the sword , not one of them that are there yonder can do you evil nor hinder you of going 
of this was lancelot not sorry 
he taketh leave of the damsel , that departeth grudgingly , garnisheth him again of his arms , then mounteth again on his horse and goeth his way right through the graveyard 
he beholdeth this evil folk , that were so foul and huge and hideous , it seemed as if they would devour everything 
they made way for lancelot , and had no power to hurt him 
he is issued forth of the graveyard and goeth his way through the forestuntil daylight appeared about him , fair and clear 
he found the hermit there where he had heard mass , then ate a little , then departed and rode the day long until setting of the sun , but could find no hold on the one side nor the other wherein he might lodge , and so was benighted in the forest vii 
lancelot knew not which way to turn , for he had not often been in the forest and knew not how the land lay nor the paths therein 
he rode until he found a little causeway , and there was a path at the side that led to an orchard that was at a corner of the forest where there was a postrn gate whereby one entered , and it was not made fastfor the night 
the orchard was well enclosed with walls 
lancelot entered in and made fastthe entrance , then took off his horse s bridle and let him feed on the grass 
he might not espy the caste that was hard by for the abundance of trees and the darkness of the night , and so knew not whither he was arrived 
he laid his shield for a pillow and his arms at his side and fell on sleep 
had he known where it was he had come , little sleep would he have had , for he was close to the cavern where he slew the lion and where the griffons were , that had come in from the forestall gorged of victual , and were fallen on sleep , and it was for them that the postrn gate had been left unbolted 
a damsel went down from a chamber by a trapdoor with a brachet on her arm for fear of the griffons , and as she went toward the postrngate to lock it , she espied lancelot , that lay asleep in the midstof the orchard 
she ran back to her lady the speediestshe might , and said unto her  up , lady 
saith she , lancelot is sleeping in the orchard 
she leapt up incontinent and came to the orchard there where lancelot was sleeping , then sate her down beside him and began to look at him , sighing the while , and drweth as near him as she may 
fair lord god , saith she , what shall i do 
i wake him firsthe will have no care to kiss me , and if i kiss him sleeping he will awake forthwith 
better hap is it for me to take the mosti may even in suchwise than to fail of all , and , moreover , if so be i shall have kissed him , i may hope that he will not hate me thereof , sith that i may then boastthat i have had at leastso much of that which is his own 
she set her mouth close to him and so kissed him the bestand fairestshe might , three times , and lancelot awakened forthwith 
he leapt up and made the cross upon him , then looked at the damsel , and said  ha , god 
where , then , am i 
fair sweet friend , saith she , you are nigh her that hath all set her heart upon you and will remove it never 
i cry you mercy , damsel , saith lancelot , and i tell you , for nought that may befall , one that loveth me , please god , never will i hate 
that which one hath loved long time ought not so soon to fall away from the remembrance of a love that is rooted in the heart , when she hath been proven good and loyal , nor ought one so soon to depart therefrom 
viii 
sir , saith she , this caste is at your commandment , and you will remain therein , and well may you know my thought towards you 
would that your thought were the same towards me 
damsel , saith he , i seek the healing of a knight that may not be healed save i bring him the head of one of your serpents 
certes , sir , so hath it been said 
i bade the damsel say so only for that i was fain you should come back hither to me 
damsel , saith he , i have come back hither , and so may i turn back again sith that of the serpent s head is there no need 
ha , lancelot , saith she , how good a knight are you , and how ill default do you make in another way 
no knight , methinketh , is there in the world that would have refused me save only you 
this cometh of your folly , and your outrage , and your baseness of heart 
the griffons have not done my will in that they have not slain you or stangled you as you slept , and , so i thought that they would have power to slay you , i would make them come to slay you now 
the devil hath put so much knighthood into you that scarce any man may have protection againstyou 
better ought i to love you dead than alive 
by my head , i would fain that your head were hanged with the others that hang at the entrance of the gateway , and , had i thought you would have failed me in such wise i would have brought my father hither to where you were sleeping , and right gladly would he have slain you 
ix 
none that knoweth the covenant between me and you ought to hold you for a good knight 
for you have cozened me of my right according to the tenor and custm of the caste if that through perversity or slothfulness you durstnot take me when you have won me 
damsel , saith lancelot , you may say your will 
you have done so much for me sithence that i came hither that i ought not to be afeard of you , for traitor is the man or woman that kisseth another to procure his hurt 
lancelot , i took but that i might have , for well i see that none more thereof may i have never again 
he goeth to put the bridle on his destier , and then taketh leave of the damsel , that parteth from him right sorrowfully 
lancelot would no longer tarry , for great throng of knights was there in the caste , and he was not minded to put him in jeopardy for nought 
he issueth forth of the orchard , and the damsel looketh after him as long as she may see him 
after that , cometh she to her chamber , sad and vexed at heart , nor knoweth she how she may bear herself , for the thing in the world that mostshe loveth is far away , and no joy may she have thereof 
x 
lancelot rideth right amidstthe forestuntil it is day , and cometh at the right hour of noon to the caste perilous , where meliot of logres lay 
he entered into the caste 
the damsel that was at king arthur s court cometh to meet him 
lancelot , saith she , welcome may you be 
damsel , saith he , good adventure may you have 
he was alighted at the mountingstge of the hall 
she maketh him mount up the stps and afterward be disarmed 
damsel , saith he , behold , here is some of the windingsheet wherein the knight was shrouded , and here is his sword 
you befooled me as concerning the serpent s head 
by my head , saith the damsel , that did i for the sake of the damsel of the caste of griffons that hateth you not a whit , for so prayed she me to do 
now hath she seen you , and so will she be more at ease , and will have no cause to ask me thereof 
xi 
the damsel leadeth lancelot to where meliot of logres lay 
lancelot sitteth him down before him and asketh how it is with him 
meliot , saith the damsel , this is lancelot , that bringeth you your healing 
ha , sir , welcome may you be 
god grant you health speedily , said lancelot 
ha , for god s sake , saith meliot , what doth messire gawain 
is he hearty 
i left him quite hearty when i parted from him , saith lancelot , and so he knew that you had been wounded in such sort , full sorry would he be thereof and king arthur likewise 
sir , saith he , the knight that assieged them maimed me in this fashion , but was himself maimed in such sort that he is dead thereof 
the wounds that he dealt me are so cruel and so raging , that they may not be healed save his sword toucheth them and if be not bound with some of the windingsheet wherein he was shrouded , that he had displayed about him , all bloody 
by my faith , saith the damsel , behold them here 
ha , sir , saith he , gramercy of this great goodness 
in every way appeareth it that you are good knight , for , but for the goodness of your knighthood , the coffin wherein the knight lieth had never opened so lightly , nor would you never have had the sword nor the cloth , nor never till now hath knight entered therein but either he were slain there , or departed thence wounded right grievously 
they uncover his wounds , and lancelot unbindeth them , and the damsel toucheth him of the sword and the windingsheet , and they are assuaged for him 
he saith that now at lasthe knoweth well he need not fear to die thereof 
lancelot is right joyful thereof in his heart , for that he seeth he will be whole betimes 
sore pity had it been of his death , for a good knight was he , and wise and loyal 
xi 
lancelot , saith the lady , long time have i hated you on account of the knight that i loved , whom you reft away from me and married to another and not to me , and ofttimes have i put myself to pains to grieve you of some ill deed for that you did to me , for never was i so sorrowful for aught that befell me 
he loved me of right great love , and i him again , and never shall that love fail 
now is it far further away from me than it was before , and for this bounty that you have done , never hereafter need you fear aught of my grievance 
damsel , saith lancelot , gramercy heartily 
he was lodged in the caste the night richly and worshipfully , and departed thence on the morrow when he had taken leave of the damsel and meliot , and goeth back a great pace toward the court of king arthur , that was sore dismayed , for madeglant was conquering his islands and great part of his land 
the more part of the lands that he conquered had renounced the new law for fear of death and held the false believe 
messire gawain and many other knights were departed from king arthur s court for that the king trustd more in briant of the isles than he did in them 
xiii 
for many times had king arthur sent knights againstmadeglant since lancelot was departed from the court , to the intent that they should put to rebuke the enemies of his land , but never saw he one come back from thence nought discomfited 
the king of oriande made much boastthat he would fulfil for his sistr all that she had bidden him , for he thought that king arthur would yield himself up betimes unto him and yield all his land likewise 
the king greatly desired the return of lancelot , and said ofttimes that and he had been againsthis enemies as nigh as the others he had sent they would not have durstso to fly againsthim 
in the midstof the dismay wherein was king arthur , lancelot returned to the court , whereof was the king right joyous 
lancelot knew that messire gawain and messire ywain were not there , and that they held them aloof from the court more willingly than they allowed on account of briant of the isles , that king arthur believed in more than ever a one of the others 
he was minded to depart in like sort , but the king would not let him , but said to him rather , lancelot , i pray and beseech you , as him that i love much , that you set your pains and your counsel on defending my land , for great affiance have i in you 
sir , saith lancelot , my aid and my force shall fail you never 
take heed that yours fail not me 
of right ought i not to fail you , saith the king , nor will i never , for i should fail myself thereby 
xiv 
the histry saith that he gave lancelot forty knights in charge , and that he is come into an island where king madeglant was 
or ever he knew of his coming , lancelot had cut off his retreat , for he cut his cables and beat his anchors to pieces and broke up his ships 
after that , he stuck among the people of madeglant , and slew as many of them as he would , he and his knights 
the king thought to withdrw him back , both him and his fellowship , into safety as he wont , but he found himself right ill bestd 
lancelot drve him toward the sea , whither he fled , but only to find himself no less discomfit there , and slew him in the midstof his folk , and all his other knights were slain and castinto the sea 
this island was freed of him by lancelot , and from thence he went to the other islands that madeglant had conquered and set again under the false law , and there did away the false law from them that had been set thereunder by fear of death , and stblished the land in such sort as it had been tofore 
he roved so long from one island to another that presently he came to albanie where he had succoured them at first xv 
when they of the land saw him come , they well knew that the king of oriande was dead and the islands made free , whereof made they great joy 
the land was some deal emptied of the mostpuissant and the stongest for they were dead along with their lord 
lancelot had brought with him some of the bestknights and mostpuissant 
he was come with a great navy into the land and began to destoy it 
they of the land were misbelievers , for they believed in false idols and in false images 
they saw that they might not defend the land , sith that their lord was dead 
the more part let themselves be slain for that they would not renounce the evil law , and they that were minded to turn to god were saved 
the kingdom was right rich and right great that lancelot conquered and attorned to the law of our lord in such wise 
he made break all the false images of copper and fatten wherein they had believed tofore , and whereof false answers came to them of the voices of devils 
thereafter he caused be made crucifixes and images in the likeness of our lord , and in the likeness of his sweet mother , the better to confirm them of the kingdoms in the law 
xvi 
the stongestand mostvaliant of the land assembled one day and said that it was high time a land so rich should no longer be without a king 
they all agreed and came to lancelot and told him how they would fain that he should be king of the realm he had conquered , for in no land might he be better employed , and they would help him conquer other realms enow 
lancelot thanked them much , but told them that of this land nor of none other would he be king save by the good will of king arthur only 
for that all the conquesthe had made was his , and by his commandment had he come thither , and had given him his own knights in charge that had helped him to reconquer the lands 
xvii 
king claudas had heard tell how lancelot had slain the king of oriande and that none of the islands might scarce be defended againsthim 
he had no liking of him , neither of his good knighthood nor of his conquest for well remembered he of the land that he had conquered from king ban of benoic that was lancelot s father , and therefore was he sorry of the good knighthood whereof lancelot was everywhere held of worth and renown , for that he was tenant of his father s land 
king claudas sent a privy message to briant and bore him on hand that , and he might do so much as that king arthur should forbid lancelot his court , and that it were ill with him with the king , he would have much liking thereof and would help him betimes to take vengeance on his enemies , for , so lancelot were forth of his court , and messire gawain , the restwould scarce abide long time , and thus should they have all their will of king arthur s land 
briant sent word back to king claudas that messire gawain and messire ywain began to hold them aloof from the court , and that as for mostpart of the other he need not trouble him a whit , for he might so deal as that in short time lancelot should be well trounced , would they or nould they 
xviii 
tidings are come to king arthur s court that the king of oriande is dead and his people destoyed , and that lancelot hath conquered his kingdom and slain the king , and reconquered all the lands wherein he had set the false law and the false believe by his force and by drad of him 
the more part say in the court that they of the realm of oriande nor those of the other islands will not let lancelot repair to court , and are doing their endeavour to make him king 
nought is there in the world , and he command them , they will not do , and that never was no folk so obedient to any as are they of all these lands to him 
briant of the isles cometh one day privily to king arthur , and saith  sir , saith he , much ought i to love you , for that you have made me seneschal of your land 
whereby meseemeth you have great affiance in me , and my bounden duty is it to turn aside that which is evil from you and to set forward your good everywhere , and , did i not so , no whit loyal should i be towards you 
xix 
tidings are come to me of late that they of the kingdom of oriande and albanie and of the other islands that are your appanages have all leagued together , and have sworn and given surety that they will aid one another againstyou , and they are going presently to make lancelot their king , and will come down upon your land as speedily as they may wheresoever he may dare lead them , and they have sworn their oath that they will conquer your kingdom justas you now hold it , and , so you be not garnished againstthem betimes , you may have thereof sore trouble to your own body as well as the loss whereof i tell you 
by my head , saith the king , i believe not that lancelot durstthink this , nor that he would have the heart to do me evil 
by my head , saith briant , long time have i had misgivings both of this and of him , but one ought not to tell one s lord all that one knows , for that one cannot be sure either that it be not leasing or that folk wish to meddle in his affairs out of envy 
nought is there in the world that i will conceal from you henceforward for the love that you bear me and for that you have affiance in me , and so may you well have , for i have abandoned my land for you that marched with your own , whereby you may sorely staiten your enemies , for well you know that in your court is there no knight of greater puissance than am i 
by my head , saith the king , i am fain to love you and hold you dear , nor shall you never be removed from my love nor from my service for nought that may be said of any , so manifesty have i seen your goodness and your loyalty 
i will bid lancelot by my letters and under my seal that he come to speak with me , for sore need have i thereof , and when he shall be here we will take account of this that you have told me , for this will i not , that he nor none other that may be my knight shall dare rise in arms againstme , for such power ought lord of right to have over his knight , and to be feared and draded of him , for elsewise is he feeble , and lordship without power availeth nought 
the king sent his letters by his messenger to lancelot 
the messenger sought him until he found him in the kingdom of oriande , and delivered him the letters and the seal of the king 
soon as he knew that which the letters say , he took leave of them of the land , that were right sorrowful 
he departed thence and came back to cardoil , bringing with him all the knights that he had in charge , and told the king that he had reconquered for him all the islands , and that the king of oriande was dead and that his land was attorned to the law of our lord 
the king bade briant of the isles that he should make forty knights come armed under their cloaks ready to take lancelot prisoner as soon as he should command them 
the tidings come to lancelot , there where he was in his hostl , that the king had made knights come all armed to the palace 
lancelot bethought him that some need had arisen and that he would arm himself likewise , so he made him be armed and came to the hall where the king was 
sir , saith briant , lancelot thinketh him of something , for he hath armed himself at his hostl , and is come hither in such manner and at such time without your leave , and he may do something more yet 
you ought well to ask him wherefore he wisheth to do you evil , and in what manner you have deserved it 
he biddeth him be called before him 
lancelot , saith the king , wherefore are you armed 
sir , i was told that knights had come in hither armed , and i was feared lestsome mishap had befallen you , for i would not that any evil should betide you 
you come hither for another thing , saith the king , according to that i have been given to wit , and , had the hall been void of folk , you hoped to have slain me 
the king commandeth him be taken forthwith without gainsay of any 
the knights that were armed did off their cloaks and leapt toward him on all sides , for they durstnot disobey the king s commandment , and the more part were men of briant of the isles 
lancelot seeth them coming towards him with their keen swords and saith , by my head , an evil guerdon do you return me of the services i have done for you 
the knights come to him all together swords drwn , and run upon him all at once 
he goeth defending himself , as far as the wall of the hall , whereof he maketh a caste to his back , but before he cometh thither he hath slain or wounded seven 
he began to defend himself right stutly on all sides , but they gave him great buffets of their swords , and no fair play is it of thirty or forty blows to one 
nor ought none believe that one single knight might deliver himself from so many men , seeing that they were eager to take him and do him a hurt 
lancelot defended him the besthe might , but the numbers were againsthim , and , anyway , or ever he let himself be taken he sold himself right dear , for of the forty knights he harmed at leasta score , and of them was none that was not sore wounded and the mostpart killed 
he caught briant of the isles , that was helping to take him , so sore that he made his sword drnk the blood of his body , in such sort that the wound was right wide 
the knights laid hold on lancelot on all sides , and the king commanded that none should harm him , but that they should bring him to his dungeon in the prison 
lancelot marvelled him much wherefore the king should do this , nor might he understnd wherefore this hatred was come so lately 
he is put in the prison so as the king hath commanded 
all they of the court are sorry thereof , save briant and his knights , but well may he yet aby it dear , so god bring lancelot out or prison 
me say , now is the king s court lost sith that messire gawain and the other knights have thus forsaken it , and lancelot is put in prison for doing well , ill trustmay the others have therein 
they pray god yet grant briant of the isles an evil guerdon , for well know they that all this is of his procurement 
of an evil guerdon shall he not fail so god protect lancelot and bring him forth of prison 
title i 
thereupon the stry is silent of lancelot , and cometh back to perceval that had not heard these tidings , and if he had known them , right sorrowful would he have been thereof 
he is departed from his uncle s caste that he hath reconquered , and was sore grieved of the tidings that the damsel that was wounded brought him of his sistr that aristr had carried away by force to the house of a vavasour 
he was about to take her to wife and cut off her head on the day of the new year , for such was his custm with all them that he took 
perceval rideth one day , all heavy in thought , and taketh his way as fastas he may toward the hermitage of his uncle king hermit 
he is come thither on an eventide , and seeth three hermits issued forth of the hermitage 
he alighteth and goeth to meet them so soon as he seeth them 
sir , say the hermits , enter not in , for they are laying out a body there 
who is it 
saith perceval 
sir , say the hermits , it is the good king pelles that aristr slew suddenly after mass on account of one of his nephews , perceval , whom he loveth not , and a damsel is laying out the body there within 
when perceval heard the news or his uncle that is dead , thereof was he right grieved at heart , and on the morrow was he at his uncle s burial 
when mass was sung , perceval would have departed , as he that had great desire to take vengeance on him that had done him such shame 
ii 
thereupon behold you the damsel that is his 
sir , saith she , full long time have i been seeking you 
behold here the head of a knight that i carry hanging at the bow of my saddle , in this rich casket of ivory that you may see , and by none ought he to be avenged but by you alone 
discharge me thereof , fair sir , of your courtesy , for i have carried it too long a time , and this king arthur knoweth well and messire gawain , for each hath seen me at court along with the head , but they could give me no tidings of you , and my caste may i not have again until such time as he be avenged 
who , then , was the knight , damsel 
saith perceval 
sir , he was son of your uncle bruns brandalis , and were he on live , would have been one of the bestknights in the world 
who slew him , damsel 
saith perceval 
sir , the knight of the deep forestthat leadeth the lion , foully in treason there where he thought him safe 
for had he been armed in like manner as was the other , he would not have slain him 
damsel , said perceval , this grieveth me that he hath slain him , and it grieveth me likewise of mine uncle king hermit , whom i would avenge more willingly than all the men in the world , for he was slain on my account 
iii 
mostdisloyal was this knight , and foully was he fain to avenge him when he slew a holy man , a hermit that never wished him ill on account of me and of none other 
right glad shall i be and i may find the knight , and so , methinketh , will he be of me , for me he hateth as much as i do him , as i have been told , and lord god grant , howsoever he may take it , that i may find him betimes 
sir , saith the damsel , so outrageous a knight is he that no knight is there in the world so good but he thinketh himself of more worth than he , and sith that he hateth you with a will , and he knew that you were here , you and another , or you the third , he would come now at once , were he in place and free 
damsel , saith perceval , god give him mischief of his coming , come whensoever he may 
sir , saith she , the deep forestthere , where the red knight leadeth the lion , is towards the caste of aristr , and , or ever you come by adventure into the forest you may well hear some tidings of him 
incipit 
here beginneth the lastbranch of the graal in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost title i 
the stry saith that perceval went his way through the forest  he saw pass before him two squires , and each carried a wild deer trussed behind him that had been taken by hounds 
perceval cometh to them a great pace and maketh them abide 
lords , saith he , whither will you carry this venison 
sir , say the squires , to the caste of arist , whereof aristr is lord 
is there great throng of knights at the caste 
saith perceval 
sir , say the squires , not a single one is there , but within four days will be a thousand there , for messire is about to marry , whereof is great preparation toward 
he is going to take the daughter of the widow lady , whom he carried off by force before her caste of camelot , and hath set her in the house of one of his vavasours until such time as he shall espouse her 
we are right sorrowful , for she is of mostnoble lineage and of great beauty and of the mostworth in the world 
is it great dole that he shall have her , for he will cut her head off on the day of the new year , sith that such is his custm 
one might carry her off , saith perceval , would he not do well therein 
yea , sir 
say the squires , our lord god would be well pleased thereof , for such cruelty is the greatestthat ever any knight may have 
moreover , he is much blamed of a good hermit that he hath slain , and every day desireth he to meet the brother of the damsel he is about to take , that is one of the bestknights in the world 
he saith that he would slay him more gladly than ever another knight on live 
where is your lord 
saith perceval , can you give me witting 
yea , sir , say the squires , we parted from him but now in this forest where he held melly with a knight that seemeth us to be right worshipful and valiant , and saith that he hath for name the knight hardy 
for that he told aristr that he was a knight of perceval s and of his fellowship , he ran upon him , and then commanded us to come on , and said that he should vanquish him incontinent 
we could stll hear justnow the blows of the swords yonder where we were in the forest and aristr is of so cruel conditions that no knight may pass through this forest but he is minded to slay him 
ii 
when perceval heard these tidings , he departed from the squires , and so soon as they were out of sight he goeth as great pace thither as they had come thence 
he had ridden half a league welsh when he heard the buffets they were dealing one another on the helm with their swords , and right well pleased was he for that the knight hardy held so long time melly with aristr in whom is there so much cruelty and felony 
perceval knew not to what mischief the knight hardy had been wounded through the body of a spear , so that the blood rayed out on all sides 
aristr had not remained whole , for he was wounded in two places 
soon as perceval espied them , he smiteth his horse of his spurs , lance in rest and smiteth aristr right through the breastwith such force that he maketh him lose his strrups and lie down backwards over the hinder bow of the saddle 
after that saith he  i am come to my sistr s wedding , of right ought it not to be made without me 
iii 
aristr , that was full hardy , set himself again betwixt the bows of the saddle in great wrath when he seeth perceval , and cometh towards him like as if he were wood mad , sword in hand , and dealeth him such a buffet on the helm as that it is all dinted in thereby 
the knight hardy drweth back when he seeth perceval , for he is wounded to the death through the body 
he had held the stut so long time that he could abide no more 
or ever he departed , he had wounded aristr in two places right grievously 
perceval felt the blow that was heavy , and that his helmet was dinted in 
he cometh back to aristr and smiteth him so passing stongly that he thrustth the spear right through his body and overthroweth him and his horse all of a heap 
he alighteth over him and taketh off the coif of his habergeon and unlaceth his ventail 
what have you in mind to do 
i will cut off your head , said perceval , and present it to my sistr whom you have failed 
do not so 
saith aristr , but let me live , and i will forgo my hatred 
your hatred might i well abide henceforward , meseemeth , saith perceval , but one may not abide you any longer , for well have you deserved this , and god willeth not to bear with you 
he smiteth off his head incontinent and hangeth it at his saddle bow , and cometh to the knight hardy , and asketh him how it is with him 
sir , saith he , i am very nigh my death , but i comfort me much of this that i see you tofore i die 
perceval is remounted on his horse , then taketh his spear and leaveth the body of the knight in the midstof the launde , and so departeth forthwith and leadeth the knight hardy to a hermitage that was hard by there , and lifteth him down of his horse as speedily as he may 
after that , he disarmed him and made him confess to the hermit , and when he was shriven of his sins and repentant , and his soul had departed , he made him be enshrouded of the damsel that followed him , and bestwed his arms and his horse on the hermit for his soul , and the horse of aristr likewise 
iv 
when mass had been sung for the knight that was dead , and the body buried , perceval departed 
sir , saith the damsel that followed him , even now have you much to do 
of this cruel knight and felonous you have avenged this country 
now , god grant you find betimes the red knight that slew your uncle s son 
i doubt not but that you will conquer him , but great misgiving have i of the lion , for it is the cruellestbeastthat saw i ever , and he so loveth his lord and his horse as never no beastloved another so much , and he helpeth his lord right hardily to defend him 
v 
perceval goeth toward the great deep forestwithout tarrying , and the damsel after 
or ever he came thither , he met a knight that was wounded right sore , both he and his horse 
ha , sir , saith he to perceval , enter not into this forest whence i have scarce escaped with much pains 
for therein is a knight that had much trouble of rescuing me from his lion 
no less am i in drad to pass on forward , for there is a knight that is called aristr , that without occasion runneth upon the knights that pass through the forest of him , saith the damsel , need you have no fear , for you may see his head hanging at the knight s saddlebow 
vi 
certes , saith the knight , never yet was i so glad of any tidings i have heard , and well know i that he that slew him is not lacking of great hardiment 
the knight departeth from perceval , but the lion had wounded his horse so passing sore in the quarters that scarce could he go 
sir knight , saith perceval , go to the hermit in the deep forest and say i bade him give you the destier i left with him , for well i see that you have sore need thereof , and you may repay him in some other manner , for rather would he have something else than the horse 
the knight goeth him much thanks of this that he saith 
he cometh to the hermit the besthe may , and telleth him according as he had been charged , and the hermit biddeth him take which destier he will for the love of the knight that had slain the evildoer , that did so many evil deeds in this forest and i will lend you them both twain if you will 
sir , saith the knight , i ask but for one of them 
he taketh aristr s horse , that seemed him the better , and staightway mounteth thereon , and abandoneth his own , that might go no further 
he taketh leave of the hermit , and telleth him he will right well repay him , but better had it befallen him and he had not taken the horse , for thereof was he slain without reason thereafter 
a knight that was of the household of aristr overtook him at the corner of the forest and knew his lord s horse and had heard tell that aristr was dead , wherefore he went into the forestto bury him 
he smote the knight through the body with his spear and so slew him , then took the horse and went away forthwith 
had perceval known thereof , he would have been little glad , for that he asked the knight to go for the horse , but he did it only for the best and for that he rode in great misease 
vii 
perceval goeth toward the deep forest that is full broad and long and evil seeming , and when he was entered in he had scarce ridden a space when he espied the lion that lay in the midstof a launde under a tree and was waiting for his mastr , that was gone afar into the forest and the lion well knew that justthere was the way whereby knights had to pass , and therefore had abided there 
the damsel drweth her back for fear , and perceval goeth toward the lion that had espied him already , and came toward him , eyes on fire and jaws yawning wide 
perceval aimeth his spear and thinketh to smite him in his open mouth , but the lion swerved aside and he caught him in the foreleg and so dealt him a great wound , but the lion seizeth the horse with his claws on the croup , and rendeth the skin and the flesh above the tail 
the horse , that feeleth himself wounded , catcheth him with his two hinder feet or ever he could get away , so passing stongly that he breaketh the mastrteeth in his jaw 
the lion gave out a roar so loud that all the forestresounded thereof 
the red knight heareth his lion roar , and so cometh thither a great gallop , but , or ever he was come thither , perceval had slain the lion 
when the knight saw his lion dead , right sorry was he thereof 
by my head , saith he to perceval , when you slew my lion you did it as a traitor 
you , saith perceval , adjudged your own death when you slew my uncle s son , whose head this damsel beareth 
perceval cometh againsthim without more words , and the knight in like manner with a great rushing , and breaketh his spear upon his shield 
perceval smiteth him with such force that he thrustth his spear right through his body and beareth him to the ground dead beside his horse 
perceval alighteth of his own when he hath slain the knight , and then mounteth him on the red knight s horse for that his own might carry him no longer 
viii 
sir , saith the damsel , my caste is in the midstof this forest that the red knight reft away from me long ago 
i pray you now come with me thither that i may be assured thereof in such sort as that i may have it again wholly 
damsel , saith perceval , this have i no right to deny you 
they ride amidstthe forestso long as that they come to the caste where the damsel ought to be 
it stod in the fairestplace of all the forest and was enclosed of high walls battlemented , and within were fairwindowed halls 
the tidings were come to the caste that their lord was dead 
perceval and the damsel entered in 
he made the damsel be assured of them that were therein , and made them yield up her caste that they well knew was hers of right inheritance 
the damsel made the head be buried that she had carried so long , and bade that every day should mass be done within for the soul of him 
when perceval had sojourned therein as long as pleased him , he departed thence 
the damsel thanked him much of the bounty he had done her as concerning the caste that she had again by him , for never again should it be reconquered of another , as well she knew 
ix 
josephus telleth us in the scripture he recordeth for us , whereof this histry was drwn out of latin into romance , that none need be in doubt that these adventures befell at that time in great britain and in all the other kingdoms , and plenty enow more befell than i record , but these were the mostcertain 
the histry saith that perceval is come into a hold , there where his sistr was in the house of a vavasour that was a right worshipful man 
each day the damsel made great dole of the knight that was to take her , for the day was already drwing somewhat nigh , and she knew not that he was dead 
full often lamented she the widow lady her mother , that in like sort made great dole for her daughter 
the vavasour comforted the damsel right sweetly and longed for her brother perceval , but little thought he that he was so near him 
perceval is come to the hold all armed , and alighteth at the mountingstge before the hall 
the vavasour cometh to meet him , and marvelleth much who he is , for the more part believed that he was one of aristr s knights 
sir , saith the vavasour , welcome may you be 
good adventure may you have , sir 
saith perceval 
he holdeth aristr s head in his hand by the hair , whereof the vavasour marvelled much that he should carry a knight s head in suchwise 
perceval cometh to the mastrchamber of the hall , where his sistr was , that bewailed her right sore 
x 
damsel , saith he to his sistr , weep not , for your wedding hath failed 
you may know it well by this token 
he throweth the head of aristr before her on the ground , then saith unto her  behold here the head of him that was to take you 
the damsel heareth perceval her brother that was armed , and thereby she knoweth him again 
she leapeth up and maketh him the greatestjoy that ever damsel made to knight 
she knoweth not what to do 
joyful is she , that all have pity on her that see her of her weeping for the joy that she maketh of her brother 
the stry saith that they sojourned therewithin and that the vavasour showed them much honour 
the damsel made castthe knight s head into a river that ran round about the hold 
the vavasour was right glad of his death for the great felony that he had in him , and for that needs mustthe damsel die in less than a year and she had espoused him 
xi 
when perceval had been therein as long as it pleased him , he thanked the vavasour much of the honour he had done him and his sistr , and departed , he and his sistr along with him on the mule whereon she had been brought thither 
perceval rode so long on his journeys that he is come to camelot and findeth his mother in great dole for her daughter that should be queen , for she thought surely that never should she see her more 
full sorrowful was she moreover of her brother , the king hermit that had been killed in suchwise 
perceval cometh to the chamber where his mother was lying and might not stnt of making dole 
he taketh his sistr by the hand and cometh before her 
soon as she knoweth him she beginneth to weep for joy , and kisseth them one after the other 
fair son , saith she , blessed be the hour that you were born for by you all my great joy cometh back to me 
now well may i depart , for i have lived long enow 
lady , saith he , your life ought to be an offence to none , for to none hath it ever done ill , but , please god , you shall not end in this place , but rather you shall end in the caste that was your cousin s german , king fisherman , there where is the mostholy graal and the sacred hallows are 
fair son , saith she , you say well , and there would i fain be 
lady , saith he , god will provide counsel and means whereby you shall be there 
my sistr , and she be minded to marry , will we set in good place , where she may live worshipfully 
certes , fair brother , saith she , none shall i never marry , save god alone 
fair son , saith the widow lady , the damsel of the car goeth to seek you , and i shall end not until such time as she hath round you 
lady , saith he , in some place will she have tidings of me and i of her 
fair son , saith the lady , the damsel is here within that the felonous knight wounded through the arm , that carried of your sistr , but she is healed 
lady , saith he , i am well avenged 
he telleth her all the adventures until the time when he reconquered the caste that was his uncle s 
he sojourned long time with his mother in the caste , and saw that the land was all assured and peaceable 
he departed thence and took his leave , for he had not yet achieved all that he had to do 
his mother remained long time , and his sistr , at camelot , and led a good life and a holy 
the lady made make a chapel right rich about the sepulchre that lay between the forestand camelot , and had it adorned of rich vestents , and stblished a chaplain that should sing mass there every day 
sithence then hath the place been so builded up as that there is an abbey there and folk of religion , and many bear witness that there it is stll , right fair 
perceval was departed from camelot and entered into the great forest and so rode of a long while until he had left his mother s caste far behind , and came toward evening to the hold of a knight that was at the head of the forest  he harboured him therein , and the knight showed him much honour and made him be unarmed , and brought him a robe to do on 
perceval seeth that the knight is a right simple man , and that he sigheth from time to time 
xii 
sir , saith he , meseemeth you are not over joyous 
certes , sir , saith the knight , i have no right to be , for a certain man slew mine own brother towards the deep forestnot long since , and no right have i to be glad , for a worshipful man was he and a loyal 
fair sir , saith perceval , know you who slew him 
fair sir , it was one of aristr s knights , for that he was sitting upon a horse that had been aristr s , and whereon another knight had slain him , and a hermit had lent him to my brother for that the red knight s lion had maimed his own 
perceval was little glad of these tidings , for that he had sent him that had been slain on account of the horse 
sir , saith perceval , your brother had not deserved his death , methinketh , for it was not he that slew the knight 
no , sir , i know it all of a truth , but another , that slew the red knight of the deep forest perceval was silent thereupon 
he lay the night at the hostl and was harboured right well , and on the morrow departed when he had taken leave 
he wandered until he came to a hermitage there where he heard mass 
after the service , the hermit came unto him and said  sir , saith he , in this forestare knights all armed that are keeping watch for the knight that slew aristr and the red knight and his lion as well 
wherefore they meet no knight in this forestbut they are minded to slay him for the knight that slew these twain 
sir , saith perceval , god keep me from meeting such folk as would do me evil 
xiii 
with that he departed from the hermitage and took leave of the hermit , and rideth until that he is come into the forestand espieth the knight that sitteth on aristr s horse for that he hath slain the other knight 
a second knight was with him 
they abide when they see perceval 
by my head , saith one of them , this same shield bare he that slew aristr , as it was told us , and , like enough , it may be he 
they come toward him , full career 
perceval seeth them coming , and forgetteth not his spurs , but rather cometh againstthem the speediesthe may 
the two knights smote him upon the shield and brake their spears 
perceval overtaketh him that sitteth on aristr s horse and thrustth an ell s length of his spear through his body and so overthroweth him dead 
xiv 
after that , he cometh to the other knight , that fain would have fled , and smiteth off the shoulder close to his side , and he fell dead by the side of the other 
he taketh both twain of their destiers , and knotteth the reins together and drveth them before him as far as the house of the hermit , that had issued forth of his hermitage 
he delivered unto him the horse of aristr and the other of the knight that he had sent thither 
sir , saith perceval , well i know that and you shall see any knight that hath need of it and shall ask you , you will lend him one of these horses , for great courtesy is it to aid a worshipful man when one seeth him in misfortune 
sir , saith the hermit , but now since , were here three knights 
soon as they knew that the two were dead whose horses you had delivered unto me , they departed , fleeing the speediestthey might 
i praised them much of their going , and told them they did well not to die on such occasion , for that the souls of knights that die under arms are nigher to hell than to paradise 
xv 
perceval , that never was without sore toil and travail so long as he lived , departed from the hermitage and went with great diligence right through the midstof the forest and met a knight that came a great gallop over againsthim 
he knew perceval by the shield that he bare 
sir , saith he , i come from the caste of the black hermit , there where you will find the damsel of the car as soon as you arrive , wherefore she sendeth you word by me that you speed your way and go to her to ask for the chessboard that was taken away from before messire gawain , or otherwise never again will you enter into the caste you have won 
sir , saith he , hast , moreover , on account of a thing mostpitiful that i heard in this forest  i heard how a knight was leading a damsel againsther will , beating her with a great scourge 
i passed by the launde on the one side and he on the other , so that i espied him through the underwood that was between us 
it seemed me that the damsel was bemoaning her for the son of the widow lady that had given her back her caste , and the knight said that for love of him he would put her into the servent s pit 
an old knight and a priestwent after the knight to pray him have mercy on the damsel , but so cruel is he , that so far from doing so , he rather waxed sore wroth for that they prayed it of him , and made cheer and semblant as though he would have slain them 
the knight departed from perceval and taketh leave and perceval goeth along the way that the knight had come , thinking that he would go after the damsel for he supposeth certainly that it is she to whom he gave back her caste , and would fain know what knight it is that entreateth her in such fashion 
he hath ridden until he is come into the deepestof the forestand the thickest he bideth awhile and listneth and heareth the voice of the damsel , that was in a great valley where the serpent s pit was , wherein the knight was minded to set her 
she cried right loud for mercy , and wept , and the knight gave her great stokes of the scourge to make her be stll 
perceval had no will to tarry longer , but rather cometh thither as fastas he may 
xvi 
soon as the damsel seeth perceval , she knoweth him again 
she claspeth her two hands together and saith , ha , sir , for god s sake have mercy 
already have you given me back the caste whereof this knight would reave me 
the horse whereon perceval sat , the knight knew him 
sir , saith he , this horse was the horse of messire the red knight of the deep forest  now at lastknow i that it was you that slew him 
it may well be , saith perceval , and if that i slew him , good right had i to do so , for he had cut off the head of a son of mine uncle , the which head this damsel carried of a long time 
by my head , saith the knight , sith that you slew him , you are my mortal enemy 
he drweth off in the midstof the launde and perceval likewise , and then they come together as fastas their horses may carry them , and either giveth other great buffets in the midstof their breastwith their spears the mostthey may 
perceval smiteth the knight so passing hard that he overthroweth him to the ground right over the croup of his horse , and in the fall that he made , he tobrake him the mastrbone of his leg so that he might not move 
perceval alighteth to the ground and cometh where the knight lay 
he crieth him mercy that he slay him not 
perceval telleth him he need not fear death , nor that he is minded to slay him in such plight as he is , but that like as he was fain to make the damsel do he will make him do 
he maketh alight the other old knight and the priest then maketh the knight be carried to the pit of the serpent and the worms , whereof was great stre 
the pit was dark and deep 
when that the knight was therein he might not live long for the worms that were there 
the damsel thanked perceval much of this goodness and of the other that he had done her 
she departeth and returneth again to her caste , and was assured therein on all sides , nor never thereafter had she drad of no knight , for the cruel justce that perceval had done on this one 
xvii 
the son of the widow lady of his good knighthood knoweth not how to live without travail 
he well knoweth that when he hath been at the black hermit s caste , he will in some measure have achieved his task 
many another thing behoveth him to do tofore , and little toil he thinketh it , whereof shall god be well pleased 
he hath ridden so far one day and another , that he came into a land where he met knights stut and stong there where god was neither believed in nor loved , but where rather they adored false images and false lordgods and devils that made themselves manifest  he met a knight at the entrance of a forest ha , sir 
saith he to perceval , return you back 
no need is there for you to go further , for the folk of this island are not wellbelievers in god 
i may not pass through the land but by truce only 
the queen of this land was sistr of the king of oriande , that lancelot killed in the battle and all his folk , and seized his land , wherein all the folk were misbelievers 
now throughout all the land they believe in the saviour of the world 
thereof is she passing sorrowful , and hateth all them that believe in the new law , insomuch as that she would not look upon any that believed , and prayed to her gods that never might she see none until such time as the new law should be overthrown 
god , that hath power to do this , blinded her forthwith 
now she supposeth that the false gods wherein she believeth have done this , and saith that when the new law shall fall , she will have her sight again by the renewal of these gods , and by their virtue , nor , until this hour , hath she no desire to see 
i tell you this , saith the knight , because i would not that you should go thither as yet , for that i misdoubt of your being troubled thereby 
sir , gramercy , saith perceval , but no knighthood is there so fair as that which is undertaken to set forward the law of god , and for him ought one to make better endeavour than for all other 
in like manner as he put his body in pain and travail for us , so ought each to put his own for him 
he departeth from the knight , and was right joyous of this that he heard him say that lancelot had won a kingdom wherein he had done away the false law 
and he knew the tidings that the king had put him in prison , he would not have been glad at all , for lancelot was of his lineage and was therefore good knight , and for this he loved him right well 
xviii 
perceval rideth until nightfall , and findeth a great caste fortified with a great drwbridge , and there were tall ancient towers within 
he espied at the door a squire that had the weight of a chain on his neck , and at the other end the chain was fixed to a great bulk of iron 
the chain was as long as the length of the bridge 
cometh he over againstperceval when he seeth him coming 
sir , saith he , meseemeth you believe in god 
fair friend , so do i , the besti may 
sir , for god s sake , enter not this caste 
wherefore , fair friend 
saith perceval 
sir , saith he , i will tell you 
i am christan , even as are you , and i am thrall within there and guard this gate , as you see 
it is the mostcruel caste that i know , and it is called the raving caste 
there be three knights within there , full young and comely , but so soon as they see a knight of the new law , forthwith are they out of their senses , and all raving mad , so that nought may endure between them 
moreover , there is within one of the fairestdamsels that saw i ever 
she guardeth the knights so soon as they begin to rave , and so much they drad her that they durstnot disobey her commandment in aught that she willeth , for many folk would they evilly entreat were it not for her 
for that i am their thrall they put up with me , and i have no fear of them , but many is the christan knight that hath come in hither that never hath issued hence 
fair sweet friend , saith perceval , i will enter in thither and i may , for i should not know this day how to go elsewhither , and true it is that greater power hath god than the devil 
he entereth into the caste and alighteth in the midstof the courtyard 
xix 
the damsel was at the windows of the hall , that was of passing great beauty 
she cometh down as soon as she may , and seeth perceval come in and the cross on his shield , and knoweth well thereby that he is christan 
ha , sir , for god s sake , saith she , come not up above , for there be three of the comeliestknights that ever were seen that are playing at tables and at dice in a chamber , and they are brothersgerman 
they will all go out of their senses so soon as they shall see you 
damsel , saith perceval , please god , so shall they not , and such a miracle is good to see , for it is only right that all they who will not believe in god should be raving mad when they see the things that come of him 
perceval goeth up into the hall , all armed , for all that the damsel saith 
she followeth him as fastas she may 
the three knights espied perceval all armed and the cross on his shield , and forthwith leapt up and were beside themselves 
they rolled their eyes and tore themselves and roared like devils 
there were axes and swords in the hall that they go to lay hold on , and they are fain to leap upon perceval , but no power have they to do so , for such was the will of god 
when they saw that they might not come anigh him , they ran either on other and so slew themselves between them , nor would they stnt their fighting together for the damsel 
perceval beheld the miracle of these folks that were thus killed , and the damsel that made right great dole thereof 
ha , damsel , saith he , weep not , but repent you of this false belief , for they that are unwilling to believe in god shall die like mad folks and devils 
perceval made the squires that were there within bear the bodies out of the hall , and made them be castinto a running water , and staightway slew all the other , for that they were not minded to believe 
the caste was all emptied of the misbelieving folk save only the damsel and those that waited upon her , and the christan thrall that guarded the gate 
perceval set him forth of the chain , then led him up into the hall and made him disarm him 
he found sundr right rich robes 
the damsel , that was of right great beauty , looked at him and saw that he was a full comely knight , and well pleased she was with him 
she honoured him in right great sort , but she might not forget the three knights that were her brothers , and made sore dole for them 
damsel , saith perceval , nought availeth it to make this dole , but take comfort on some other manner 
perceval looked at the hall from one end to the other and saw that it was right rich , and the damsel , in whom was full great beauty , stnted of making dole to look at perceval 
she seeth that he is comely knight and gentle and tall and well furnished of good conditions , wherefore he pleaseth her much , and forthwith beginneth she to love him , and saith to herself that , so he would leave his god for the god in whom she believed , right glad would she be thereof , and would make him lord of her caste , for it seemed her that better might she not bestw it , and sith that her brothers are dead , there may be no bringing of them back , and therefore better would it be to forget her dole 
little knew she perceval s thought , for had she known that which he thinketh , she would have imagined not this 
for , and had she been christan he might not have been drwn to love her in such sort as she thinketh , sith that josephus telleth us that never did he lose his virginity for woman , but rather died virgin and chast and clean of his body 
in this mind was she stll , nor never might she refrain her heart from him 
thinketh she rather that , and he knew she was minded to love him , right joyous would he be thereof , for that she is of so passing beauty 
perceval asketh the damsel what she hath in her thought 
sir , saith she , nought think i but only good and you will 
damsel , saith perceval , never , please god , shall there be hindrnce of me but that you renounce this evil law and believe in the good 
sir , saith she , do you renounce yours for love of me , and i will do your commandment and your will 
damsel , saith perceval , nought availeth to tell me this 
were you man like as you are woman , your end would have come with the others 
please god , your tribulation shall tend itself to good 
sir , saith she , so you are willing to promise me that you will love me like as knight ought to love damsel , i am well inclined to believe in your god 
damsel , i promise you as i am a christan that so you are willing to receive baptism , i will love you as he that firmly believeth in god ought to love damsel 
sir , saith she , i ask no more of you 
she biddeth send for a holy man , a hermit that was in the forestappurtenant , and right gladly came he when he heard the tidings 
they held her up and baptized her , both her and her damsels with her 
perceval held her at the font 
josephus witnesseth us in this histry that she had for name celeste 
great joy made she of her baptism , and her affections turned she unto good 
the hermit remained there with her , and taught her to understnd the firm believe , and did the service of our lord 
the damsel was of right good life and right holy , and ended thereafter in many good works 
perceval departed from the caste , and gave thanks to our lord and praise , that he hath allowed him to conquer a caste so cruel and to attorn it to the law 
he went his way a great pace , all armed , until he came into a country wherein was great grief being made , and the more part said that he was come that should destoy their law , for that already had he won their stongestcaste 
he is come towards an ancient caste that was at the head of a forest  he looketh and seeth at the entrance of the gateway a full great throng of folk 
he seeth a squire come forth thence , and asketh him unto whom belongeth the caste 
sir , saith he , it is queen jandre s , that hath made her be brought before her gate with the folk you see yonder , for she hath heard tell how the knights of the raving caste are dead , and another knight that hath conquered the caste hath made the damsel be baptized , wherefore much she marvelleth how this may be 
she is in much drad of losing her land , for her brother madeglant of oriande is dead , so that she may no longer look to none for succour , and she hath been told how the knight that conquered the raving caste is the bestknight of the world , and that none may endure againsthim 
for this doubtance and fear of him she is minded to go to one of her own castes that is somewhat stonger 
perceval departeth from the squire and rideth until they that were at the entrance of the gateway espied him 
they saw the red cross that he bare on his shield , and said to the queen , lady , a christan knight is coming into this caste 
take heed , saith she , that it be not he that is about to overthrow our law 
perceval cometh thither and alighteth , and cometh before the queen all armed 
the queen asketh what he seeketh 
lady , saith he , nought seek i save good only to yourself so you hinder it not 
you come , saith she , from the raving caste , there where three brothers are slain , whereof is great loss 
lady , saith he , at that caste was i , and now fain would i that your own were at the will of jesus christ in like manner as is that 
by my head , saith she , and your lord hath so great power as is said , so will it be 
lady , his virtue and his puissance are far greater than they say 
that would i fain know , saith she , presently , and i am fain to pray you that you depart not from me until that it hath been proven 
perceval granteth it gladly 
she returned into her caste and perceval with her 
when he was alighted he went up into the hall 
they that were within marvelled them much that she should thus give consent , for never , sithence that she had been blind , might she allow no knight of the new law to be so nigh her , and made slay all them that came into her power , nor might she never see clear so long as she had one of them before her 
now is her disposition altered in such sort as that she would fain she might see clear him that hath come in , for she hath been told that he is the comeliestknight of the world and well seemeth to be as good as they witness of him 
perceval remained there gladly for that he saw the lady s cruelty was somewhat slackened , and it seemed him that it would be great joy and she were willing to turn to god , and they that are within there , for well he knoweth that so she should hold to the new law , all they of the land would be of the same mind 
when perceval had lain the night at the caste , the lady on the morrow sent for all the more powerful of her land , and came forth of her chamber into the hall where perceval was , seeing as clear as ever she had seen aforetime 
lords , saith she , hearken ye all , for now will i tell you the truth like as it hath befallen me 
i was lying in my bed lastnight , and well know ye that i saw not a whit , and made my orisons to our gods that they would restre me my sight 
it seemed me they made answer that they had no power so to do , but that i should make be slain the knight that was arrived here , and that and i did not , sore wroth would they be with me 
when i had heard their voices say that nought might they avail me as for that i had prayed of them , i remembered me of the lord in whom they that hold the new law believe 
i prayed him right sweetly that , and so it were that he had such virtue and such puissance as many said , he would make me see clear , so as that i might believe in him 
at that hour i fell on sleep , and meseemed that i saw one of the fairestladies in the world , and she was delivered of a child therewithin , and he had about him a great brightness of light like it were the sun shone at right noonday 
when the child was born , so passing fair was he and so passing gentle and of so sweet semblant that the looks of him pleased me well 
meseemed that at his deliverance there was a company of folk the fairestthat were seen ever , and they were like as it had been birds and made full great joy 
methought that an ancient man that was with her , told me that my lady had lostno whit of her maidenhood for the child 
well pleased was i the while this thing lastd me 
it seemed me that i saw it like as i do you 
thereafter , methought i saw a man bound to a stke , in whom was great sweetness and humility , and an evil folk beat him with scourges and rods right cruelly , so that the blood ran down thereof 
they would have no mercy on him 
of this might i not hold myself but that i wept for pity of him 
therewithal i awoke and marvelled much whence it should come and what it might be 
in anyway it pleased me much that i had seen it 
it seemed me after this , that i saw the same man that had been bound to the stke set upon a cross , and nailed thereon right grievously and smitten in the side with a spear , whereof had i such great pity that needs musti weep of the sore pain that i saw him suffer 
i saw the lady at the feet of the cross , and knew her again that i had seen delivered of the child , but none might set in writing the great dole that she made 
on the other side of the cross was a man that seemed not joyful , but he recomforted the lady the fairesthe might 
another folk were there that collected his blood in a mostholy vessel that one of them held for it 
afterward , methought i saw him taken down of hanging on the cross , and set in a sepulchre of stne 
thereof had i great pity for , so long as meseemed i saw him thus never might i withhold me from weeping 
so soon as the pity came into my heart , and the tears into my eyes , i had my sight even as you see 
in such a lord as this ought one to believe , for he suffered death when he might lightly have avoided it had he so willed , but he did it to save his people 
in this lord i will that ye all believe , and so renounce our false gods , for they be devils and therefore may not aid us nor avail us 
he that will not believe , him will i make be slain or die a shameful death 
the lady made her be held up and baptized , and all them that would not do the same she made be destoyed and banished 
this histry telleth us that her name was salubre 
she was good lady and well believed in god , and so holy life led she thereafter that in a hermitage she died 
perceval departed from the caste right joyous in his heart of the lady and her people that believed in the new law 
title i 
afterward , this title telleth us that meliot of logres was departed from caste perilous sound and whole , by virtue of the sword that lancelot had brought him , and of the cloth that he took in the chapel perilous 
sore sorrowful was he of the tidings he had heard that messire gawain was in prison and he knew not where , but he had been borne on hand that two knights that were kinsmen of them of the raving caste that had slain one another , had shut him in prison on account of perceval that had won the caste 
now , saith meliot of logres , never shall he have ease again until he knoweth where messire gawain is 
he rideth amidsta forest and prayeth god grant him betimes to hear witting of messire gawain 
the forestwas stange and gloomy 
he rode until nightfall but might not find neither hold nor hermitage 
he looketh right amidstthe forestbefore him and seeth a damsel sitting that bemoaneth herself full sore 
the moon was dark and the place right foul of seeming and the forestgloomy of shadow 
ha , damsel , and what do you here at this hour 
sir , saith she , i may not amend it , the more is my sorrow 
for the place is more perilous than you think 
look , saith she , up above , and you will see the occasion wherefore i am here 
meliot looketh and seeth two knights all armed hanging up above the damsel s head 
thereof much marvelleth he 
ha , damsel , saith he , who slew these knights so foully 
sir , saith she , the knight of the galley that singeth in the sea 
wherefore hath he hanged them in such wise 
for this , saith she , that they believed in god and his sweet mother 
so behoveth me to watch them here for forty days , that none take them down of hanging , for and they were taken hence he would lose his caste , he saith , and would cut off my head 
by my head , saith meliot , such watch is foul shame to damsel , and no longer shall you remain here 
ha , sir , saith the damsel , then shall i be a dead woman , for he is of so great cruelty that none scarce might protect me againsthim 
ii 
damsel , saith meliot , foul shame would it be and i left here these knights in such wise for the reproach of other knights 
meliot made them graves with his sword , and so buried them the besthe might 
sir , saith the damsel , and you take not thought to protect me , the knight will slay me 
tomorrow , when he findeth not the knights , he will search all the forestto look for me 
meliot and the damsel together go their way through the forestuntil they come to a chapel where was wont to be a hermit that the knight of the galley had destoyed 
he helpeth down the damsel of his horse , and afterward they entered into the chapel , where was a great brightness of light , and a damsel was there that kept watch over a dead knight 
meliot marvelleth him much 
damsel , said meliot , when was this knight killed 
sir , yestrday the knight of the galley slew him on the sea shore , wherefore behoveth me thus keep watch , and in the morning will he come hither or ever he go to the caste where messire gawain hath tomorrow to fight with a lion , all unarmed , and my lady , that is mistess both of me and of this damsel you have brought hither , will likewise be brought tomorrow to the place where the lion is to slay messire gawain , and she in like sort will be afterward delivered to the lion and she renounce not the new law wherein the knight that came from raving caste , whereof she is lady , hath made her believe 
we ourselves shall be in like manner devoured along with her 
this damsel would stll have taken respite of my death and she had stll kept guard over the knights that were so foully hanged above her 
natheless , sith that you have taken them down from where they were hanging , you have done a right good deed , whatsoever betide , for the lord of the red tower will give his caste to the knight for this 
meliot is right joyous of the tidings that he hath heard of messire gawain that he is stll on live , for well knoweth he , sith that the knight of the galley will come by the chapel there , that he will come thither or ever messire gawain doth battle with the lion 
sir , saith the damsel of the chapel , for god s sake , take this damsel to a place of safety , for the knight will be so wood mad of wrath and despite so soon as he cometh hither , that he will be fain to smite off her head forthwith , and of yourself also have i great fear 
iii 
damsel , saith meliot , the knight is but a man like as am i 
yea , sir , but stonger is he and more cruel than seem you to be 
meliot was in the chapel the night until the morrow , and heard the knight coming like a tempest and he brought with him the lady of the caste and reviled her from time to time , and meliot seeth him come , and a dwarf that followeth after him a great pace 
he crieth out to him  sir , behold there the disloyal knight through whom you have lostyour caste 
now hast 
avenge yourself of him 
after that will we go to the death of messire gawain 
meliot , so soon as he espieth him , mounteth and maketh his arms ready 
is it you , saith the knight of the galley , that hath trespassed on my demesne and taken down my knights 
by my head , yours were they not 
rather were they the knights of god , and foul outrage have you done herein when you slew them so shamefully 
he goeth toward the knight without more words , and smiteth him so passing stong amidstthe breastthat he pierceth the habergeon and thrustth all the iron of his spear into his body and afterward drweth it back to him with a great wrench 
the knight smiteth him so hard on his shield that he maketh an ell s length pass beyond , for right wroth was he that he was wounded 
the dwarf crieth to him , away , then 
the knight endureth againstyou that have slain so many of them 
the knight of the galley waxeth wood wrath 
he taketh his career , and cometh as fastas his horse may carry him , and smiteth meliot so stongly that he breaketh his spear in such sort that he maketh both him and his horse stgger 
meliot catcheth him better , for he thrustth the spear right through his body and hurleth againsthim at the bypassing with such stutness and force that he maketh him fall dead to the ground from his horse 
the dwarf thought to escape , but meliot smote off his head , whereof the damsels gave him great thanks , for many a mischief had he wrought them 
iv 
meliot buried the knight that he found in the chapel dead , then told the damsels that he might abide no longer , but would go succour messire gawain and he might 
the damsels were horsed to their will , for one had the horse of the knight that was slain and the other the horse of the dwarf 
the other damsel was come upon a mule , and they said that they would go back , for the country was made all safe by the death of the knight 
they thanked meliot much , for they say truly that he hath rescued them from death 
meliot departeth from the damsels and goeth right amidstthe forestas he that would mostfain hear tidings of messire gawain 
when he had ridden of a long space , he met a knight that was coming all armed at great pace 
sir knight , saith he to meliot , can you tell me tidings of the knight of the galley 
what have you to do therein 
saith meliot 
sir , the lord of the red tower hath made bring messire gawain into a launde of this forest and there , all unarmed , musthe do battle with a lion 
my lord is waiting for the knight of the galley , that is to bring two damsels thither that the lion will devour when he shall have slain messire gawain 
will the battle be presently 
saith meliot 
yea , sir , saith the knight , soon enough betimes , for messire gawain hath already been led thither and there bound to a stke until such time as the lion shall be come 
will he be unbound , but even then two knights all armed will keep watch on him 
tell me tidings of the knight of the galley , and you have seen him 
go forward , saith he , and you will hear tidings of him 
meliot departeth thereupon , a great gallop , and cometh nigh the launde whereunto messire gawain had been brought 
he espied the two knights that kept guard over him , and if that messire gawain were in fear , little marvel was it , for he thought that his end had come 
meliot espied him bound to an iron stple with cords about the body on all sides so that he might not move 
meliot hath great pity thereof in his heart , and saith to himself that he will die there sooner than messire gawain shall die 
he clappeth spurs to his horse when he cometh nigh the knights , and overtaketh one of them with such a rush that he thrustth his spear right through his body , and beareth him down dead 
the other was fain to go to the caste for succour when he saw his fellow dead 
meliot slew him forthwith 
he cometh to messire gawain , and so unbindeth him and cutteth the cords wherewith he is bound 
sir , saith he , i am meliot of logres , your knight 
v 
when messire gawain felt himself unbound , no need to ask whether he had joy thereof 
the tidings were come to the red court that queen jandre was christned and baptized , and that the knight was come that had such force and puissance in him that none might endure againsthim for the god in whom he believed , and they knew likewise that the knight of the galley was dead , and messire gawain unbound and the knights that guarded him slain 
they say that there may they not abide , so they depart from the caste and say that they will cross the sea to protect their bodies , for that there they may have no safety 
vi 
when meliot had delivered messire gawain he made him be armed with the arms , such as they were , of one of the knights he had slain 
messire gawain mounted on a horse such as pleased him , and right great joy had he at heart 
they marvel much how it is that they of the caste have not come after them , but they know not their thought nor how they are scared 
meliot , saith messire gawain , you have delivered me from death this time and one other , nor never had i acquaintance with any knight that hath done so much for me in so short a time as have you 
they departed the speediestthey might and rode nigh enow to the caste , but they heard none moving within nor any noise , nor saw they none issue forth , and much marvelled they that none should come after them 
they rode until they came to the head of the forestand caught sight of the sea that was nigh enough before them , and saw that there was a great clashing of arms at the brink of the sea 
a single knight was doing battle with all them that would fain have entered into a ship , and held stur so stffly againstthem that he toppled the more part into the sea 
they went thither as fastas they might , and when they drw nigh to the ship they knew that it was perceval by his arms and his shield 
or ever they reached it , the ship was put off into the midstof the sea , wherein he was launched of his own great hardiment , and they went on fighting againsthim within the ship 
meliot , saith messire gawain , see you , there is perceval the good knight , and now may we say of a truth that he is in sore peril of death 
for that ship , save god bethink him thereof , shall arrive in such manner and in such a place as that never more shall we have no witting of him , and , so he perish for ever , no knight on live may have power to set forward the law of our lord 
vii 
messire gawain seeth the ship going further away , and perceval that defendeth himself therein againstthem that set upon him 
right heavy is he that he came not sooner , or ever the ship had put off from the land 
he turneth back , he and meliot together , and right sorrowful was messire gawain of perceval , for they knew not in what land he might arrive , and , might he have followed , right gladly would he have gone after him to aid him 
they have ridden until they meet a knight 
messire gawain asketh him whence he cometh , and he saith from king arthur s court 
what tidings can you tell us thereof 
saith messire gawain 
sir , bad enough 
saith he 
king arthur hath neglected all his knights for briant of the isles , and hath put one of his bestknights in prison 
what is his name 
saith messire gawain 
sir , he is called lancelot of the lake 
he had reconquered all the islands that had been reft of king arthur , and slain king madeglant , and conquered the land of oriande that he turned to the belief of the saviour of the world , and , so soon as he had conquered his enemies , king arthur sent for him forthwith and staightway put him in his prison by the counsel of briant of the isles 
king arthur will have a surfeit of friends betimes 
for king claudas hath assembled his folk in great plenty to reconquer the kingdom of oriande and come back upon king arthur by the counsel of briant of the isles that betrayeth the king , for he hath made him his seneschal and commander of all his land 
sir knight , saith messire gawain , needs mustthe king miscarry that setteth aside the counsel of his good knights for the leasings of a traitor 
thereupon the knight departed from messire gawain 
right heavy is he of this that he hath said , that the king hath put lancelot in prison 
never tofore did he aught whereby he wrought so much to blame 
title i 
hereupon the stry is silent of messire gawain and meliot and speaketh of king claudas that hath assembled a great folk by the counsel of briant of the isles to come into the land of king arthur , for he knoweth that it is disgarnished of the good knights that wont there to be , and he knoweth all the secret plottings of the court and what power king arthur hath withal 
he drweth toward his land the nighesthe may , and hath won back the kingdom of oriande all at his will 
they of albanie stll hold againsthim and challenge the land the bestthey may 
tidings thereof come to the court of king arthur , and they of the country sent him word that so he send them not succour betimes they will yield up the land to king claudas , and oftentimes they long after lancelot , and say that so they had a defender like him , the islands would be all at peace 
the king sent briant of the isles thither many times , that ever incontinent returned thence discomfit , but never sent he thither him that should have power to protect the land againstking claudas 
king arthur was sore troubled , for no witting had he of messire gawain nor messire ywain nor of others whereby his court had use of right to be feared and draded and of high renown throughout all other kingdoms 
the king was one day in the hall at cardoil , right heavy 
he was at one of the windows , and remembered him of the queen and of his good knights that he wont to see oftener at court , whereof the more part were dead , and of the adventures that wont to befall therein whereof they saw none no longer 
lucan the butler seeth him right heavy and drweth nigh unto him quietly 
ii 
sir , saith he , meseemeth you are without joy 
lucan , said the king , joy hath been somewhat far from me sithence that the queen hath been dead , and gawain and the other knights have held aloof from my court so that they deign come hither no longer 
moreover , king claudas warreth upon me and conquereth my lands so that no power have i to rescue me for default of my knights 
sir , saith lucan , herein is there nought whereof you have right to accuse any save yourself alone 
for you have done evil unto him that hath served you , and good unto them that are traitors to you 
you have one of the bestknights in the world and the mostloyal in your prison , wherefore all the other hold them aloof from your court 
lancelot had served you well by his good will and by his good knighthood , nor never had he done you any disservice whereof you might in justce have done him such shame 
nor never will your enemies withhold them from you nor have drad of you save only through him and other your good knights 
know of a truth that lancelot and messire gawain are the bestof your court 
lucan , saith king arthur , so thought i ever again to have affiance in him , i would make him be set forth of my prison , for well i know that i have wrought discourteously toward him 
lancelot is of a great heart , wherefore would he not slacken of his despite for that which hath been done unto him until such time as he should be avenged thereof , for no king is there in the world , how puissant soever he be , againstwhom he durstnot well maintain his right 
iii 
sir , saith lucan , lancelot well knoweth that and you had taken no counsel but your own , he would not have been thus entreated , and i dare well say that never so long as he liveth will he misdo in aught towards you , for he hath in him much valour and loyalty , as many a time have you had good cause to know 
wherefore , and you would fain have aid and succour and hold your realm again , behoveth you set him forth of the prison , or otherwise never will you succeed herein , and , if you do not so , you will lose your land by treason 
the king held by the counsel of lucan the butler 
he made bring lancelot before him into the midstof the hall , that was somewhat made ean of his being in prison , but he bore him as he wont , nor might none look at him to whom he seemed not to be good knight 
lancelot , saith the king , how is it with you 
sir , saith he , it hath been ill with me long time , but , please god , it shall be better hereafter 
lancelot , saith the king , i repent me of this that i have done to you , and i have bethought me much of the good services i have found in you , wherefore i will do you amends thereof at your will , in such sort as that the love between us shall be whole as it was tofore 
iv 
sir , saith lancelot , your amends love i much , and your love more than of any other 
never , please god , will i misdo you for aught that you may have done to me , for it is well known that i have not been in prison for no treason i have done , nor for no folly , but only for that it was your will 
never will it be reproached me as of shame , and , sith that you have done me nought whereof i may have blame nor reproach , my devoir it is to withhold me from hating you 
for you are my lord , and if that you do me ill , without flattery of myself the ill you do me is your own 
please god , whatsoever you have done me , never shall my aid fail you , rather , everywhere will i set my body in adventure for your love , in like sort as i have done many a time 
v 
in the court of king arthur was right great joy of the mostpart when they heard that lancelot was set forth of prison , but not a whit rejoiced were briant and his folk 
the king commanded that lancelot should be well cared for and made whole again , and that all should be at his commandment 
the court was all overjoyed thereof , and they said  now at lastmight the king make war in good assurance 
lancelot was foremostin the king s court and more redoubted than was ever another of the knights 
briant of the isles came one day before the king 
sir , saith he , behold , here is lancelot that wounded me in your service , wherefore i will that he know i am his enemy 
briant , saith lancelot , and if that you deserved it tofore , well may you be sorry thereof , and sith that you wish to be mine enemy , your friend will i not be 
for well may i deem of your love according as i have found it in you 
sir , saith briant to the king , you are my lord , and i am one you are bound to protect 
you know well that so rich am i in lands and so puissant in friends that i may well despise mine enemy , nor will i not remain at your court so long as lancelot is therein 
say not that i depart thence with any shame as toward myself 
rather thus go i hence as one that will gladly avenge me , so i have place and freedom , and i see plainly and know that you and your court love him far better than you love me , wherefore behoveth me take thought thereof 
briant , saith the king , remain as yet , and i will make amends for you to lancelot , and i myself will make amends for him to you 
vi 
sir , saith briant , by the faith that i owe to you , none amends will i have of him nor other until such time as i have drwn as much blood of his body as did he of mine , and i will well that he know it 
with that briant departeth from the court all wrathful , but if that lancelot had not feared to anger the king , briant would not have ridden a league english or ever he had followed and forced him to fight 
briant goeth toward the caste of the hard rock , and saith that better would it have been for the king that lancelot were stll in prison , for that such a plea will he move againsthim and he may bring it to bear , as that he shall lose thereof the bestparcel of his land 
he is gone into the land of king claudas , and saith that now at lasthath he need of his aid , for lancelot is issued forth of the king s prison and is better loved at court than all other , so that the king believeth in no counsel save his only 
king claudas sweareth unto him and maketh pledge that never will he fail him , and briant to him again 
title i 
herewithal is the stry silent of briant and talketh of perceval , that the ship beareth away right swiftly 
so long hath he held battle therein that every one hath he slain of them that were in the ship save only the pilot that stereth her , for him hath he in covenant that he will believe in god and renounce his evil law 
perceval is far from land so that he seeth nought but sea only , and the ship speedeth onward , and god guideth him , as one that believeth in him and loveth him and serveth him of a good heart 
the ship ran on by night and by day as it pleased god , until that they saw a caste and an island of the sea 
he asked his pilot if he knew what caste it was 
certes , saith he , not i , for so far have we run that i know not neither the sea nor the strs 
they come nigh the caste , and saw four that sounded bells at the four corners of the town , right sweetly , and they that sounded them were clad in white garments 
they are come thither 
ii 
soon as the ship had taken haven under the caste , the sea withdrweth itself back , so that the ship is left on dr land 
none were therein save perceval , his horse , and the pilot 
they issued forth of the ship and went by the side of the sea toward the caste , and therein were the fairesthalls and the fairestmansions that any might see ever 
he looketh underneath a tree that was tall and broad and seeth the fairestfountain and the clearestthat any may devise , and it was all surrounded of rich pillars , and the gravel thereof seemed to be gold and precious stnes 
above this fountain were two men sitting , their beards and hair whiter than drven snow , albeit they seemed young of visage 
soon as they saw perceval they drssed them to meet him , and bowed down and worshipped the shield that he bare at his neck , and kissed the cross and then the boss wherein were the hallows 
sir , say they , marvel not of this that we do , for well knew we the knight that bare this shield tofore you 
many a time we saw him or ever god were crucified 
perceval marvelleth much of this that they say , for they talk of a time that is long agone 
iii 
lords , know ye then how he was named 
say they , joseph of abarimacie , but no cross was there on the shield before the death of jesus christ  but he had it set thereon after the crucifixion of jesus christfor the sake of the saviour that he loved so well 
perceval took off the shield from his neck , and one of the worshipful men setteth upon it as it were a posy of herbs that was blooming with the fairestflowers in the world 
perceval looketh beyond the fountain and seeth in a right fair place a round vessel like as it were ivory , and it was so large that there was a knight within , all armed 
he looketh thereinto and seeth the knight , and speaketh unto him many times , but never the more willeth the knight to answer him 
perceval looketh at him in wonderment , and cometh back to the good men and asketh them who is this knight , and they tell him that he may know not as yet 
they lead him to a great hall and bear his shield before him , whereof they make right great joy , and show thereunto great worship 
he seeth the hall right rich , for hall so rich and so fair had he seen never 
it was hung about with right rich cloths of silk , and in the midstof the hall was imaged the saviour of the world so as he is in his majest , with the apostes about him , and within were great galleries that were full of folk and seemed to be of great holiness , and so were they , for had they not been good men they might not there have remained 
iv 
sir , say the two mastrs to perceval , this house that you see here so rich , is the hall royal 
by my faith , saith perceval , so ought it well to be , for never saw i none so much of worth 
he looketh all around , and seeth the richesttables of gold and ivory that he saw ever 
one of the mastrs clappeth his hands thrice , and three and thirty men come into the hall all in a company 
they were clad in white garments , and not one of them but had a red cross in the midstof his breast and they seemed to be all of an age 
as soon as they enter into the hall they do worship to god our lord and set out their cups 
went they to wash at a great laver of gold , and then went to sit at the tables 
the mastrs made perceval sit at the mostmastrtable with themselves 
they were served thereat right gloriously , and perceval looked about him more gladlier than he ate 
v 
while he was thus looking , he seeth a chain of gold come down above him loaded with precious stnes , and in the midstthereof was a crown of gold 
the chain descended a great length and held on to nought save to the will of our lord only 
as soon as the mastrs saw it descending they opened a great wide pit that was in the midstof the hall , so that one could see the hole all openly 
as soon as the entrance of this pit was discovered , there issued thence the greatestcry and mostdolorous that any heard ever , and when the worshipful men hear it , they stetched out their hands towards our lord and all began to weep 
perceval heareth this dolour , and marvelleth much what it may be 
he seeth that the chain of gold descendeth thither and is there styed until they have wellnigh eaten , and then drweth itself again into the air and so goeth again aloft 
perceval knoweth not what became thereof , and the mastr covereth the pit again , that was right grisly to see , and pitiful to hear were the voices that issued therefrom 
vi 
the good men rose from the tables when they had eaten , and gave thanks right sweetly to our lord 
then returned thither whence they had come 
sir , saith the mastr to perceval , the chain of gold that you have seen is right precious and the crown of gold likewise 
never may you issue forth from hence save you promise to return so soon as you shall see the ship and the sail crossed of a red cross 
otherwise may you not depart hence 
tell me , saith he , of the chain of gold and the crown , what it may be 
we will tell you not , saith one of the mastrs , save you promise that which i tell you 
certes , sir , saith perceval , i promise you faithfully , that so soon as i shall have done that i have to do for my lady my mother and one other , that i will return hither , so i be on live and i see your ship so marked as you say 
yea , be you faithful to the end herein , and you shall have the crown of gold upon your head so soon as you return , and so shall you be seated in the throne , and shall be king of an island that is near to this , right plenteous of all things good , for nought is there in the world that is there lacking that is needful for man s body 
king hermit was the king thereof that thus hath garnished it , and for that he approved himself so well in this kingdom , and that they who are in the island consented thereto , is he chosen to be king of a greater realm 
now they desire that another worshipful man be sent them for king , that shall do for them as much good as did he , but take you good heed , sith that you will be king therein , that the island be well garnished 
for , and you garnish it not well , you will be put into the poverty sticken island , the crying whereof you have but now since heard , and the crown thereof will again be reft from you 
for they that have been kings of the plenteous island and have not well approved them , are among the folk that you saw in the poverty sticken island , lacking in all things good 
so i tell you that king hermit , whom you will succeed , hath sent thither a great part of his folk 
there are the heads sealed in silver , and the heads sealed in lead , and the bodies whereunto these heads belonged 
i tell you that you mustmake come thither the head both of the king and of the queen 
of the other i tell you that they are in the povertysticken island 
we know not whether they shall ever issue forth thence 
vii 
sir , saith perceval , tell me of the knight that is all armed in the ivory vessel , who he is , and what is the name of this caste 
you may not know , saith the mastr , until your return 
tell me tidings of the mostholy graal , that you reconquered , is it stll in the holy chapel that was king fisherman s 
yea , sir , saith perceval , and the sword wherewith s 
john was beheaded , and other hallows in great plenty 
i saw the graal , saith the mastr , or ever joseph , that was uncle to king fisherman , collected therein the blood or jesus christ  know that well am i acquainted with all your lineage , and of what folk you were born 
for your good knighthood and for your good cleanness and for your good valour came you in hither , for such was our lord s will , and take heed that you be ready when place shall be , and time shall come , and you shall see the ship apparelled 
sir , saith perceval , mostwillingly shall i return , nor never would i have sought to depart but for my lady my mother , and for my sistr , for never have i seen no place that so much hath pleased me 
he was right well harboured the night within , and in the morning , or ever he departed , heard a holy mass in a holy chapel the fairestthat he had seen ever 
the mastr cometh to him after the mass and bringeth him a shield as white as snow 
afterwards , he saith , you will leave me your shield within for token of your coming and will bear this 
sir , saith perceval , i will do your pleasure 
he hath taken leave , and so departeth from the rich mansion , and findeth the ship all apparelled , and heareth sound the bells at his forthgoing the same as at his coming 
he entereth into the ship and the sail is set 
he leaveth the land far behind , and the pilot stereth the ship and our lord god guideth and leadeth him 
the ship runneth a great speed , for far enough had she to run , but god made her speed as he would , for he knew the passing great goodness and worth of the knight that was within 
viii 
god hath guided and led the ship by day and by night until that she arrived at an island where was a caste right ancient , but it seemed not to be overrich , rather it showed as had it been of great lordship in days of yore 
they castanchor , and perceval is come toward the caste and entereth in all armed 
he seeth the caste large , and the dwelling chambers fallen down and the houseplace roofless , and he seeth a lady sitting before the stps of an old hall 
she rose up as soon as she saw him , but she was right poorly clad 
it seemed well by her body and her cheer and her bearing that she was a gentlewoman , and he seeth that two damsels come with her that are young of age and are as poorly clad as is the lady 
sir , saith she to perceval , welcome may you be 
no knight have i seen enter this caste of a long time 
lady , saith perceval , god grant you joy and honour 
sir , saith she , need have we thereof , for none scarce have i had this long while past she leadeth him into a great ancient hall that was right poorly garnished 
sir , saith she , here will you harbour you the night , and you would take in good part that we may do and you knew the plight of this caste 
she maketh him be unarmed of a servant that was there within , and the damsels come before him and serve him right sweetly 
the lady bringeth him a mantle to do on 
sir , saith she , within are no better garments wherewith to show you honour than this 
perceval looketh on the damsels and hath great pity of them , for so well shapen were they of limb and body as that nature might not have better fashioned them , and all the beauty that may be in woman s body was in them , and all the sweetness and simpleness 
ix 
lady , saith perceval , is this caste , then , not yours 
sir , saith she , so much is all that remaineth unto me of all my land , and you see there my daughters of whom is it right sore pity , for nought have they but what you see , albeit gentlewomen are they and of high lineage , but their kinsfolk are too far away , and a knight that is right cruel hath reft us of our land sithence that my lord was dead , and holdeth a son of mine in his prison , whereof i am right sorrowful , for he is one of the comeliestknights in the world 
he had not been knight more than four years when he took him , and now may i aid neither myself nor other , but i have heard tell that there is a knight in the land of wales that was the son of alain li gros of the valleys of camelot , and he is the bestknight in the world , and this alain was brother of calobrutus , whose wife was i , and of whom i had my son and these two daughters 
this know i well , that and the good knight that is so near akin to them were by any adventure to come into this island , i should have my son again , and my daughters that are disherited would have their lands again freely , and so should i be brought out of sore pain and poverty 
i am of another lineage that is full far away , for king ban of benoic that is dead was mine uncle , but he hath a son that is a right good knight as i have been told , so that and one of these two should come nigh me in any of these islands right joyous should i be thereof 
x 
perceval heareth that the two damsels are his uncle s daughters , and hath great pity thereof 
lady , saith he , how is he named that is in prison 
sir , saith she , galobruns , and he that holdeth him in prison is named gohaz of the caste of the whale 
is his caste near this , lady 
saith he 
sir , there is but an arm of the sea to cross , and in all these islands of the sea is there none that hath any puissance but he only , and so assured is he that no drad hath he of any 
for none that is in this land durstoffend againsthim 
sir , one thing hath he bid me do , whereof i am sore grieved , that and i send him not one of my daughters , he hath sworn his oath that he will reave me of my caste 
lady , saith perceval , an oath is not always kept 
to the two damsels , please god , shall he do no shame , and right heavy am i of that he hath done already , for they were daughters of mine uncle 
alain li gros was my father and galobrutus my uncle , and many another good man that now is dead 
xi 
when the damsels heard this , they kneeled down before him , and began to weep for joy and kiss his hands , and pray him for god s sake have mercy on them and on their brother 
he saith that he will not depart from their land until he hath done all he may 
he remaineth the night in the caste and his mariner likewise 
the lady made great joy of perceval , and did him all the honour she might 
when the morrow came they showed him the land of the king that had reft them of their land , but the lady could not tell him where her son was in prison 
he departeth and cometh back to his ship when he hath taken leave of the lady and the damsels , and right glad was he to know that the damsels were so nigh to him of kin 
he prayeth god grant him that he may be able to give them back their land and bring them out of the poverty wherein they are 
he roweth until that he is come under a rock , wherein was a cave at top round and narrow and secure like as it were a little house 
perceval looketh on that side , and seeth a man sitting within 
he maketh the ship drw nigh the rock , then looketh and seeth the cutting of a way that went upwards through the rock 
he is come forth of the ship and goeth up the little path until he cometh into the little house 
he findeth within one of the comeliestknights in the world 
he had a ring at his feet and a collar on his neck with a chain whereof the other end was fixed by a stple into a great ledge of the rock 
he rose up over againstperceval as soon as he saw him 
sir knight , saith perceval , you are well made fast sir , that irketh me , saith the knight , better should i like myself elsewhere than here 
you would be right , saith perceval , for you are in right evil plight in the midstof this sea 
have you aught within to eat or to drnk 
sir , saith he , the daughter of the sick knight that dwelleth in the island hard by , sendeth me every day in a boat as much meat as i may eat , for she hath great pity of me 
the king that hath imprisoned me here hath reft her castes like as he hath those of my lady my mother 
may none remove you hence 
sir , in no wise , save he that set me here , for he keepeth with him the key of the lock , and he told me when he departed hence that never more should i issue forth 
by my head , saith perceval , but you shall 
you were the son of galobrutus , you were the son of mine uncle , saith perceval , and i of yours , so that it would be a reproach to me for evermore and i left you in this prison 
xii 
when galobruns heareth that he is his uncle s son , great joy hath he thereof 
he would have fallen at his feet , but perceval would not , and said to him , now be well assured , for i will seek your deliverance 
he cometh down from the rock , and so entereth the ship and roweth of a long space 
he looketh before him and seeth a right rich island and a right plenteous , and on the other side he seeth in a little islet a knight that is mounted up in a tall tree that was right broad with many boughs 
there was a damsel with him , that had climbed up also for drad of a serpent , great and evil favoured that had issued from a hole in a mountain 
the damsel seeth perceval s ship coming , and crieth out to him 
ha , sir , saith she , come to help this king that is up above , and me that am a damsel 
whereof are you afeard , damsel 
saith perceval 
of a great serpent , sir , saith she , that hath made us climb up , whereof ought i not to be sorry , for this king hath carried me off from my father s house , and would have done me shame of my body and this serpent had not run upon him 
what is the king s name , damsel 
saith perceval 
sir , he is called gohaz of the caste of the whale 
this great land is his own that is so plenteous , and other lands enow that he hath reft of my father and of other 
the king had great shame of this that the damsel told him , and made answer never a word 
perceval understndeth that it was he that held his cousin in prison , and is issued from the ship forthwith , sword drwn 
the serpent seeth him , and cometh toward him , jaws yawning , and castth forth fire and flame in great plenty 
perceval thrustth his sword right through the gullet 
now may you come down , saith he to the king 
sir , saith he , the key of a chain wherewith a certain knight is bound hath fallen , and the serpent seized it 
perceval rendeth open the throat and findeth the key forthwith , all redhot with the fire of the serpent 
the king cometh down , that hath no drad of aught , but cometh , rather , as he ought , to thank perceval of the goodness he had done him , and perceval seizeth him between his arms and beareth him away to the ship 
xiii 
sir knight , saith gohaz , take heed what you do , for i am king of this land 
therefore , saith perceval , i do it 
for , had it been another i should do it not 
ha , sir , saith the damsel , leave me not here to get forth as i may , but help me until that i shall be in the house of my father , the sick knight , that is sore grieved on my account 
perceval understndeth that it is the damsel of whom galobruns spake such praise 
he goeth to bring her down from the tree , then bringeth her into the ship , and so goeth back toward the rock where his cousin was 
sir knight , saith gohaz , where will you put me 
i will put you , saith he , as an enemy , there , where you have put the son of mine uncle in prison 
shall i avenge me of you , and he also at his will 
when the king heard this , he was glad thereof not a whit , and the damsel was loath not a whit , whom he had thus disherited 
they row until they come to the rock 
perceval issueth forth of the ship , and bringeth gohaz up maugre his head 
galobruns seeth him coming and maketh great joy thereof , and perceval saith to him   behold here your mortal enemy 
now do your will of him 
he taketh the key and so looseth him of the irons wherein he was imprisoned 
xiv 
galobruns , saith perceval , now may you do your pleasure of your enemy 
sir , saith he , right gladly 
he maketh fastthe irons on his feet that he had upon his own , and afterward setteth the collar on his neck 
now let him be here , saith he , in such sort and in such prison as he put me 
for well i know that he will be succoured of none 
after that , he flingeth the key into the sea as far as he might , and so seemed it to galobruns that he well avenged himself in such wise , and better than if he had killed him 
perceval alloweth him everything therein at his will 
they enter into the ship and leave gohaz all sorrowing on the rock , that never thereafter are nor drnk 
perceval bringeth his cousin and the damsel , and they row until that they come into their land , and perceval maketh send for all the folk of king gohaz and maketh all the more powerful do sure homage to galobruns and his sistrs in such sort that the land was all at their will 
he sojourned there so long as it pleased him , and then departed and took leave of the damsel and galobruns , that thanked him much for the lands that he had again through him 
xv 
perceval hath rowed until that he is come nigh a caste that was burning fiercely with a great flame , and seeth a hermitage upon the sea hard by 
he seeth the hermit at the door of the chapel , and asketh him what the caste is that hath caught fire thus 
sir , saith the hermit , i will tell you 
joseus , the son of king pelles , slew his mother there 
never sithence hath the caste stnted of burning , and i tell you that of this caste and one other will be kindled the fire that shall burn up the world and put it to an end 
perceval marvelleth much , and knew well that it was the caste of king hermit his uncle 
he departeth thence in great hast , and passeth three kingdoms and saileth by the wasts and deserts on one side and the other of the sea , for the ship ran somewhat anigh the land 
he looketh and seeth on an island twelve hermits sitting on the seashore 
the sea was calm and untroubled , and he made castthe anchor so as to keep the ship stady 
he saluteth the hermits , and they all bow down to him in answer 
he asketh them where have they their repair , and they tell him that they have not far away twelve chapels and twelve houses that surround a graveyard wherein lie twelve dead knights that we keep watch over 
they were all brothersgerman , and right worshipful men , and none thereof lived more than twelve years knight save one only , and none of them was there but won much land and broad kingdoms from the misbelievers , and they all died in arms 
the name of the eldestwas alain li gros , and he came into this country from the valleys of camelot to avenge his brother alibans of the wast city that the giant king had slain , and he took vengeance on him thereof , but he died thereafter of a wound that the giant had given him 
sir , saith one of the hermits , i was at his death , but nought was there he so longed after as a son of his , and he said that his name was perceval 
he was the lastof the brothers that died 
xvi 
when perceval heard this he had pity thereof , and issued forth of the ship and came to land , and his mariner with him 
he prayed the hermits that they would lead him to the graveyard where the knights lay , and gladly did they so 
perceval is come thither and seeth the coffins right rich and fair , and the chapels full fairly dight , and every coffin lay over againstthe altar in each chapel 
lords , which coffin is that of the lord of camelot 
this , the highest say the hermits , and the mostrich , for that he was eldestof all the brethren 
perceval kneeleth down before it , then embraceth the coffin and prayeth right sweetly for the soul of his father , and in like manner he went to all the other coffins 
he harboured the night with the hermits , and told them that alain li gros was his father and all the other his uncles 
right joyous were the hermits for that he was come thither , and the morrow , or ever he departed , he heard mass in the chapel of his father and in the others where he might 
he entered into the ship and sped full swift , and so far hath the ship run that he drweth nigh the islands of great britain 
he arriveth at the head of a forestunder the red tower whereof he had slain the lord , there where meliot delivered messire gawain 
he is issued forth of the ship and leadeth forth his horse and is armed , and commendeth the pilot to god 
he mounteth on his destier , all armed , and goeth amidstthe land that was wellnigh void of people , for he himself had slain the greater part thereof , albeit he knew it not 
he rideth so long , right amidstthe country , that he cometh toward evensong to a hold that was in a great forest and he bethought him that he would go into the hermitage , and he cometh staight into the hold , and seeth a knight lying in the entrance of the gate on a staw mattress , and a damsel sate at the bed s head , of passing great beauty , and held his head on her lap 
xvii 
the knight reviled her from time to time , and said that he would make cut of her head and he had not that he desired to have , for that he was sick 
perceval looked at the lady that held him and served him full sweetly , and deemed her to be a good lady and a loyal 
the sick knight called to perceval 
sir , saith he , are you come in hither to harbour 
sir , saith perceval , so please you , i will harbour here 
blame me not , saith the knight , of that you shall see me do unto my wife 
sir , saith perceval , sith that she is yours , you have a right to do your pleasure , but in all things ought one to be heedful on one s way 
the knight made him be carried back into the dwelling , for that he had been in the air as long as pleased him , and commanded his wife that she do much honour to the knight that is come to lodge within 
take heed , saith he , that you be not seen at the table , but eat , as you are wont , at the squire s table , for , until such time as i have the golden cup i desire , i will not forego my despite againstyou 
xviii 
perceval unarmed him 
the lady had brought him a surcoat of scarlet for him to do on , and he asked her wherefore her lord reviled her and rebuked her in such sort , and she told him all the stry how lancelot had married her to him , and how her lord ever sithence had dishonoured her 
sir , saith she , now hath he fallen into misease , sithence then , and he hath a brother as sick as he is , and therefore hath gohaz of the caste of the whale reft him of his land , whereof is he right sorry , and my lord hath never been heal since that he heard thereof 
well you know that such folk wax wroth of a little , and are overjoyed when they have a little thing that pleaseth them , for they live always in desire of somewhat 
my lord hath heard tell of a cup of gold that a damsel beareth , that is right rich and of greater worth than aught he hath seen this long time , and a knight goeth with the damsel that beareth the cup , and saith that none may have it save he be the bestknight in the world 
my lord hath told me many times , sithence he heard tidings thereof , that never shall the despite he hath toward me be forgone , until that he shall have the cup 
he is so angry withal with his brother that hath losthis land , that i aby it right dear , for i do all his will and yet may i have no fair treatment of him 
howbeit , for no ill that he may do , nor no churlishness that he may say , will i be againsthim in nought that he hath set his mind on 
for i would have him , and i had him , blessed be lancelot through whom it was so 
as much as i loved him in health , so much love i him in his sickness , and more yet , for i desire to deserve that god shall bring him to a better mind 
xix 
lady , saith perceval , great praise ought you to have of this that you say 
you may well tell him of a truth that the sick king his brother hath all his land freely and his daughter , for i was at the reconquering thereof , and know the knight well that gave it back unto him 
of the golden cup can i give you no witting sir , saith she , the damsel is to bear it to an assembly of knights that is to be held hard by this , under the white tower 
there hath she to give it to the bestknight , and him that shall do bestat the assembly , and the knight that followeth the damsel is bound to carry it whither he that shall win it may command , and if he would fain it should be given to another rather than to himself 
lady , saith perceval , well meseemeth that he who shall win the cup by prize of arms will be right courteous and he send it to you , and god grant that he that hath it may do you such bounty as you desire 
sir , saith she , methinketh well , so lancelot were there , either he or messire gawain , that , and they won it , so they remembered them of me , and knew how needful it were to me , they would promise me the cup 
lady , saith perceval , by one of these ywain ought you well to have it , for greater prize now long since have they won 
she goeth to her lord and saith to him  sir , saith she , now may you be more joyous than is your wont , for that your brother hath his land again all quit 
for the knight that is within was at the reconquering 
the sick knight heard her and had great joy thereof 
go 
saith he to his wife , and do great honour to the knight , but take heed you sit not otherwise than you are wont 
sir , saith she , i will not 
the damsel maketh perceval sit at meat 
when he had washen , he thought that the lady should have come to sit beside him , but she would not disobey her lord s commandment 
when perceval was set at the table and he had been served of the firstmeats , thereupon the lady went to sit with the squires 
perceval was much shamed that she should sit below , but he was not minded to speak , for she had told him somewhat of her lord s manner 
howbeit , he lay the night in the hold , and , on the morrow when he had taken leave , he departed , and bethought him in his courage that the knight would do good chivalry and great aims that should do this sick knight his desire as concerning the cup , in such sort as that his wife should be freed of the annoy that she is in , for that all knights that knew thereof ought to have pity of her 
perceval goeth his way as he that hath great desire to accomplish that he hath to do , and to see the token of his going again to the caste where the chain of gold appeared to him , for never yet saw he dwelling that pleased him so much 
he hath ridden so far that he is come into the joyless forestof the black hermit , that is so loathly and horrible that no leaves nor greenery are there by winter nor by summer , nor was song of bird never heard therein , but all the land is gruesome and burnt , and wide are the cracks therein 
he hath scarce gone thereinto or ever he hath overtaken the damsel of the car , that made full great joy of him 
sir , saith she , bald was i the firsttime i saw you 
now may you see that i have my hair 
certes , yea 
saith perceval , and , as methinketh , hair passing beautiful 
sir , saith she , i was wont to carry my arm at my neck in a scarf of gold and silk , for that i thought the service i did you in the hostl of king fisherman your uncle 
had been ill bestwed 
now well i see that it was not 
wherefore now carry i the one arm in the same manner as the other 
the damsel that wont to go afoot now goeth  orseback 
blessed be you that have so approved you in goodness by the good manner of your heart , and by your likeness to the firstof your lineage , whom you resemble in all good conditions 
sir , saith she , i durstnot come nigh the caste , for there be archers there that shoot so sore that none may endure their stokes , and hereof will they stnt not , they say , until such time as you be come thither 
well know i wherefore they will cease then , for they will come to shut you up within to slay and to destoy 
natheless all they that are within will have no power , nor will they do you evil , save only the lord of the caste 
he will do battle againstyou right gladly 
perceval goeth toward the caste of the black hermit , and the damsel of the car after 
the archers drw and shoot stutly 
perceval goeth forward a great gallop , but they know him not on account of the white shield 
they think rather that it is one of the other knights , and they lodge many arrows in his shield 
he came nigh a drwbridge over a moat right broad and foul and horrible , and the bridge was lowered so soon as he came , and all the archers left of shooting 
knew they well that it was perceval who came 
the door was opened to receive him , for they of the gate and they of the caste within thought to have power to slay him 
so soon as they saw him , they losttheir will thereof and were all amared and without stength , and said that they would set this business on their lord that was stong enough and puissant enough to slay one man 
perceval entered all armed into a great hall , and found it filled all around with a great throng of folk that was right foul to look on 
he that was called the black hermit was full tall and seemed to be of noble lordship , and he was in the midstof the hall , all armed 
sir , say his men , and you have not defence of yourself , never no counsel nor aid may you have of us 
we are yours to guard , to protect , and oftentimes have we defended you 
now defend us in this sore need 
the black hermit sate upon a tall black horse , and was right richly armed 
soon as perceval espieth him , he cometh with such a rush againsthim that he maketh all the hall resound , and the black hermit cometh in like sort 
they mell together with such force that the black hermit breaketh his spear upon perceval , but perceval smiteth him so passing stutly on the left side upon the shield , that he beareth him to the ground beside his horse , so that in the fall he made he tofrushed two of the great ribs in the overturn 
when they that were therein saw him fall , they opened the trapdoor of a great pit that was in the midstof the hall 
soon as they had opened it , the fouleststnch that any smelt ever issued thereout 
they take their lord and casthim into this abysm and this filth 
after that , they come to perceval , and so yield the caste and put them at his mercy in everything 
thereupon , behold you , the damsel of the car that cometh 
they deliver up to her the heads sealed in gold , both the head of the king and of the queen , and she departeth forthwith , for well knoweth she that perceval will achieve that he hath to do without her 
she departeth from the caste and goeth the speediestshe may toward the valleys of camelot 
all they of the caste that had been the black hermit s are obedient to perceval to do his will , and they have him in covenant that never more shall knights be harassed there in such sort as they had been theretofore , but rather that they should receive gladly any knights that should pass that way , like as in other places 
perceval departed from the caste rejoicing for that he had drwn them to the believe of our lord , and every day was his service done therein in holy wise , like as it is done in other places 
hereof ought the good knight to be loved that by the goodness of his heart and the loyalty of his knighthood hath achieved all the emprises he undertook , without reproach and without blame 
perceval hath ridden until he hath overtaken the damsel that carried the rich cup of gold and the knight that was along with her 
perceval saluteth him , and the knight maketh answer , may he be blessed of god and of his sweet mother 
fair sir , saith perceval , is this damsel of your company 
saith the knight , rather am i of hers 
we are going to an assembly of knights that is to be under the white tower to the intent to prove which knight is mostworth , and to him that shall have the prize of the assembly shall be delivered this golden cup 
by my head , saith perceval , that will be fair to see 
he departeth from the knight and the damsel , and goeth his way a great pace amidstthe meadows under the white tower , whither the knights were coming from all parts , and many of them were already armed to issue forth 
soon as it was known that the damsel with the cup was come thither , the fellowships assembled on all sides , and great was the clashing of arms 
perceval hurleth into the assembly in such sort that many a knight he smiteth down and overthroweth at his coming , and he giveth so many blows and so many receiveth that all they that behold marvel much how he may abide 
the assembly lastd until evensong , and when it came to an end the damsel came to the knights and prayed and required that they would declare to her by right judgment of arms which had done the best  the more part said that he of the white shield had surpassed them all in arms , and all agreed thereto 
the damsel was right glad , for well she knew that they spake truth 
she cometh to perceval 
sir , saith she , i present you this cup of gold for your good chivalry , and therefore is it meet and right you should know whence the cup cometh 
the elder damsel of the tent where the evil custm was wont to be , sent it to messire gawain , and messire gawain made much joy thereof 
it came to pass on such wise that brundans , the son of the sistr of briant of the isles , slew meliot of logres , the mostcourteous knight and the mostvaliant that was in the realm of logres , and thereof was messire gawain so sorrowful that he knew not how to contain himself 
for meliot had twice rescued him from death , and king arthur once 
he was liegeman of messire gawain 
wherefore he prayeth and beseecheth you on his behalf that you receive not the cup save you undertake to avenge him 
for he was loved of all the court , albeit he had haunted it but little 
brundans slew him in treason when meliot was unawares of him 
damsel , saith perceval , were there no cup at all , yet natheless should i be fain to do the will of messire gawain , for never might i love the man that had deserved his hatred 
he taketh the cup in his hand 
damsel , saith he , i thank you much hereof , and god grant i may reward you for the same 
sir , saith she , brundans is a right proud knight , and beareth a shield party of vert and argent 
he is minded never to change his cognisance , for that his father bore the same 
perceval called the knight that was of the damsel s company 
i beseech you , saith he , of guerdon and of service , that you bear this cup for me to the hold of the sick knight , and tell his wife that the knight of the white shield that was harboured there within hath sent it her by you 
sir , saith the knight , this will i do gladly to fulfil your will 
he taketh the cup to furnish out the conditions of the message , and so departeth forthwith 
perceval lay the night in the caste of the white tower , and departed thence on the morrow as he that would fain do somewhat whereof he might deserve well of messire gawain 
many a time had he heard tell of meliot of logres and of his chivalry and of his great valour 
he was entered into a forest and had heard mass of a hermit , from whom he had departed 
he came to the caste perilous that was hard by there where meliot lay sick , lay wounded , when lancelot brought him the sword and the cloth wherewith he touched his wounds 
he entered into the caste and alighted 
the damsel of the caste , that made great dole , came to meet perceval 
damsel , saith he , wherefore are you so sorrowful 
sir , saith she , for a knight that i tended and healed herewithin , whom brundans hath killed in treason , and god thereof grant us vengeance yet , for so courteous knight saw i never 
while she was speaking in this manner , forthwith behold you a damsel that cometh 
ha , sir , saith she to perceval , mount you again and come to aid us , for none other knight find i in this land nor in this forestbut only you all alone 
what need have you of my aid 
saith perceval 
a knight is carrying off my lady by force , that was going to the court of king arthur 
who is your lady 
saith perceval 
sir , she is the younger damsel of the tent where messire gawain overthrew the evil custms 
for god s sake , hastn you , for he revileth her sore for her love of the king and of messire gawain 
perceval remounteth forthwith and issueth forth of the caste on the spur 
the damsel bringeth him on as fastas the knight can go 
they had not ridden far before they came anigh , and perceval heard the damsel crying aloud for mercy , and the knight said that mercy upon her he would not have , and so smote her on the head and neck with the fiat of his sword 
perceval espied the knight and saw that the cognisance of his shield was such as that which had been set forth to him 
sir , saith he , too churlishly are you entreating this damsel 
what wrong hath she done you 
what is it to you of me and of her 
i say it saith perceval , for that no knight ought to do churlishly to damsel 
he will not stnt for you yet 
saith brundans 
he raiseth his sword and dealeth the damsel a buffet with the fiat so passing heavy that it maketh her stop withal so that the blood rayeth out at mouth and nose 
by my head , saith perceval , on this buffet i defy thee , for the death of meliot and for the shame you have done this damsel 
neither you nor none other may brag that you have heart to attack me , but you shall aby it right dear 
that shall you see presently , saith perceval and so drweth back the better to let drve at him , and moveth towards him as fastas his horse may run , and smiteth him so passing sore that he pierceth his shield and burstth his habergeon and then thrustth his spear into his body with such force that he overthroweth him all in a heap , him and his horse , in such sort that he breaketh both legs in the fall 
he alighteth over him , lowereth his coif , unlaceth the ventail , and smiteth off his head 
damsel , saith he , take it , i present it to you 
sith that you are going to king arthur s court , i pray and beseech you that you carry it thither and so salute him firstfor me , and tell messire gawain and lancelot that this is the lastpresent i look ever to make them , for i think never to see them more 
howbeit , wheresoever i may be , i shall be their wellwisher , nor may i never withdrw me of my love , and i would fain i might make them the same present of the heads of all their enemies , but that i may do nought againstgod s will 
the damsel giveth him thanks for that he hath delivered her from the hands of the knight , and saith that she shall praise him much thereof to the king and messire gawain 
she goeth her way and carrieth off the head , and perceval biddeth her to god 
he returned back to caste perilous , and the damsel made great joy thereof when she understod that he had slain brundans 
perceval lay there that night , and departed on the morrow after that he had heard mass 
when he came forth of the caste he met the knight by whom he had sent the cup to the sick knight s wife 
perceval asketh how it is with him 
sir , saith he , i have carried out your message right well , for never was a thing received with such good will 
the sick knight hath forgone his grudge againsthis wife 
she eateth at his table , and the household do her commandment 
this liketh me right well , saith perceval , and i thank you of doing this errand 
sir , saith the knight , no thing is there i would not do for you , for that you made my brother knight hardy there where you firstsaw him knight coward 
sir , saith perceval , good knight was your brother and a right good end he made , but a little it forthinketh me that he might have stll been living had he abided in his cowardize 
sir , saith he , better is he dead , sith that he died with honour , than that he should live with shame 
yet glad was i not of his death , for a hardy knight he was , and yet more would have been , had he lived longer 
perceval departeth from the knight and commendeth him to god 
he hath wandered so far one day and another that he is returned to his own mostholy caste , and findeth therein his mother and his sistr that the damsel of the car had brought thither 
the widow lady had made bear thither the body that lay in the coffin before the caste of camelot in the rich chapel that she had builded there 
his sistr brought the cerecloth that she took in the wast chapel , and presented there where the graal was 
perceval made bring the coffin of the other knight that was at the entrance of his caste within the chapel likewise , and place it beside the coffin of his uncle , nor never thereafter might it be removed 
josephus telleth us that perceval was in this caste long time , nor never once moved therefrom in questof no adventure 
rather was his courage so attorned to the saviour of the world and his sweet mother , that he and his sistr and the damsel that was therein led a holy life and a religious 
therein abode they even as it pleased god , until that his mother passed away and his sistr and all they that were therein save he alone 
the hermits that were nigh the caste buried them and sang their masses , and came every day and took counsel of him for the holiness they saw him do and the good life that he led there 
one day whilsthe was in the holy chapel where the hallows were , forthwith , behold you , a voice that cometh down therein  perceval , saith the voice , not long shall you abide herein 
wherefore it is god s will that you dispart the hallows amongstthe hermits of the forest there where these bodies shall be served and worshipped , and the mostholy graal shall appear herein no more , but within a brief space shall you know well the place where it shall be 
when the voice departed , all the coffins that were therein crashed so passing loud that it seemed the mastrhall had fallen 
he crosseth and blesseth him and commendeth him to god 
on a day the hermits came to him 
he disparted the holy relics among them , and they builded above them holy churches and houses of religion that are seen in the lands and in the islands 
joseus the son of king hermit , remained therein with perceval , for he well knew that he would be departing thence betimes 
perceval heard one day a bell sound loud and high without the manor toward the sea 
he came to the windows of the hall and saw the ship come with the white sail and the red cross thereon , and within were the fairestfolk that ever he might behold , and they were all robed in such manner as though they should sing mass 
when the ship was anchored under the hall they went to pray in the mostholy chapel 
they brought the richestvessels of gold and silver that any might ever see , like as it were coffins , and set therein one of the three bodies of knights that had been brought into the chapel , and the body of king fisherman , and of the mother of perceval 
no savour in the world smelleth so sweet 
perceval took leave of joseus and commended him to the saviour of the world , and took leave of the household , from whom he departed in like manner 
the worshipful men that were in the ship signed them of the cross and blessed them likewise 
the ship wherein perceval was drw far away , and a voice that issued from the manor as she departed commended them to god and to his sweet mother 
josephus recordeth us that perceval departed in such wise , nor never thereafter did no earthly man know what became of him , nor doth the histry speak of him more 
the histry telleth us that joseus abode in the caste that had been king fisherman s , and shut himself up therein so that none might enter , and lived upon that the lord god might send him 
he dwelt there long time after that perceval had departed , and ended therein 
after his end , the dwelling began to fall 
natheless never was the chapel wastd nor decayed , but was as whole thereafter as tofore and is so stll 
the place was far from folk , and the place seemed withal to be somewhat different 
when it was fallen into decay , many folk of the lands and islands that were nighestthereunto marvel them what may be in this manor 
they dare a many that they should go see what was therein , and sundr folk went thither from all the lands , but none durstnever enter there again save two welsh knights that had heard tell of it 
full comely knights they were , young and joyous hearted 
either pledged him to other that they would go thither by way of gay adventure 
therein remained they of a long space after , and when again they came forth they led the life of hermits , and clad them in hair shirts , and went by the forestand so ate nought save roots only , and led a right hard life 
yet ever they made as though they were glad , and if that any should ask whereof they rejoiced in such wise , go , said they to them that asked , thither where we have been , and you shall know the wherefore 
in such sort made they answer to the folk 
these two knights died in this holy life , nor were none other tidings never brought thence by them 
they of that land called them saints 
here endeth the stry of the mostholy graal 
josephus , by whom it is placed on record , giveth the benison of our lord to all that hear and honour it 
the latin from whence this histry was drwn into romance was taken in the isle of avalon , in a holy house of religion that stndeth at the head of the moors adventurous , there where king arthur and queen guenievre lie , according to the witness of the good men religious that are therein , that have the whole histry thereof , true from the beginning even to the end 
after this same histry beginneth the stry how briant of the isles renounced king arthur on account of lancelot whom he loved not , and how he assured king claudas that reft king ban of benoic of his land 
this stry telleth how he conquered him and by what means , and how galobrus of the red launde came to king arthur s court to help lancelot , for that he was of his lineage 
this stry is right long and right adventurous and weighty , but the book will now forthwith be silent thereof until another time 
the author s conclusion for the lord of neele made the lord of cambrein this book be written , that never tofore was treated in romance but one single time besides this 
the book that was made tofore this is so ancient that only with great pains may one make out the letter 
let messire johan de neele well understnd that he ought to hold this stry dear , nor ought he tell nought thereof to ill understnding folk , for a good thing that is squandered upon bad folk is never remembered by them for good 
explicit the romance of perceval the nephew of king fisherman

you say that the women of our society live for a different interestfrom that which actuates fallen women 
i say no , and i am going to prove it to you 
if beings differ from one another according to the purpose of their life , according to their inner life , this will necessarily be reflected also in their outer life , and their exterior will be very different 
well , then , compare the wretched , the despised , with the women of the highestsociety  the same drsses , the same fashions , the same perfumeries , the same passion for jewelry , for brilliant and very expensive articles , the same amusements , dances , music , and songs 
the former attract by all possible means 
do the latter 
no difference , none whatever 
yes , and i , too , was captivated by jerseys , bustes , and curly hair 
chapter vii 
it was very easy to capture me , since i was brought up under artificial conditions , like cucumbers in a hothouse 
our too abundant nourishment , together with complete physical idleness , is nothing but systmatic excitement of the imagination 
the men of our society are fed and kept like reproductive stllions 
it is sufficient to close the valve ,that is , for a young man to live a quiet life for some time ,to produce as an immediate result a restessness , which , becoming exaggerated by reflection through the prism of our unnatural life , provokes the illusion of love 
all our idyls and marriage , all , are the result for the mostpart of our eating 
does that astnish you 
for my part , i am astnished that we do not see it 
not far from my estte this spring some moujiks were working on a railway embankment 
you frugal nourishment he lives , he is alert , he makes light work in the fields 
on the railway this bill of fare becomes cacha and a pound of meat 
only he restres this meat by sixteen hours of labor pushing loads weighing twelve hundrd pounds 
we , who eat two pounds of meat and game , we who absorb all sorts of heating drnks and food , how do we expend it 
in sensual excesses 
if the valve is open , all goes well 
close it , as i had closed it temporarily before my marriage , and immediately there will result an excitement which , deformed by novels , verses , music , by our idle and luxurious life , will give a love of the finestwater 
i , too , fell in love , as everybody does , and there were transports , emotions , poesy 
really all this passion was prepared by mamma and the drssmakers 
if there had been no trips in boats , no wellfitted garments , etc 
 , if my wife had worn some shapeless blouse , and i had seen her thus at her home , i should not have been seduced 
chapter viii 
note , also , this falsehood , of which all are guilty 
the way in which marriages are made 
what could there be more natural 
the young girl is marriageable , she should marry 
what simpler , provided the young person is not a monstr , and men can be found with a desire to marry 
well , no , here begins a new hypocrisy 
formerly , when the maiden arrived at a favorable age , her marriage was arranged by her parents 
that was done , that is done stll , throughout humanity , among the chinese , the hindoos , the mussulmans , and among our common people also 
things are so managed in at leastninetynine per cent 
of the families of the entire human race 
only we riotous livers have imagined that this way was bad , and have invented another 
this other ,what is it 
it is this 
the young girls are seated , and the gentlemen walk up and down before them , as in a bazaar , and make their choice 
the maidens wait and think ,  but do not dare to say   take me , young man , me and not her 
look at these shoulders and the rest   we males walk up and down , and estmate the merchandise , and then we discourse upon the rights of woman , upon the liberty that she acquires , i know not how , in the theatrical halls 
what is to be done 
shall the woman make the advances 
i do not know 
if it is a queston of equality , let the equality be complete 
though it has been found that to contract marriages through the agency of matchmakers is humiliating , it is nevertheless a thousand times preferable to our systm 
there the rights and the chances are equal 
here the woman is a slave , exhibited in the market 
as she cannot bend to her condition , or make advances herself , there begins that other and more abominable lie which is sometimes called going into society , sometimes amusing one s self , and which is really nothing but the hunt for a husband 
say to a mother or to her daughter that they are engaged only in a hunt for a husband 
god 
what an offence 
yet they can do nothing else , and have nothing else to do 
the terrible feature of it all is to see sometimes very young , poor , and innocent maidens haunted solely by such ideas 
if only , i repeat , it were done frankly 
it is always accompanied with lies and babble of this sort     , the descent of species 
how interestng it is 
oh , lily is much interestd in painting 
shall you go to the exposition 
how charming it is 
the troika , and the plays , and the symphony 
 , how adorable 
my lise is passionately fond of music 
you , why do you not share these convictions 
through all this verbiage , all have but one single idea   take me , take my lise 
no , me 
only try 
chapter ix 
do you know , suddenly continued posdnicheff , that this power of women from which the world suffers arises solely from what i have justspoken of 
what do you mean by the power of women 
i said 
everybody , on the contrary , complains that women have not sufficient rights , that they are in subjection 
that s it 
that s it exactly , said he , vivaciously 
that is justwhat i mean , and that is the explanation of this extraordinary phenomenon , that on the one hand woman is reduced to the lowestdegree of humiliation and on the other hand she reigns over everything 
see the jews  with their power of money , they avenge their subjection , justas the women do 

you wish us to be only merchants 
all right 
remaining merchants , we will get possession of you ,  say the jews 

you wish us to be only objects of sensuality 
all right 
by the aid of sensuality we will bend you beneath our yoke ,  say the women 
the absence of the rights of woman does not consistin the fact that she has not the right to vote , or the right to sit on the bench , but in the fact that in her affectional relations she is not the equal of man , she has not the right to abstin , to choose instad of being chosen 
you say that that would be abnormal 
very well 
then do not let man enjoy these rights , while his companion is deprived of them , and finds herself obliged to make use of the coquetry by which she governs , so that the result is that man chooses  formally ,  whereas really it is woman who chooses 
as soon as she is in possession of her means , she abuses them , and acquires a terrible supremacy 
where do you see this exceptional power 
where 
why , everywhere , in everything 
go see the stres in the large cities 
there are millions there , millions 
it is impossible to estmate the enormous quantity of labor that is expended there 
in ninetenths of these stres is there anything whatever for the use of men 
all the luxury of life is demanded and sustined by woman 
count the factories 
the greater part of them are engaged in making feminine ornaments 
millions of men , generations of slaves , die toiling like convicts simply to satisfy the whims of our companions 
women , like queens , keep ninetenths of the  human race as prisoners of war , or as prisoners at hard labor 
all this because they have been humiliated , because they have been deprived of rights equal to those which men enjoy 
they take revenge for our sensuality 
they catch us in their nets 
yes , the whole thing is there 
women have made of themselves such a weapon to act upon the senses that a young man , and even an old man , cannot remain tranquil in their presence 
watch a popular festval , or our receptions or ballrooms 
woman well knows her influence there 
you will see it in her triumphant smiles 
as soon as a young man advances toward a woman , directly he falls under the influence of this opium , and loses his head 
long ago i felt ill at ease when i saw a woman too well adorned ,whether a woman of the people with her red neckerchief and her looped skirt , or a woman of our own society in her ballroom drss 
now it simply terrifies me 
i see in it a danger to men , something contrary to the laws 
i feel a desire to call a policeman , to appeal for defence from some quarter , to demand that this dangerous object be removed 
this is not a joke , by any means 
i am convinced , i am sure , that the time will comeand perhaps it is not far distntwhen the world will understnd this , and will be astnished that a society could existin which actions as harmful as those which appeal to sensuality by adorning the body as our companions do were allowed 
as well set traps along our public steets , or worse than that 
chapter x 
that , then , was the way in which i was captured 
i was in love , as it is called 
not only did she appear to me a perfect being , but i considered myself a white blackbird 
it is a commonplace fact that there is no one so low in the world that he cannot find some one viler than himself , and consequently puff with pride and selfcontentment 
i was in that situation 
i did not marry for money 
interestwas foreign to the affair , unlike the marriages of mostof my acquaintances , who married either for money or for relations 
first i was rich , she was poor 
second , i was especially proud of the fact that , while others married with an intention of continuing their polygamic life as bachelors , it was my firm intention to live monogamically after my engagement and the wedding , and my pride swelled immeasurably 
yes , i was a wretch , convinced that i was an angel 
the period of my engagement did not lastlong 
i cannot remember those days without shame 
what an abomination 
it is generally agreed that love is a moral sentiment , a community of thought rather than of sense 
if that is the case , this community of thought ought to find expression in words and conversation 
nothing of the sort 
it was extremely difficult for us to talk with each other 
what a toil of sisyphus was our conversation 
scarcely had we thought of something to say , and said it , when we had to r‚sum‚ our silence and try to discover new subjects 
literally , we did not know what to say to each other 
all that we could think of concerning the life that was before us and our home was said 
then what 
if we had been animals , we should have known that we had not to talk 
here , on the contrary , it was necessary to talk , and there were no resources 
for that which occupied our minds was not a thing to be expressed in words 
then that silly custm of eating bonbons , that brutal gluttony for sweetmeats , those abominable preparations for the wedding , those discussions with mamma upon the apartments , upon the sleepingrooms , upon the bedding , upon the morninggowns , upon the wrappers , the linen , the costmes 
understnd that if people married according to the old fashion , as this old man said justnow , then these eiderdown coverlets and this bedding would all be sacred details 
with us , out of ten married people there is scarcely to be found one who , i do not say believes in sacraments  , he said , why did you almostcrush the life out of the old grandmother 
be more gentle 
i have plenty more , and i will give them to you 
whereupon he began throwing about more of the coins 
the people gathered around him , and ivan continued throwing until he emptied his bag 
they clamored for more , but ivan replied  the gold is all gone 
another time i will give you more 
now we will r‚sum‚ our singing and dancing 
the little childrn sang , but ivan said to them , your songs are no good 
the childrn said , then show us how to sing better 
to this ivan replied , i will show you people who can sing better than you 
with that remark ivan went to the barn and , securing a bundle of staw , did as the little devil had directed him 
presently a regiment of soldiers appeared in the village steet , and he ordered them to sing and dance 
the people were astnished and could not understnd how ivan had produced the stangers 
the soldiers sang for some time , to the great delight of the villagers 
when ivan commanded them to stp they instntly ceased 
ivan then ordered them off to the barn , telling the astnished and mystfied moujiks that they mustnot follow him 
reaching the barn , he turned the soldiers again into staw and went home to sleep off the effects of his debauch 
chapter vii 
the next morning ivan s exploits were the talk of the village , and news of the wonderful things he had done reached the ears of his brother simeon , who immediately went to ivan to learn all about it 
explain to me , he said 
from whence did you bring the soldiers , and where did you take them 
what do you wish to know for 
asked ivan 
why , with soldiers we can do almostanything we wishwhole kingdoms can be conquered , replied simeon 
this information greatly surprised ivan , who said  well , why did you not tell me about this before 
i can make as many as you want 
ivan then took his brother to the barn , but he said  while i am willing to create the soldiers , you musttake them away from here 
for if it should become necessary to feed them , all the food in the village would lastthem only one day 
simeon promised to do as ivan wished , whereupon ivan proceeded to convert the staw into soldiers 
out of one bundle of staw he made an entire regiment 
in fact , so many soldiers appeared as if by magic that there was not a vacant spot in the field 
turning to simeon ivan said , well , is there a sufficient number 
beaming with joy , simeon replied  enough 
enough 
thank you , ivan 
glad you are satisfied , said ivan , and if you wish more i will make them for you 
i have plenty of staw now 
simeon divided his soldiers into battalions and regiments , and after having drlled them he went forth to fight and to conquer 
simeon had justgotten safely out of the village with his soldiers when tarras , the other brother , appeared before ivanhe also having heard of the previous day s performance and wanting to learn the secret of his power 
he sought ivan , saying  tell me the secret of your supply of gold , for if i had plenty of money i could with its assistnce gather in all the wealth in the world 
ivan was greatly surprised on hearing this sttement , and said  you might have told me this before , for i can obtain for you as much money as you wish 
tarras was delighted , and he said , you might get me about three bushels 
well , said ivan , we will go to the woods , or , better stll , we will harness the horse , as we could not possibly carry so much money ourselves 
the brothers went to the woods and ivan proceeded to gather the oak leaves , which he rubbed between his hands , the dustfalling to the ground and turning into gold pieces as quickly as it fell 
when quite a pile had accumulated ivan turned to tarras and asked if he had rubbed enough leaves into money , whereupon tarras replied  thank you , ivan 
that will be sufficient for this time 
ivan then said  if you wish more , come to me and i will rub as much as you want , for there are plenty of leaves 
tarras , with his tarantas  tax return

love of life and other stries by jack london scanned and proofed by david price ccx074@coventry 
ac 
uk love of life and other stries love of life this out of all will remain  they have lived and have tossed  so much of the game will be gain , though the gold of the dice has been lost they limped painfully down the bank , and once the foremostof the  two men stggered among the roughstewn rocks 
they were tired  and weak , and their faces had the drwn expression of patience  which comes of hardship long endured 
they were heavily burdened  with blanket packs which were stapped to their shoulders 
head staps , passing across the forehead , helped support these packs 
each man carried a rifle 
they walked in a stoped postre , the  shoulders well forward , the head stll farther forward , the eyes  bent upon the ground 
i wish we had justabout two of them cartridges that s layin  in  that cache of ourn , said the second man 
his voice was utterly and drarily expressionless 
he spoke  without enthusiasm 
the firstman , limping into the milky  steam that foamed over the rocks , vouchsafed no reply 
the other man followed at his heels 
they did not remove their  footgear , though the water was icy cold  so cold that their  ankles ached and their feet went numb 
in places the water dashed  againsttheir knees , and both men stggered for footing 
the man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder , nearly fell , but  recovered himself with a violent effort , at the same time uttering  a sharp exclamation of pain 
he seemed faint and dizzy and put out  his free hand while he reeled , as though seeking support against the air 
when he had stadied himself he stpped forward , but  reeled again and nearly fell 
he stod stll and looked at  the other man , who had never turned his head 
the man stod stll for fully a minute , as though debating with  himself 
he called out  i say , bill , i have sprained my ankle 
bill stggered on through the milky water 
he did not look around 
the man watched him go , and though his face was expressionless as  ever , his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer 
the other man limped up the farther bank and continued staight on  without looking back 
the man in the steam watched him 
his lips  trembled a little , so that the rough thatch of brown hair which  covered them was visibly agitated 
his tongue even stayed out to  moistn them 
bill 
he cried out 
it was the pleading cry of a stong man in distess , but bill s  head did not turn 
the man watched him go , limping grotesquely and  lurching forward with stmmering gait up the slow slope toward the  soft skyline of the lowlying hill 
he watched him go till he  passed over the crestand disappeared 
he turned his gaze and  slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now  that bill was gone 
near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly , almostobscured by  formless mist and vapors , which gave an impression of mass and  density without outline or tangibility 
the man pulled out his  watch , the while restng his weight on one leg 
it was four  o clock , and as the season was near the lastof july or firstof  august  he did not know the precise date within a week or two ,   he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest  he looked to  the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the  great bear lake 
also , he knew that in that direction the arctic  circle cut its forbidding way across the canadian barrens 
this  steam in which he stod was a feeder to the coppermine river ,  which in turn flowed north and emptied into coronation gulf and the  arctic ocean 
he had never been there , but he had seen it , once ,  on a hudson bay company chart 
again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him 
it was  not a heartening spectacle 
everywhere was soft skyline 
the  hills were all lowlying 
there were no trees , no shrubs , no  grasses  naught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent  fear swiftly dawning into his eyes 
bill 
he whispered , once and twice 
bill 
he cowered in the midstof the milky water , as though the vastess  were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force , brutally  crushing him with its complacent awfulness 
he began to shake as  with an aguefit , till the gun fell from his hand with a splash 
this served to rouse him 
he fought with his fear and pulled  himself together , groping in the water and recovering the weapon 
he hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder , so as to  take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle 
he  proceeded , slowly and carefully , wincing with pain , to the bank 
he did not stp 
with a desperation that was madness , unmindful of  the pain , he hurried up the slope to the crestof the hill over  which his comrde had disappeared  more grotesque and comical by  far than that limping , jerking comrde 
at the cresthe saw a  shallow valley , empty of life 
he fought with his fear again ,  overcame it , hitched the pack stll farther over on his left  shoulder , and lurched on down the slope 
the bottom of the valley was soggy with water , which the thick moss  held , spongelike , close to the surface 
this water squirted out  from under his feet at every stp , and each time he lifted a foot  the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss  reluctantly released its grip 
he picked his way from muskeg to  muskeg , and followed the other man s footstps along and across the  rocky ledges which thrustlike islets through the sea of moss 
though alone , he was not lost  farther on he knew he would come to  where dead spruce and fir , very small and weazened , bordered the  shore of a little lake , the titchinnichilie , in the tongue of the  country , the land of little stcks 
into that lake flowed a  small steam , the water of which was not milky 
there was rush grass on that steam  this he remembered well  but no timber , and  he would follow it till its firsttrickle ceased at a divide 
he  would cross this divide to the firsttrickle of another steam ,  flowing to the west which he would follow until it emptied into  the river dease , and here he would find a cache under an upturned  canoe and piled over with many rocks 
in this cache would be  ammunition for his empty gun , fishhooks and lines , a small net   all the utilities for the killing and snaring of food 
also , he  would find flour ,  not much ,  a piece of bacon , and some beans 
bill would be waiting for him there , and they would paddle away  south down the dease to the great bear lake 
south across the  lake they would go , ever south , till they gained the mackenzie 
south , stll south , they would go , while the winter raced  vainly after them , and the ice formed in the eddies , and the days  grew chill and crisp , south to some warm hudson bay company post  where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end 
these were the thoughts of the man as he stove onward 
hard  as he stove with his body , he stove equally hard with his mind ,  trying to think that bill had not deserted him , that bill would  surely wait for him at the cache 
he was compelled to think this  thought , or else there would not be any use to stive , and he would  have lain down and died 
as the dim ball of the sun sank  slowly into the northwesthe covered every inch  and many times   of his and bill s flight south before the downcoming winter 
he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the hudson bay  company postover and over again 
he had not eaten for two days 
for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat 
often  he stoped and picked pale muskeg berries , put them into his mouth ,  and chewed and swallowed them 
a muskeg berry is a bit of seed  enclosed in a bit of water 
in the mouth the water melts away and  the seed chews sharp and bitter 
the man knew there was no  nourishment in the berries , but he chewed them patiently with a  hope greater than knowledge and defying experience 
at nine o clock he stbbed his toe on a rocky ledge , and from sheer  weariness and weakness stggered and fell 
he lay for some time ,  without movement , on his side 
he slipped out of the pack staps and clumsily drgged himself into a sitting postre 
it was  not yet dark , and in the lingering twilight he groped about among  the rocks for shreds of dr moss 
when he had gathered a heap he  built a fire ,  a smouldering , smudgy fire ,  and put a tin pot of  water on to boil 
he unwrapped his pack and the firstthing he did was to count his  matches 
there were sixtyseven 
he counted them three times to  make sure 
he divided them into several portions , wrapping them in  oil paper , disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch , of  another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat , of a third  bunch under his shirt on the chest  this accomplished , a panic  came upon him , and he unwrapped them all and counted them again 
there were stll sixtyseven 
he dred his wet footgear by the fire 
the moccasins were in  soggy shreds 
the blanket socks were worn through in places , and  his feet were raw and bleeding 
his ankle was throbbing , and he  gave it an examination 
it had swollen to the size of his knee 
he tore a long stip from one of his two blankets and bound the  ankle tightly 
he tore other stips and bound them about his feet  to serve for both moccasins and socks 
he drnk the pot of  water , staming hot , wound his watch , and crawled between his  blankets 
he slept like a dead man 
the brief darkness around midnight came  and went 
the sun arose in the northeast at leastthe day dawned  in that quarter , for the sun was hidden by gray clouds 
at six o clock he awoke , quietly lying on his back 
he gazed  staight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry 
as he  rolled over on his elbow he was strtled by a loud snort , and saw a  bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity 
the animal was  not mere than fifty feet away , and instntly into the man s mind  leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou stak sizzling and  frying over a fire 
mechanically he reached for the empty gun ,  drw a bead , and pulled the trigger 
the bull snorted and leaped  away , his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the  ledges 
the man cursed and flung the empty gun from him 
he groaned aloud  as he strted to drg himself to his feet 
it was a slow and  arduous task 
his joints were like rust hinges 
they worked harshly in their  sockets , with much friction , and each bending or unbending was  accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will 
when he  finally gained his feet , another minute or so was consumed in  staightening up , so that he could stnd erect as a man should  stnd 
he crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect 
there were  no trees , no bushes , nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely  diversified by gray rocks , gray lakelets , and gray steamlets 
the  sky was gray 
there was no sun nor hint of sun 
he had no idea of  north , and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the  night before 
he was not lost  he knew that 
on he would  come to the land of the little stcks 
he felt that it lay off to  the left somewhere , not far  possibly justover the next low hill 
he went back to put his pack into shape for travelling 
he assured  himself of the existnce of his three separate parcels of matches ,  though he did not stp to count them 
he did linger , debating ,  over a squat moosehide sack 
it was not large 
he could hide it  under his two hands 
he knew that it weighed fifteen pounds ,  as  much as all the restof the pack ,  and it worried him 
he finally  set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack 
he paused to  gaze at the squat moosehide sack 
he picked it up hastly with a  defiant glance about him , as though the desolation were trying to  rob him of it 
when he rose to his feet to stgger on into the  day , it was included in the pack on his back 
he bore away to the left , stpping now and again to eat muskeg  berries 
his ankle had stffened , his limp was more pronounced ,  but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his  stmach 
the hunger pangs were sharp 
they gnawed and gnawed  until he could not keep his mind stady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little stcks 
the muskeg berries did  not allay this gnawing , while they made his tongue and the roof of  his mouth sore with their irritating bite 
he came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings  from the ledges and muskegs 
ker  ker  ker was the cry they  made 
he threw stnes at them , but could not hit them 
he placed  his pack on the ground and stlked them as a cat stlks a sparrow 
the sharp rocks cut through his pants  legs till his knees left a  trail of blood 
the hurt was lostin the hurt of his hunger 
he squirmed over the wet moss , saturating his clothes and chilling  his body 
he was not aware of it , so great was his fever for  food 
always the ptarmigan rose , whirring , before him , till  their ker  ker  ker became a mock to him , and he cursed them and  cried aloud at them with their own cry 
once he crawled upon one that musthave been asleep 
he did not  see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook 
he made a  clutch as strtled as was the rise of the ptarmigan , and there  remained in his hand three tailfeathers 
as he watched its flight  he hated it , as though it had done him some terrible wrong 
he returned and shouldered his pack 
as the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was  more plentiful 
a band of caribou passed by , twenty and odd  animals , tantalizingly within rifle range 
he felt a wild desire  to run after them , a certitude that he could run them down 
a  black fox came toward him , carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth 
the  man shouted 
it was a fearful cry , but the fox , leaping away in  fright , did not drp the ptarmigan 
late in the afternoon he followed a steam , milky with lime , which  ran through sparse patches of rushgrass 
grasping these rushes  firmly near the root , he pulled up what resembled a young onion sprout no larger than a shinglenail 
it was tender , and his teeth  sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food 
its fibers were tough 
it was composed of stingy filaments  saturated with water , like the berries , and devoid of nourishment 
he threw off his pack and went into the rushgrass on hands and  knees , crunching and munching , like some bovine creature 
he was very weary and often wished to rest to lie down and sleep 
he was continually drven on  not so much by his desire to  gain the land of little stcks as by his hunger 
he searched  little ponds for frogs and dug up the earth with his nails for  worms , though he knew in spite that neither frogs nor worms existd  so far north 
he looked into every pool of water vainly , until , as the long  twilight came on , he discovered a solitary fish , the size of a  minnow , in such a pool 
he plunged his arm in up to the shoulder ,  but it eluded him 
he reached for it with both hands and strred  up the milky mud at the bottom 
in his excitement he fell in ,  wetting himself to the waist  then the water was too muddy to  admit of his seeing the fish , and he was compelled to wait until  the sediment had settled 
the pursuit was renewed , till the water was again muddied 
he  could not wait 
he unstapped the tin bucket and began to bale the  pool 
he baled wildly at first splashing himself and flinging the  water so short a distnce that it ran back into the pool 
he  worked more carefully , stiving to be cool , though his heart was  pounding againsthis chestand his hands were trembling 
at the  end of half an hour the pool was nearly dr 
not a cupful of water  remained 
there was no fish 
he found a hidden crevice among  the stnes through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger  pool  a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day 
had  he known of the crevice , he could have closed it with a rock at the  beginning and the fish would have been his 
thus he thought , and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth 
at firsthe cried softly to himself , then he cried loudly to the  pitiless desolation that ringed him around 
for a long time  after he was shaken by great dr sobs 
he built a fire and warmed himself by drnking quarts of hot water ,  and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night  before 
the lastthing he did was to see that his matches were dr  and to wind his watch 
the blankets were wet and clammy 
his  ankle pulsed with pain 
he knew only that he was hungry , and  through his restess sleep he dramed of feast and banquets and of  food served and spread in all imaginable ways 
he awoke chilled and sick 
there was no sun 
the gray of earth  and sky had become deeper , more profound 
a raw wind was blowing ,  and the firstflurries of snow were whitening the hilltops 
the  air about him thickened and grew white while he made a fire and  boiled more water 
it was wet snow , half rain , and the flakes were  large and soggy 
at firstthey melted as soon as they came in  contact with the earth , but ever more fell , covering the ground ,  putting out the fire , spoiling his supply of mossfuel 
this was a signal for him to stap on his pack and stmble onward ,  he knew not where 
he was not concerned with the land of little  stcks , nor with bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the  river dease 
he was mastred by the verb to eat 
he was hunger mad 
he took no heed of the course he pursued , so long as that  course led him through the swale bottoms 
he felt his way through  the wet snow to the watery muskeg berries , and went by feel as he  pulled up the rushgrass by the roots 
it was tastless stff  and did not satisfy 
he found a weed that tastd sour and he ate  all he could find of it , which was not much , for it was a creeping  growth , easily hidden under the several inches of snow 
he had no fire that night , nor hot water , and crawled under his  blanket to sleep the broken hungersleep 
the snow turned into a  cold rain 
he awakened many times to feel it falling on his  upturned face 
day came  a gray day and no sun 
it had ceased  raining 
the keenness of his hunger had departed 
sensibility , as  far as concerned the yearning for food , had been exhaustd 
there  was a dull , heavy ache in his stmach , but it did not bother him so  much 
he was more rational , and once more he was chiefly  interestd in the land of little stcks and the cache by the river  dease 
he ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into stips and bound  his bleeding feet 
also , he recinched the injured ankle and  prepared himself for a day of travel 
when he came to his pack , he  paused long over the squat moosehide sack , but in the end it went  with him 
the snow had melted under the rain , and only the hilltops showed  white 
the sun came out , and he succeeded in locating the points  of the compass , though he knew now that he was lost  perhaps , in  his previous days  wanderings , he had edged away too far to the  left 
he now bore off to the right to counteract the possible  deviation from his true course 
though the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite , he realized  that he was weak 
he was compelled to pause for frequent rest ,  when he attacked the muskeg berries and rushgrass patches 
his  tongue felt dr and large , as though covered with a fine hairy  growth , and it tastd bitter in his mouth 
his heart gave him a  great deal of trouble 
when he had travelled a few minutes it  would begin a remorseless thump , thump , thump , and then leap up and  away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go  faint and dizzy 
in the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool 
it  was impossible to bale it , but he was calmer now and managed to  catch them in his tin bucket 
they were no longer than his little  finger , but he was not particularly hungry 
the dull ache in his  stmach had been growing duller and fainter 
it seemed almostthat  his stmach was dozing 
he ate the fish raw , mastcating with  painstking care , for the eating was an act of pure reason 
while  he had no desire to eat , he knew that he musteat to live 
in the evening he caught three more minnows , eating two and saving  the third for breakfast  the sun had dred stay shreds of moss ,  and he was able to warm himself with hot water 
he had not covered  more than ten miles that day 
the next day , travelling whenever  his heart permitted him , he covered no more than five miles 
his stmach did not give him the slightestuneasiness 
it had gone  to sleep 
he was in a stange country , too , and the caribou were  growing more plentiful , also the wolves 
often their yelps drfted  across the desolation , and once he saw three of them slinking away  before his path 
another night 
in the morning , being more rational , he untied  the leather sting that fastned the squat moosehide sack 
from  its open mouth poured a yellow steam of coarse golddustand  nuggets 
he roughly divided the gold in halves , caching one half  on a prominent ledge , wrapped in a piece of blanket , and returning  the other half to the sack 
he also began to use stips of the one  remaining blanket for his feet 
he stll clung to his gun , for  there were cartridges in that cache by the river dease 
this was a day of fog , and this day hunger awoke in him again 
he  was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times  blinded him 
it was no uncommon thing now for him to stmble and  fall 
stmbling once , he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest   there were four newly hatched chicks , a day old  little specks of  pulsating life no more than a mouthful 
he ate them ravenously ,  thrustng them alive into his mouth and crunching them like egg shells between his teeth 
the mother ptarmigan beat about him with  great outcry 
he used his gun as a club with which to knock her  over , but she dodged out of reach 
he threw stnes at her and with  one chance shot broke a wing 
she fluttered away , running ,  trailing the broken wing , with him in pursuit 
the little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite 
he hopped  and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle , throwing stnes and  screaming hoarsely at times 
at other times hopping and bobbing  silently along , picking himself up grimly and patiently when he  fell , or rubbing his eyes with his hand when the giddiness  threatened to overpower him 
the chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley ,  and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss 
they were not his  own  he could see that 
they mustbe bill s 
he could not  stp , for the mother ptarmigan was running on 
he would catch her  first then he would return and investgate 
he exhaustd the mother ptarmigan 
he exhaustd himself 
she  lay panting on her side 
he lay panting on his side , a dozen feet  away , unable to crawl to her 
as he recovered she recovered ,  fluttering out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her 
the  chase was resumed 
night settled down and she escaped 
he  stmbled from weakness and pitched head foremoston his face ,  cutting his cheek , his pack upon his back 
he did not move for a  long while 
he rolled over on his side , wound his watch , and  lay there until morning 
another day of fog 
half of his lastblanket had gone into foot wrappings 
he failed to pick up bill s trail 
it did not matter 
his hunger was drving him too compellingly  only  only he  wondered if bill , too , were lost  by midday the irk of his pack  became too oppressive 
again he divided the gold , this time merely  spilling half of it on the ground 
in the afternoon he threw the  restof it away , there remaining to him only the halfblanket , the  tin bucket , and the rifle 
an hallucination began to trouble him 
he felt confident that one  cartridge remained to him 
it was in the chamber of the rifle and  he had overlooked it 
on the other hand , he knew all the time that  the chamber was empty 
the hallucination persistd 
he fought  it off for hours , then threw his rifle open and was confronted with  emptiness 
the disappointment was as bitter as though he had  really expected to find the cartridge 
he plodded on for half an hour , when the hallucination arose again 
again he fought it , and stll it persistd , till for very relief he  opened his rifle to unconvince himself 
at times his mind wandered  farther afield , and he plodded on , a mere automaton , stange  conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his brain like worms 
these excursions out of the real were of brief duration , for ever  the pangs of the hungerbite called him back 
he was jerked back  abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight that caused him  nearly to faint 
he reeled and swayed , doddering like a drnken  man to keep from falling 
before him stod a horse 
a horse 
he  could not believe his eyes 
a thick mistwas in them , intershot  with sparkling points of light 
he rubbed his eyes savagely to  clear his vision , and beheld , not a horse , but a great brown bear 
the animal was stdying him with bellicose curiosity 
the man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he  realized 
he lowered it and drw his huntingknife from its beaded  sheath at his hip 
before him was meat and life 
he ran his thumb  along the edge of his knife 
it was sharp 
the point was sharp 
he would fling himself upon the bear and kill it 
his heart  began its warning thump , thump , thump 
followed the wild  upward leap and tattoo of flutters , the pressing as of an iron band  about his forehead , the creeping of the dizziness into his brain 
his desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear 
in his  weakness , what if the animal attacked him 
he drw himself up to  his mostimposing stture , gripping the knife and string hard at  the bear 
the bear advanced clumsily a couple of stps , reared up ,  and gave vent to a tentative growl 
if the man ran , he would run  after him 
the man did not run 
he was animated now with the  courage of fear 
he , too , growled , savagely , terribly , voicing the  fear that is to life germane and that lies twistd about life s  deepestroots 
the bear edged away to one side , growling menacingly , himself  appalled by this mystrious creature that appeared upright and  unafraid 
the man did not move 
he stod like a sttue till  the danger was past when he yielded to a fit of trembling and sank  down into the wet moss 
he pulled himself together and went on , afraid now in a new way 
it was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food ,  but that he should be destoyed violently before strvation had  exhaustd the lastparticle of the endeavor in him that made toward  surviving 
there were the wolves 
back and forth across the  desolation drfted their howls , weaving the very air into a fabric  of menace that was so tangible that he found himself , arms in the  air , pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a wind blown tent 
now and again the wolves , in packs of two and three , crossed his  path 
they sheered clear of him 
they were not in sufficient  numbers , and besides they were hunting the caribou , which did not  battle , while this stange creature that walked erect might scratch  and bite 
in the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves  had made a kill 
the debris had been a caribou calf an hour  before , squawking and running and very much alive 
he contemplated  the bones , cleanpicked and polished , pink with the celllife in  them which had not yet died 
could it possibly be that he might be  that ere the day was done 
such was life , eh 
a vain and fleeting  thing 
it was only life that pained 
there was no hurt in death 
to die was to sleep 
it meant cessation , rest  then why was he  not content to die 
he did not moralize long 
he was squatting in the moss , a bone  in his mouth , sucking at the shreds of life that stll dyed it  faintly pink 
the sweet meaty tast , thin and elusive almostas a  memory , maddened him 
he closed his jaws on the bones and  crunched 
metimes it was the bone that broke , sometimes his  teeth 
he crushed the bones between rocks , pounded them to a  pulp , and swallowed them 
he pounded his fingers , too , in his  hast , and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact  that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending  rock 
came frightful days of snow and rain 
he did not know when he made  camp , when he broke camp 
he travelled in the night as much as in  the day 
he restd wherever he fell , crawled on whenever the dying  life in him flickered up and burned less dimly 
he , as a man , no  longer stove 
it was the life in him , unwilling to die , that  drve him on 
he did not suffer 
his nerves had become blunted ,  numb , while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious  drams 
ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou  calf , the leastremnants of which he had gathered up and carried  with him 
he crossed no more hills or divides , but automatically  followed a large steam which flowed through a wide and shallow  valley 
he did not see this steam nor this valley 
he saw  nothing save visions 
ul and body walked or crawled side by  side , yet apart , so slender was the thread that bound them 
he awoke in his right mind , lying on his back on a rocky ledge 
the sun was shining bright and warm 
afar off he heard the  squawking of caribou calves 
he was aware of vague memories of  rain and wind and snow , but whether he had been beaten by the strm  for two days or two weeks he did not know 
for some time he lay without movement , the genial sunshine pouring  upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth 
a fine  day , he thought 
perhaps he could manage to locate himself 
by a  painful effort he rolled over on his side 
below him flowed a wide  and sluggish river 
its unfamiliarity puzzled him 
slowly he  followed it with his eyes , winding in wide sweeps among the bleak ,  bare hills , bleaker and barer and lowerlying than any hills he had  yet encountered 
slowly , deliberately , without excitement or more  than the mostcasual interest he followed the course of the  stange steam toward the skyline and saw it emptying into a  bright and shining sea 
he was stll unexcited 
mostunusual , he  thought , a vision or a mirage  more likely a vision , a trick of  his disordered mind 
he was confirmed in this by sight of a ship  lying at anchor in the midstof the shining sea 
he closed his  eyes for a while , then opened them 
stange how the vision  persistd 
yet not stange 
he knew there were no seas or ships  in the heart of the barren lands , justas he had known there was no  cartridge in the empty rifle 
he heard a snuffle behind him  a halfchoking gasp or cough 
very  slowly , because of his exceeding weakness and stffness , he rolled  over on his other side 
he could see nothing near at hand , but he  waited patiently 
again came the snuffle and cough , and outlined  between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the  gray head of a wolf 
the sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as  he had seen them on other wolves 
the eyes were bleared and  bloodshot , the head seemed to drop limply and forlornly 
the  animal blinked continually in the sunshine 
it seemed sick 
as he  looked it snuffled and coughed again 
this , at least was real , he thought , and turned on the other side  so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled  from him before by the vision 
the sea stll shone in the  distnce and the ship was plainly discernible 
was it reality ,  after all 
he closed his eyes for a long while and thought , and  then it came to him 
he had been making north by east away from  the dease divide and into the coppermine valley 
this wide and  sluggish river was the coppermine 
that shining sea was the arctic  ocean 
that ship was a whaler , stayed east far east from the  mouth of the mackenzie , and it was lying at anchor in coronation  gulf 
he remembered the hudson bay company chart he had seen long  ago , and it was all clear and reasonable to him 
he sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs 
he had  worn through the blanketwrappings , and his feet were shapeless  lumps of raw meat 
his lastblanket was gone 
rifle and knife  were both missing 
he had losthis hat somewhere , with the bunch  of matches in the band , but the matches againsthis chestwere safe  and dr inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper 
he looked at his  watch 
it marked eleven o clock and was stll running 
evidently  he had kept it wound 
he was calm and collected 
though extremely weak , he had no  sensation of pain 
he was not hungry 
the thought of food was not  even pleasant to him , and whatever he did was done by his reason  alone 
he ripped off his pants  legs to the knees and bound them  about his feet 
mehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin  bucket 
he would have some hot water before he began what he  foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship 
his movements were slow 
he shook as with a palsy 
when he  strted to collect dr moss , he found he could not rise to his  feet 
he tried again and again , then contented himself with  crawling about on hands and knees 
once he crawled near to the  sick wolf 
the animal drgged itself reluctantly out of his way ,  licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the  stength to curl 
the man noticed that the tongue was not the  custmary healthy red 
it was a yellowish brown and seemed coated  with a rough and halfdr mucus 
after he had drnk a quart of hot water the man found he was able  to stnd , and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed  to walk 
every minute or so he was compelled to rest  his stps  were feeble and uncertain , justas the wolf s that trailed him were  feeble and uncertain 
that night , when the shining sea was  blotted out by blackness , he knew he was nearer to it by no more  than four miles 
throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf , and now  and then the squawking of the caribou calves 
there was life all  around him , but it was stong life , very much alive and well , and  he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man s trail in the hope  that the man would die first  in the morning , on opening his eyes ,  he beheld it regarding him with a wistul and hungry stre 
it  stod crouched , with tail between its legs , like a miserable and  woebegone dog 
it shivered in the chill morning wind , and grinned  dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no  more than a hoarse whisper 
the sun rose brightly , and all morning the man tottered and fell  toward the ship on the shining sea 
the weather was perfect 
it  was the brief indian summer of the high latitudes 
it might lasta  week 
tomorrow or next day it might he gone 
in the afternoon the man came upon a trail 
it was of another man ,  who did not walk , but who drgged himself on all fours 
the man  thought it might be bill , but he thought in a dull , uninterestd  way 
he had no curiosity 
in fact , sensation and emotion had left  him 
he was no longer susceptible to pain 
stmach and nerves had  gone to sleep 
yet the life that was in him drve him on 
he was  very weary , but it refused to die 
it was because it refused to  die that he stll ate muskeg berries and minnows , drnk his hot  water , and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf 
he followed the trail of the other man who drgged himself along ,  and soon came to the end of it  a few freshpicked bones where the  soggy moss was marked by the footpads of many wolves 
he saw a  squat moosehide sack , mate to his own , which had been torn by  sharp teeth 
he picked it up , though its weight was almosttoo  much for his feeble fingers 
bill had carried it to the last  ha 
ha 
he would have the laugh on bill 
he would survive and carry  it to the ship in the shining sea 
his mirth was hoarse and  ghasty , like a raven s croak , and the sick wolf joined him ,  howling lugubriously 
the man ceased suddenly 
how could he have  the laugh on bill if that were bill 
if those bones , so pinkywhite  and clean , were bill 
he turned away 
well , bill had deserted him 
he would not take  the gold , nor would he suck bill s bones 
bill would have , though ,  had it been the other way around , he mused as he stggered on 
he came to a pool of water 
stoping over in questof minnows , he  jerked his head back as though he had been stng 
he had caught  sight of his reflected face 
horrible was it that sensibility  awoke long enough to be shocked 
there were three minnows in the  pool , which was too large to drin 
after several ineffectual  attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore 
he was  afraid , because of his great weakness , that he might fall in and  drwn 
it was for this reason that he did not trusthimself to the  river astide one of the many drftlogs which lined its sand spits 
that day he decreased the distnce between him and the ship by  three miles 
the next day by two  for he was crawling now as bill  had crawled 
the end of the fifth day found the ship stll  seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day 
stll  the indian summer held on , and he continued to crawl and faint ,  turn and turn about 
ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at  his heels 
his knees had become raw meat like his feet , and though  he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he  left behind him on the moss and stnes 
once , glancing back , he  saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail , and he saw  sharply what his own end might be  unless  unless he could get  the wolf 
began as grim a tragedy of existnce as was ever  played  a sick man that crawled , a sick wolf that limped , two  creatures drgging their dying carcasses across the desolation and  hunting each other s lives 
had it been a well wolf , it would not have mattered so much to the  man 
the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and  all but dead thing was repugnant to him 
he was finicky 
his mind  had begun to wander again , and to be perplexed by hallucinations ,  while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter 
he was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear 
the wolf leaped lamely back , losing its footing and falling in its  weakness 
it was ludicrous , but he was not amused 
nor was he  even afraid 
he was too far gone for that 
his mind was for  the moment clear , and he lay and considered 
the ship was no more  than four miles away 
he could see it quite distnctly when he  rubbed the mist out of his eyes , and he could see the white sail  of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea 
he could  never crawl those four miles 
he knew that , and was very calm in  the knowledge 
he knew that he could not crawl half a mile 
yet he wanted to live 
it was unreasonable that he should die  after all he had undergone 
fate asked too much of him 
dying , he declined to die 
it was strk madness , perhaps , but in  the very grip of death he defied death and refused to die 
he closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution 
he steled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that  lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being 
it  was very like a sea , this deadly languor , that rose and rose and  drwned his consciousness bit by bit 
metimes he was all but  submerged , swimming through oblivion with a faltering stoke 
again , by some stange alchemy of soul , he would find another shred  of will and stike out more stongly 
without movement he lay on his back , and he could hear , slowly  drwing near and nearer , the wheezing intake and output of the sick  wolf s breath 
it drw closer , ever closer , through an infinitude  of time , and he did not move 
it was at his ear 
the harsh dr  tongue grated like sandpaper againsthis cheek 
his hands shot out   or at leasthe willed them to shoot out 
the fingers were curved  like talons , but they closed on empty air 
swiftness and certitude  require stength , and the man had not this stength 
the patience of the wolf was terrible 
the man s patience was no  less terrible 
for half a day he lay motionless , fighting off  unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him  and upon which he wished to feed 
metimes the languid sea rose  over him and he dramed long drams 
ever through it all ,  waking and draming , he waited for the wheezing breath and the  harsh caress of the tongue 
he did not hear the breath , and he slipped slowly from some dram  to the feel of the tongue along his hand 
he waited 
the fangs  pressed softly 
the pressure increased 
the wolf was exerting its  laststength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it  had waited so long 
the man had waited long , and the lacerated  hand closed on the jaw 
slowly , while the wolf stuggled feebly  and the hand clutched feebly , the other hand crept across to a  grip 
five minutes later the whole weight of the man s body was on  top of the wolf 
the hands had not sufficient stength to choke  the wolf , but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat  of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair 
at the end  of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat 
it was not pleasant 
it was like molten lead being forced into his  stmach , and it was forced by his will alone 
later the man rolled  over on his back and slept 
there were some members of a scientific expedition on the whale ship bedford 
from the deck they remarked a stange object on the  shore 
it was moving down the beach toward the water 
they were  unable to classify it , and , being scientific men , they climbed into  the whaleboat alongside and went ashore to see 
they saw  something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man 
it was blind , unconscious 
it squirmed along the ground like some  monstous worm 
mostof its efforts were ineffectual , but it was  persistnt , and it writhed and twistd and went  ead perhaps a  score of feet an hour 
three weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whaleship  bedford , and with tears steaming down his wastd cheeks told who  he was and what he had undergone 
he also babbled incoherently of  his mother , of sunny southern california , and a home among the  orange groves and flowers 
the days were not many after that when he sat at table with the  scientific men and ship s officers 
he gloated over the spectacle  of so much food , watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths  of others 
with the disappearance of each mouthful an expression  of deep regret came into his eyes 
he was quite sane , yet he hated  those men at mealtime 
he was haunted by a fear that the food  would not last  he inquired of the cook , the cabinboy , the  captain , concerning the food stres 
they reassured him countless  times 
he could not believe them , and pried cunningly about the  lazarette to see with his own eyes 
it was noticed that the man was getting fat 
he grew stuter with  each day 
the scientific men shook their heads and theorized 
they limited the man at his meals , but stll his girth increased  and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt 
the sailors grinned 
they knew 
when the scientific men set a  watch on the man , they knew too 
they saw him slouch for ard after  breakfast and , like a mendicant , with outstetched palm , accosta  sailor 
the sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea  biscuit 
he clutched it avariciously , looked at it as a miser  looks at gold , and thrustit into his shirt bosom 
similar were  the donations from other grinning sailors 
the scientific men were discreet 
they let him alone 
they  privily examined his bunk 
it was lined with hardtack 
the  mattress was stffed with hardtack 
every nook and cranny was  filled with hardtack 
yet he was sane 
he was taking precautions  againstanother possible famine  that was all 
he would recover  from it , the scientific men said 
he did , ere the bedford s  anchor rumbled down in san francisco bay 
a day s lodging it was the goshdangdeststmpede i ever seen 
a thousand dog teams hittin  the ice 
you couldn t see  m fer smoke 
two white  men an  a swede froze to death that night , an  there was a dozen  bustd their lungs 
did not i see with my own eyes the bottom  of the waterhole 
it was yellow with gold like a mustrdplastr 
that s why i stked the yukon for a minin  claim 
that s what made  the stmpede 
an  then there was nothin  to it 
that s what i  said  nothin  to it 
an  i ain t got over guessin  yet 
narrative of shorty 
john messner clung with mittened hand to the bucking geepole and  held the sled in the trail 
with the other mittened hand he rubbed  his cheeks and nose 
he rubbed his cheeks and nose every little  while 
in point of fact , he rarely ceased from rubbing them , and  sometimes , as their numbness increased , he rubbed fiercely 
his  forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap , the flaps of  which went over his ears 
the restof his face was protected by a  thick beard , goldenbrown under its coating of frost behind him churned a heavily loaded yukon sled , and before him  toiled a sting of five dogs 
the rope by which they drgged the  sled rubbed againstthe side of messner s leg 
when the dogs swung  on a bend in the trail , he stpped over the rope 
there were many  bends , and he was compelled to stp over it often 
metimes he  tripped on the rope , or stmbled , and at all times he was awkward ,  betraying a weariness so great that the sled now and again ran upon  his heels 
when he came to a staight piece of trail , where the sled could get  along for a moment without guidance , he let go the geepole and  batted his right hand sharply upon the hard wood 
he found it  difficult to keep up the circulation in that hand 
while he  pounded the one hand , he never ceased from rubbing his nose and  cheeks with the other 
it s too cold to travel , anyway , he said 
he spoke aloud , after  the manner of men who are much by themselves 
only a fool would  travel at such a temperature 
if it isn t eighty below , it s  because it s seventynine 
he pulled out his watch , and after some fumbling got it back into  the breastpocket of his thick woollen jacket 
he surveyed  the heavens and ran his eye along the white skyline to the south 
twelve o clock , he mumbled , a clear sky , and no sun 
he plodded on silently for ten minutes , and then , as though there  had been no lapse in his speech , he added  and no ground covered , and it s too cold to travel 
suddenly he yelled whoa 
at the dogs , and stpped 
he seemed in  a wild panic over his right hand , and proceeded to hammer it  furiously againstthe geepole 
you  poor  devils 
he addrssed the dogs , which had drpped  down heavily on the ice to rest  his was a broken , jerky  utterance , caused by the violence with which he hammered his numb  hand upon the wood 
what have you done anyway that a twolegged  other animal should come along , break you to harness , curb all your  natural proclivities , and make slavebeast out of you 
he rubbed his nose , not reflectively , but savagely , in order to  drve the blood into it , and urged the dogs to their work again 
he travelled on the frozen surface of a great river 
behind him it  stetched away in a mighty curve of many miles , losing itself in a  fantastc jumble of mountains , snowcovered and silent 
ead of  him the river split into many channels to accommodate the freight  of islands it carried on its breast  these islands were silent and  white 
no animals nor humming insects broke the silence 
no birds  flew in the chill air 
there was no sound of man , no mark of the  handiwork of man 
the world slept , and it was like the sleep of  death 
john messner seemed succumbing to the apathy of it all 
the frost was benumbing his spirit 
he plodded on with bowed head ,  unobservant , mechanically rubbing nose and cheeks , and batting his  stering hand againstthe geepole in the staight trailstetches 
the dogs were observant , and suddenly they stpped , turning  their heads and looking back at their mastr out of eyes that were  wistul and questoning 
their eyelashes were frostd white , as  were their muzzles , and they had all the seeming of decrepit old  age , what of the frostime and exhauston 
the man was about to urge them on , when he checked himself , roused  up with an effort , and looked around 
the dogs had stpped beside  a waterhole , not a fissure , but a hole manmade , chopped  laboriously with an axe through three and a half feet of ice 
a  thick skin of new ice showed that it had not been used for some  time 
messner glanced about him 
the dogs were already pointing  the way , each wistul and hoary muzzle turned toward the dim snow path that left the main river trail and climbed the bank of the  island 
all right , you sorefooted brutes , he said 
i will investgate 
you are not a bit more anxious to quit than i am 
he climbed the bank and disappeared 
the dogs did not lie down ,  but on their feet eagerly waited his return 
he came back to them ,  took a haulingrope from the front of the sled , and put it around  his shoulders 
he gee would the dogs to the right and put them at  the bank on the run 
it was a stff pull , but their weariness fell  from them as they crouched low to the snow , whining with eagerness  and gladness as they stuggled upward to the lastounce of effort  in their bodies 
when a dog slipped or faltered , the one behind  nipped his hind quarters 
the man shouted encouragement and  threats , and threw all his weight on the haulingrope 
they cleared the bank with a rush , swung to the left , and dashed up  to a small log cabin 
it was a deserted cabin of a single room ,  eight feet by ten on the inside 
messner unharnessed the animals ,  unloaded his sled and took possession 
the lastchance wayfarer  had left a supply of firewood 
messner set up his light sheetiron  stve and strred a fire 
he put five suncured salmon into the  oven to thaw out for the dogs , and from the waterhole filled his  coffeepot and cookingpail 
while waiting for the water to boil , he held his face over the  stve 
the moistre from his breath had collected on his beard and  frozen into a great mass of ice , and this he proceeded to thaw out 
as it melted and drpped upon the stve it sizzled and rose about  him in stam 
he helped the process with his fingers , working  loose small icechunks that fell rattling to the floor 
a wild outcry from the dogs without did not take him from his task 
he heard the wolfish snarling and yelping of stange dogs and the  sound of voices 
a knock came on the door 
come in , messner called , in a voice muffled because at the  moment he was sucking loose a fragment of ice from its anchorage on  his upper lip 
the door opened , and , gazing out of his cloud of stam , he saw a  man and a woman pausing on the threshold 
come in , he said peremptorily , and shut the door 
peering through the stam , he could make out but little of their  personal appearance 
the nose and cheek stap worn by the woman  and the trailwrappings about her head allowed only a pair of black  eyes to be seen 
the man was darkeyed and smoothshaven all  except his mustche , which was so iced up as to hide his mouth 
we justwanted to know if there is any other cabin around here ,  he said , at the same time glancing over the unfurnished stte of  the room 
we thought this cabin was empty 
it isn t my cabin , messner answered 
i justfound it a few  minutes ago 
come right in and camp 
plenty of room , and you  won t need your stve 
there s room for all 
at the sound of his voice the woman peered at him with quick  curiousness 
get your things off , her companion said to her 
i will unhitch  and get the water so we can strt cooking 
messner took the thawed salmon outside and fed his dogs 
he had to  guard them againstthe second team of dogs , and when he had  re‰ntered the cabin the other man had unpacked the sled and fetched  water 
messner s pot was boiling 
he threw in the coffee , settled  it with half a cup of cold water , and took the pot from the stve 
he thawed some sourdough biscuits in the oven , at the same time  heating a pot of beans he had boiled the night before and that had  ridden frozen on the sled all morning 
removing his utensils from the stve , so as to give the newcomers a  chance to cook , he proceeded to take his meal from the top of his  grubbox , himself sitting on his bedrll 
between mouthfuls he  talked trail and dogs with the man , who , with head over the stve ,  was thawing the ice from his mustche 
there were two bunks in the  cabin , and into one of them , when he had cleared his lip , the  stanger tossed his bedrll 
we will sleep here , he said , unless you prefer this bunk 
you are  the firstcomer and you have firstchoice , you know 
that s all right , messner answered 
one bunk s justas good as  the other 
he spread his own bedding in the second bunk , and sat down on the  edge 
the stanger thrusta physician s small travelling case  under his blankets at one end to serve for a pillow 
doctor 
messner asked 
yes , came the answer , but i assure you i did not come into the  klondike to practise 
the woman busied herself with cooking , while the man sliced bacon  and fired the stve 
the light in the cabin was dim , filtering  through in a small window made of onionskin writing paper and  oiled with bacon grease , so that john messner could not make out  very well what the woman looked like 
not that he tried 
he  seemed to have no interestin her 
she glanced curiously from  time to time into the dark corner where he sat 
oh , it s a great life , the doctor proclaimed enthusiastcally ,  pausing from sharpening his knife on the stvepipe 
what i like  about it is the stuggle , the endeavor with one s own hands , the  primitiveness of it , the realness 
the temperature is real enough , messner laughed 
do you know how cold it actually is 
the doctor demanded 
the other shook his head 
well , i will tell you 
seventyfour below zero by spirit  thermometer on the sled 
that s one hundrd and six below freezing point  too cold for  travelling , eh 
practically suicide , was the doctor s verdict 
one exerts  himself 
he breathes heavily , taking into his lungs the frost itself 
it chills his lungs , freezes the edges of the tissues 
he  gets a dr , hacking cough as the dead tissue sloughs away , and dies  the following summer of pneumonia , wondering what it s all about 
i will sty in this cabin for a week , unless the thermometer rises at  leastto fifty below 
i say , tess , he said , the next moment , do not you think that  coffee s boiled long enough 
at the sound of the woman s name , john messner became suddenly  alert 
he looked at her quickly , while across his face shot a  haunting expression , the ghostof some buried misery achieving  swift resurrection 
the next moment , and by an effort of will ,  the ghostwas laid again 
his face was as placid as before , though  he was stll alert , dissatisfied with what the feeble light had  shown him of the woman s face 
automatically , her firstact had been to set the coffeepot back 
it was not until she had done this that she glanced at messner 
already he had composed himself 
she saw only a man sitting on  the edge of the bunk and incuriously stdying the toes of his  moccasins 
as she turned casually to go about her cooking , he  shot another swift look at her , and she , glancing as swiftly back ,  caught his look 
he shifted on pasther to the doctor , though the  slightestsmile curled his lip in appreciation of the way she had  trapped him 
she drw a candle from the grubbox and lighted it 
one look at  her illuminated face was enough for messner 
in the small cabin  the widestlimit was only a matter of several stps , and the next  moment she was alongside of him 
she deliberately held the candle  close to his face and stred at him out of eyes wide with fear and  recognition 
he smiled quietly back at her 
what are you looking for , tess 
the doctor called 
hairpins , she replied , passing on and rummaging in a clothesbag  on the bunk 
they served their meal on their grubbox , sitting on messner s  grubbox and facing him 
he had stetched out on his bunk to rest  lying on his side , his head on his arm 
in the close quarters it  was as though the three were together at table 
what part of the sttes do you come from 
messner asked 
san francisco , answered the doctor 
i have been in here two  years , though 
i hail from california myself , was messner s announcement 
the woman looked at him appealingly , but he smiled and went on  berkeley , you know 
the other man was becoming interestd 
u 
c 

he asked 
yes , class of  86 
i meant faculty , the doctor explained 
you remind me of the  type 
rry to hear you say so , messner smiled back 
i would prefer being  taken for a prospector or a dogmusher 
i do not think he looks any more like a professor than you do a  doctor , the woman broke in 
thank you , said messner 
turning to her companion , by the  way , doctor , what is your name , if i may ask 
haythorne , if you will take my word for it 
i gave up cards with  civilization 
mr 
haythorne , messner smiled and bowed 
she flashed a look at him that was more anger than appeal 
haythorne was about to ask the other s name 
his mouth had opened  to form the queston when messner cut him off 
come to think of it , doctor , you may possibly be able to satisfy  my curiosity 
there was a sort of scandal in faculty circles some  two or three years ago 
the wife of one of the english professors   er , if you will pardon me , mr 
haythorne  disappeared with some  san francisco doctor , i understod , though his name does not just now come to my lips 
do you remember the incident 
haythorne nodded his head 
made quite a str at the time 
his  name was womble  gr am womble 
he had a magnificent practice 
i  knew him somewhat 
well , what i was trying to get at was what had become of them 
i  was wondering if you had heard 
they left no trace , hide nor  hair 
he covered his tracks cunningly 
haythorne cleared his throat 
there was rumor that they went to the south seas  were loston a  trading schooner in a typhoon , or something like that 
i never heard that , messner said 
you remember the case , mr 
haythorne 
perfectly , she answered , in a voice the control of which was in  amazing contrastto the anger that blazed in the face she turned  aside so that haythorne might not see 
the latter was again on the verge of asking his name , when messner  remarked  this dr womble , i have heard he was very handsome , and  er  quite  a success , so to say , with the ladies 
well , if he was , he finished himself off by that affair ,  haythorne grumbled 
the woman was a termagant  at leastso i have been told 
it  was generally accepted in berkeley that she made life  er  not  exactly paradise for her husband 
i never heard that , haythorne rejoined 
in san francisco the  talk was all the other way 
woman sort of a martyr , eh 
crucified on the cross of  matrimony 
the doctor nodded 
messner s gray eyes were mildly curious as he  went on  that was to be expected  two sides to the shield 
living in  berkeley i only got the one side 
she was a great deal in san  francisco , it seems 
me coffee , please , haythorne said 
the woman refilled his mug , at the same time breaking into light  laughter 
you are gossiping like a pair of beldames , she chided them 
it s so interestng , messner smiled at her , then returned to the  doctor 
the husband seems then to have had a not very savory  reputation in san francisco 
on the contrary , he was a moral prig , haythorne blurted out , with  apparently undue warmth 
he was a little scholastc shrimp  without a drp of red blood in his body 
did you know him 
never laid eyes on him 
i never knocked about in university  circles 
one side of the shield again , messner said , with an air of  weighing the matter judicially 
while he did not amount to much ,  it is true  that is , physically  i would hardly say he was as bad as  all that 
he did take an active interestin stdent athletics 
he had some talent 
he once wrote a nativity play that brought  him quite a bit of local appreciation 
i have heard , also , that he  was slated for the head of the english department , only the affair  happened and he resigned and went away 
it quite broke his career ,  or so it seemed 
at any rate , on our side the shield , it was  considered a knockout blow to him 
it was thought he cared a  great deal for his wife 
haythorne , finishing his mug of coffee , grunted uninterestdly and  lighted his pipe 
it was fortunate they had no childrn , messner continued 
haythorne , with a glance at the stve , pulled on his cap and  mittens 
i am going out to get some wood , he said 
i can take off my  moccasins and he comfortable 
the door slammed behind him 
for a long minute there was silence 
the man continued in the same position on the bed 
the woman sat  on the grubbox , facing him 
what are you going to do 
she asked abruptly 
messner looked at her with lazy indecision 
what do you think i  ought to do 
nothing scenic , i hope 
you see i am stff and  trailsore , and this bunk is so restul 
she gnawed her lower lip and fumed dumbly 
she began vehemently , then clenched her hands and stpped 
i hope you do not want me to kill mr er  haythorne , he said  gently , almostpleadingly 
it would be mostdistessing , and , i  assure you , really it is unnecessary 
you mustdo something , she cried 
on the contrary , it is quite conceivable that i do not have to do  anything 
you would sty here 
he nodded 
she glanced desperately around the cabin and at the bed unrolled on  the other bunk 
night is coming on 
you can t stp here 
you  can t 
i tell you , you simply can t 
of course i can 
i might remind you that i found this cabin first and that you are my guest 
again her eyes travelled around the room , and the terror in them  leaped up at sight of the other bunk 
we will have to go , she announced decisively 
impossible 
you have a dr , hacking cough  the sort mr  er   haythorne so aptly described 
you have already slightly chilled your  lungs 
besides , he is a physician and knows 
he would never  permit it 
what are you going to do 
she demanded again , with a tense ,  quiet utterance that boded an outbreak 
messner regarded her in a way that was almostpaternal , what of the  profundity of pity and patience with which he contrived to suffuse  it 
my dear theresa , as i told you before , i do not know 
i really  haven t thought about it 
oh 
you drve me mad 
she sprang to her feet , wringing her  hands in impotent wrath 
you never used to be this way 
i used to be all softness and gentleness , he nodded concurrence 
was that why you left me 
you are so different , so dradfully calm 
you frighten me 
i  feel you have something terrible planned all the while 
whatever you do , do not do anything rash 
do not get excited   i do not get excited any more , he interrupted 
not since you  went away 
you have improved  remarkably , she retorted 
he smiled acknowledgment 
while i am thinking about what i shall  do , i will tell you what you will have to do  tell mr  er   haythorne who i am 
it may make our sty in this cabin more  may  i say , sociable 
why have you followed me into this frightful country 
she asked  irrelevantly 
do not think i came here looking for you , theresa 
your vanity  shall not be tickled by any such misapprehension 
our meeting is  wholly fortuitous 
i broke with the life academic and i had to go  somewhere 
to be honest i came into the klondike because i  thought it the place you were leastliable to be in 
there was a fumbling at the latch , then the door swung in and  haythorne entered with an armful of firewood 
at the first warning , theresa began casually to clear away the dishes 
haythorne went out again after more wood 
why did not you introduce us 
messner queried 
i will tell him , she replied , with a toss of her head 
do not  think i am afraid 
i never knew you to be afraid , very much , of anything 
i am not afraid of confession , either , she said , with  softening face and voice 
in your case , i fear , confession is exploitation by indirection ,  profitmaking by ruse , selfaggrandizement at the expense of god 
do not be literary , she pouted , with growing tenderness 
i never  did like epigrammatic discussion 
besides , i am not afraid to ask  you to forgive me 
there is nothing to forgive , theresa 
i really should thank you 
true , at firsti suffered 
then , with all the graciousness of  spring , it dawned upon me that i was happy , very happy 
it was a  mostamazing discovery 
what if i should return to you 
she asked 
i should  between him and his prospects 
you think so , mrheadstne 
conscious that his pupilteacher was looking for his answer , that he himself had suggestd the boy s keeping aloof from this sistr , now seen for the firsttime face to face , bradley headstne stmmered   your brother is very much occupied , you know 
he has to work hard 
one cannot but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work , the better for his future 
when he shall have estblished himself , why thenit will be another thing then 
lizzie shook her head again , and returned , with a quiet smile   i always advised him as you advise him 
did i not , charley 
well , never mind that now ,  said the boy 
how are you getting on 
havery well , charley 
i want for nothing 
you have your own room here 
oh yes 
upstirs 
it s quiet , and pleasant , and airy 
she always has the use of this room for visitors ,  said the person of the house , screwing up one of her little bony fist , like an operaglass , and looking through it , with her eyes and her chin in that quaint accordance 
always this room for visitors 
haven t you , lizzie dear 
it happened that bradley headstne noticed a very slight action of lizzie hexam s hand , as though it checked the doll s drssmaker 
it happened that the latter noticed him in the same instnt 
for she made a double eyeglass of her two hands , looked at him through it , and cried , with a waggish shake of her head    a 
caught you spying , did i 
it might have fallen out so , any way 
bradley headstne also noticed that immediately after this , lizzie , who had not taken off her bonnet , rather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should go out into the air 
they went out 
the visitors saying goodnight to the doll s drssmaker , whom they left , leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed , singing to herself in a sweet thoughtful little voice 
i will saunter on by the river ,  said bradley 
you will be glad to talk together 
as his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows , the boy said to his sistr , petulantly   when are you going to settle yourself in some christan sort of place , liz 
i thought you were going to do it before now 
i am very well where i am , charley 
havery well where you are 
i am ashamed to have brought mrheadstne with me 
how came you to get into such company as that little witch s 
by chance at first as it seemed , charley 
i think it musthave been by something more than chance , for that childyou remember the bills upon the walls at home 
confound the bills upon the walls at home 
i want to forget the bills upon the walls at home , and it would be better for you to do the same ,  grumbled the boy 
well 
what of them 
this child is the grandchild of the old man 
what old man 
the terrible drnken old man , in the listslippers and the night cap 
the boy asked , rubbing his nose in a manner that half expressed vexation at hearing so much , and half curiosity to hear more   how came you to make that out 
what a girl you are 
the child s father is employed by the house that employs me 
that s how i came to know it , charley 
the father is like his own father , a weak wretched trembling creature , falling to pieces , never sober 
a good workman too , at the work he does 
the mother is dead 
this poor ailing little creature has come to be what she is , surrounded by drnken people from her cradleif she ever had one , charley 
i do not see what you have to do with her , for all that ,  said the boy 
wouldo not you , charley 
the boy looked doggedly at the river 
they were at millbank , and the river rolled on their left 
his sistr gently touched him on the shoulder , and pointed to it 
any compensationresttutionnever mind the word , you know my meaning 
father s grave 
he did not respond with any tenderness 
after a moody silence he broke out in an illused tone   it will be a very hard thing , liz , if , when i am trying my bestto get up in the world , you pull me back 
i , charley 
yes , you , liz 
why can t you let bygones be bygones 
why can t you , as mrheadstne said to me this very evening about another matter , leave well alone 
what we have got to do , is , to turn our faces full in our new direction , and keep staight on 
never look back 
not even to try to make some amends 
you are such a dramer ,  said the boy , with his former petulance 
it was all very well when we sat before the firewhen we looked into the hollow down by the flarebut we are looking into the real world , now 
 , we were looking into the real world then , charley 
i understnd what you mean by that , but you are not justfied in it 
i do not want , as i raise myself to shake you off , liz 
i want to carry you up with me 
that s what i want to do , and mean to do 
i know what i owe you 
i said to mrheadstne this very evening , after all , my sistr got me here 
well , then 
do not pull me back , and hold me down 
that s all i ask , and surely that s not unconscionable 
she had kept a stadfastlook upon him , and she answered with composure   i am not here selfishly , charley 
to please myself i could not be too far from that river 
nor could you be too far from it to please me 
let us get quit of it equally 
why should you linger about it any more than i 
i give it a wide berth 
i can t get away from it , i think ,  said lizzie , passing her hand across her forehead 
it s no purpose of mine that i live by it stll 
there you go , liz 
draming again 
you lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drnkentailor , i supposeor something of the sort , and a little crooked antic of a child , or old person , or whatever it is , and then you talk as if you were drwn or drven there 
now , do be more practical 
she had been practical enough with him , in suffering and stiving for him 
she only laid her hand upon his shouldernot reproachfullyand tapped it twice or thrice 
she had been used to do so , to soothe him when she carried him about , a child as heavy as herself 
tears strted to his eyes 
upon my word , liz ,  drwing the back of his hand across them ,  i mean to be a good brother to you , and to prove that i know what i owe you 
all i say is , that i hope you will control your fancies a little , on my account 
i will get a school , and then you mustcome and live with me , and you will have to control your fancies then , so why not now 
now , say i haven t vexed you 
you haven t , charley , you haven t 
say i haven t hurt you 
you haven t , charley 
this answer was less ready 
say you are sure i did not mean to 
come 
there s mrheadstne stpping and looking over the wall at the tide , to hint that it s time to go 
kiss me , and tell me that you know i did not mean to hurt you 
she told him so , and they embraced , and walked on and came up with the schoolmastr 
we go your sistr s way ,  he remarked , when the boy told him he was ready 
with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stffly offered her his arm 
her hand was justwithin it , when she drw it back 
he looked round with a strt , as if he thought she had detected something that repelled her , in the momentary touch 
i will not go in justyet ,  said lizzie 
you have a distnce before you , and will walk fastr without me 
being by this time close to vauxhall bridge , they resolved , in consequence , to take that way over the thames , and they left her 
bradley headstne giving her his hand at parting , and she thanking him for his care of her brother 
the mastr and the pupil walked on , rapidly and silently 
they had nearly crossed the bridge , when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them , with a cigar in his mouth , his coat thrown back , and his hands behind him 
mething in the careless manner of this person , and in a certain lazily arrogant air with which he approached , holding possession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed , instntly caught the boy s attention 
as the gentleman passed the boy looked at him narrowly , and then stod stll , looking after him 
who is it that you stre after 
asked bradley 
why 
bradley headstne scrutinized the boy as closely as the boy had scrutinized the gentleman 
i beg your pardon , mrheadstne , but i couldn t help wondering what in the world brought him here 
though he said it as if his wonder were pastt the same time resuming the walkit was not lostupon the mastr that he looked over his shoulder after speaking , and that the same perplexed and pondering frown was heavy on his face 
you do not appear to like your friend , hexam 
i do not like him ,  said the boy 
why not 
he took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way , the firsttime i ever saw him ,  said the boy 
again , why 
for nothing 
orit s much the samebecause something i happened to say about my sistr did not happen to please him 
he knows your sistr 
he did not at that time ,  said the boy , stll moodily pondering 
wouldoes now 
the boy had so losthimself that he looked at mrbradley headstne as they walked on side by side , without attempting to reply until the queston had been repeated 
he nodded and answered ,  yes , sir 
going to see her , i dare say 
it can t be 
he doesn t know her well enough 
i should like to catch him at it 
when they had walked on for a time , more rapidly than before , the mastr said , clasping the pupil s arm between the elbow and the shoulder with his hand   you were going to tell me something about that person 
what did you say his name was 
wrayburn 
mreugene wrayburn 
he is what they call a barristr , with nothing to do 
the firsttime be came to our old place was when my father was alive 
he came on business 
not that it was his businesshe never had any businesshe was brought by a friend of his 
the other times 
there was only one other time that i know of 
when my father was killed by accident , he chanced to be one of the finders 
he was mooning about , i suppose , taking liberties with people s chins 
there he was , somehow 
he brought the news home to my sistr early in the morning , and brought miss abbey potterson , a neighbour , to help break it to her 
he was mooning about the house when i was fetched home in the afternoonthey did not know where to find me till my sistr could be brought round sufficiently to tell themand then he mooned away 
is that all 
that s all , sir 
bradley headstne gradually released the boy s arm , as if he were thoughtful , and they walked on side by side as before 
after a long silence between them , bradley resumed the talk 
i supposeyour sistr  with a curious break both before and after the words ,  has received hardly any teaching , hexam 
hardly any , sir 
sacrificed , no doubt , to her father s objections 
i remember them in your case 
yetyour sistrscarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant person 
lizzie has as much thought as the best mrheadstne 
too much , perhaps , without teaching 
i used to call the fire at home , her books , for she was always full of fanciessometimes quite wise fancies , consideringwhen she sat looking at it 
i do not like that ,  said bradley headstne 
his pupil was a little surprised by this stiking in with so sudden and decided and emotional an objection , but took it as a proof of the mastr s interestin himself 
it emboldened him to say   i have never brought myself to mention it openly to you , mrheadstne , and you are my witness that i couldn t even make up my mind to take it from you before we came out tonight 
it s a painful thing to think that if i get on as well as you hope , i shall bei won t say disgraced , because i do not mean disgraced—but rather put to the blush if it was knownby a sistr who has been very good to me 
yes ,  said bradley headstne in a slurring way , for his mind scarcely seemed to touch that point , so smoothly did it glide to another ,  and there is this possibility to consider 
me man who had worked his way might come to admireyour sistrand might even in time bring himself to think of marryingyour sistrand it would be a sad drwback and a heavy penalty upon him , if 
overcoming in his mind other inequalities of condition and other considerations againstit , this inequality and this consideration remained in full force 
that s much my own meaning , sir 
ay , ay ,  said bradley headstne ,  but you spoke of a mere brother 
now , the case i have supposed would be a much stonger case 
because an admirer , a husband , would form the connexion voluntarily , besides being obliged to proclaim it  which a brother is not 
after all , you know , it mustbe said of you that you couldn t help yourself  while it would be said of him , with equal reason , that he could 
that s true , sir 
metimes since lizzie was left free by father s death , i have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more than enough to pass mustr 
sometimes i have even thought that perhaps miss peecher   for the purpose , i would advise not miss peecher ,  bradley headstne stuck in with a recurrence of his late decision of manner 
would you be so kind as to think of it for me , mrheadstne 
yes , hexam , yes 
i will think of it 
i will think maturely of it 
i will think well of it 
their walk was almosta silent one afterwards , until it ended at the schoolhouse 
there , one of neat miss peecher s little windows , like the eyes in needles , was illuminated , and in a corner near it sat mary anne watching , while miss peecher at the table sttched at the neat little body she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing 
n 
b 
miss peecher and miss peecher s pupils were not much encouraged in the unscholastc art of needlework , by government 
mary anne with her face to the window , held her arm up 
well , mary anne 
mrheadstne coming home , ma am 
in about a minute , mary anne again hailed 
yes , mary anne 
gone in and locked his door , ma am 
miss peecher repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed , and transfixed that part of her drss where her heart would have been if she had had the drss on , with a sharp , sharp needle 
chapter 2 stll educational the person of the house , doll s drssmaker and manufacturer of ornamental pincushions and penwipers , sat in her quaint little low armchair , singing in the dark , until lizzie came back 
the person of the house had attained that dignity while yet of very tender years indeed , through being the only trustorthy person in the house 
well lizziemizziewizzie ,  said she , breaking off in her song 
what s the news out of doors 
what s the news in doors 
returned lizzie , playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll s drssmaker 
let me see , said the blind man 
why the lastnews is , that i do not mean to marry your brother 
no 
noo ,  shaking her head and her chin 
wouldo not like the boy 
what do you say to his mastr 
i say that i think he is bespoke 
lizzie finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders , and then lighted a candle 
it showed the little parlour to be dingy , but orderly and clean 
she stod it on the mantelshelf , remote from the drssmaker s eyes , and then put the room door open , and the house door open , and turned the little low chair and its occupant towards the outer air 
it was a sultry night , and this was a fineweather arrangement when the day s work was done 
to complete it , she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair , and protectingly drw under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her 
this is what your loving jenny wren calls the besttime in the day and night ,  said the person of the house 
her real name was fanny cleaver 
she had long ago chosen to bestw upon herself the appellation of miss jenny wren 
i have been thinking ,  jenny went on ,  as i sat at work today , what a thing it would be , if i should be able to have your company till i am married , or at leastcourted 
because when i am courted , i shall make him do some of the things that you do for me 
he couldn t brush my hair like you do , or help me up and down stirs like you do , and he couldn t do anything like you do 
he could take my work home , and he could call for orders in his clumsy way 
he shall too 
i will trot him about , i can tell him 
jenny wren had her personal vanitieshappily for herand no intentions were stonger in her breastthan the various trials and torments that were , in the fulness of time , to be inflicted upon  him 
wherever he may happen to be justat present , or whoever he may happen to be ,  said miss wren ,  i know his tricks and his manners , and i give him warning to look out 
wouldo not you think you are rather hard upon him 
asked her friend , smiling , and smoothing her hair 
not a bit ,  replied the sage miss wren , with an air of vastexperience 
my dear , they do not care for you , those fellows , if you are not hard upon  em 
i was saying if i should be able to have your company 

what a large if 
ain t it 
i have no intention of parting company , jenny 
wouldo not say that , or you will go directly 
am i so little to be relied upon 
you are more to be relied upon than silver and gold 
as she said it , miss wren suddenly broke off , screwed up her eyes and her chin , and looked prodigiously knowing 
a 
who comes here 
a grenadier 
what does he want 
a pot of beer 
nothing else in the world , my dear 
a man s figure paused on the pavement at the outer door 
mreugene wrayburn , ain t it 
i am told ,  was the answer 
you may come in , if you are good 
i am not good ,  said eugene ,  but i will come in 
he gave his hand to jenny wren , and he gave his hand to lizzie , and he stod leaning by the door at lizzie s side 
he had been stolling with his cigar , he said ,  
j ai ici , avec moi , les filles du commandant de la fortification 
a 
tu en as entendu parler 
je les ai fait prisonnieres pres de l autre fort , et je les conduis au general 
ma foi 
mesdames 
j en suis fƒche pour vous , exclaimed the young soldier , touching his cap with grace 
maisfortune de guerre 
vous trouverez notre general un brave homme , et bien poli avec les dames 
c estle caractere des gens de guerre , said cora , with admirable selfpossession 
adieu , mon ami 
je vous souhaiterais un devoir plus agreable a remplir 
the soldier made a low and humble acknowledgment for her civility 
heyward adding a bonne nuit , mon camarade , they moved deliberately forward , leaving the sentinel pacing the banks of the silent pond , little suspecting an enemy of so much effrontery , and humming to himself those words which were recalled to his mind by the sight of women , and , perhaps , by recollections of his own distnt and beautiful france  vive le vin , vive l amour , etc 
 , etc 
tis well you understod the knave 
whispered the scout , when they had gained a little distnce from the place , and letting his rifle fall into the hollow of his arm again 
i soon saw that he was one of them uneasy frenchers 
well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his wishes kind , or a place might have been found for his bones among those of his countrymen 
he was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little basin , as though , in truth , the spirits of the departed lingered about their watery sepulcher 
surely it was of flesh , continued the scout 
no spirit could handle its arms so stadily 
it was of flesh 
whether the poor fellow stll belongs to this world may well be doubted , said heyward , glancing his eyes around him , and missing chingachgook from their little band 
another groan more faint than the former was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into the water , and all was stll again as if the borders of the drary pool had never been awakened from the silence of creation 
while they yet hesitated in uncertainty , the form of the indian was seen gliding out of the thicket 
as the chief rejoined them , with one hand he attached the reeking scalp of the unfortunate young frenchman to his girdle , and with the other he replaced the knife and tom awk that had drnk his blood 
he then took his wonted sttion , with the air of a man who believed he had done a deed of merit 
the scout drpped one end of his rifle to the earth , and leaning his hands on the other , he stod musing in profound silence 
shaking his head in a mournful manner , he muttered   twould have been a cruel and an unhuman act for a white skin 
tis the gift and natur  of an indian , and i suppose it should not be denied 
i could wish , though it had befallen an accursed mingo , rather than that gay young boy from the old countries 
enough 
tis done 
though better it were left undone , cannot be amended 
you see , we are , too obviously within the sentinels of the enemy 
what course do you propose to follow 
yes , said hawkeye , rousing himself again 
tis as you say , too late to harbor further thoughts about it 
ay , the french have gathered around the fort in good earnestand we have a delicate needle to thread in passing them 
but little time to do it in , added heyward , glancing his eyes upwards , toward the bank of vapor that concealed the setting moon 
little time to do it in 
repeated the scout 
the thing may be done in two fashions , by the help of providence , without which it may not be done at all 
name them quickly for time presses 
one would be to dismount the gentle ones , and let their beast range the plain , by sending the mohicans in front , we might then cut a lane through their sentries , and enter the fort over the dead bodies 
it will not doit will not do 
interrupted the generous heyward 
a soldier might force his way in this manner , but never with such a convoy 
twould be , indeed , a bloody path for such tender feet to wade in , returned the equally reluctant scout 
i thought it befitting my manhood to name it 
we must then , turn in our trail and get without the line of their lookouts , when we will bend short to the west and enter the mountains 
where i can hide you , so that all the devil s hounds in montcalm s pay would be thrown off the scent for months to come 
let it be done , and that instntly 
further words were unnecessary 
for hawkeye , merely uttering the mandate to follow , moved along the route by which they had justentered their present critical and even dangerous situation 
their progress , like their late dialogue , was guarded , and without noise 
for none knew at what moment a passing patrol , or a crouching picket of the enemy , might rise upon their path 
as they held their silent way along the margin of the pond , again heyward and the scout stle furtive glances at its appalling drariness 
they looked in vain for the form they had so recently seen stlking along in silent shores , while a low and regular wash of the little waves , by announcing that the waters were not yet subsided , furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they had justwitnessed 
like all that passing and gloomy scene , the low basin , however , quickly melted in the darkness , and became blended with the mass of black objects in the rear of the travelers 
hawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat , and stiking off towards the mountains which form the westrn boundary of the narrow plain , he led his followers , with swift stps , deep within the shadows that were castfrom their high and broken summits 
the route was now painful 
lying over ground ragged with rocks , and intersected with ravines , and their progress proportionately slow 
bleak and black hills lay on every side of them , compensating in some degree for the additional toil of the march by the sense of security they imparted 
at length the party began slowly to rise a step and rugged ascent , by a path that curiously wound among rocks and trees , avoiding the one and supported by the other , in a manner that showed it had been devised by men long practised in the arts of the wilderness 
as they gradually rose from the level of the valleys , the thick darkness which usually precedes the approach of day began to disperse , and objects were seen in the plain and palpable colors with which they had been gifted by nature 
when they issued from the stnted woods which clung to the barren sides of the mountain , upon a flat and mossy rock that formed its summit , they met the morning , as it came blushing above the green pines of a hill that lay on the opposite side of the valley of the horican 
the scout now told the sistrs to dismount 
taking the bridles from the mouths , and the saddles off the backs of the jaded beast , he turned them loose , to glean a scanty subsistnce among the shrubs and meager herbage of that elevated region 
go , he said , and seek your food where natur  gives it to you 
beware that you become not food to ravenous wolves yourselves , among these hills 
have we no further need of them 
demanded heyward 
see , and judge with your own eyes , said the scout , advancing toward the eastrn brow of the mountain , whither he beckoned for the whole party to follow 
if it was as easy to look into the heart of man as it is to spy out the nakedness of montcalm s camp from this spot , hypocrites would grow scarce , and the cunning of a mingo might prove a losing game , compared to the honest of a delaware 
when the travelers reached the verge of the precipices they saw , at a glance , the truth of the scout s declaration , and the admirable foresight with which he had led them to their commanding sttion 
the mountain on which they stod , elevated perhaps a thousand feet in the air , was a high cone that rose a little in advance of that range which stetches for miles along the westrn shores of the lake , until meeting its sistrs miles beyond the water , it ran off toward the canadas , in confused and broken masses of rock , thinly sprinkled with evergreens 
immediately at the feet of the party , the southern shore of the horican swept in a broad semicircle from mountain to mountain , marking a wide stand , that soon rose into an uneven and somewhat elevated plain 
to the north stetched the limpid , and , as it appeared from that dizzy height , the narrow sheet of the holy lake , indented with numberless bays , embellished by fantastc headlands , and dotted with countless islands 
at the distnce of a few leagues , the bed of the water became lostamong mountains , or was wrapped in the masses of vapor that came slowly rolling along their bosom , before a light morning air 
a narrow opening between the crest of the hills pointed out the passage by which they found their way stll further north , to spread their pure and ample sheets again , before pouring out their tribute into the distnt champlain 
to the shout stetched the defile , or rather broken plain , so often mentioned 
for several miles in this direction , the mountains appeared reluctant to yield their dominion , but within reach of the eye they diverged , and finally melted into the level and sandy lands , across which we have accompanied our adventurers in their double journey 
along both ranges of hills , which bounded the opposite sides of the lake and valley , clouds of light vapor were rising in spiral wreaths from the uninhabited woods , looking like the smoke of hidden cottages 
or rolled lazily down the declivities , to mingle with the fogs of the lower land 
a single , solitary , snow white cloud floated above the valley , and marked the spot beneath which lay the silent pool of the bloody pond 
directly on the shore of the lake , and nearer to its westrn than to its eastrn margin , lay the extensive earthen ramparts and low buildings of william henry 
two of the sweeping bastons appeared to reston the water which washed their bases , while a deep ditch and extensive morasses guarded its other sides and angles 
the land had been cleared of wood for a reasonable distnce around the work , but every other part of the scene lay in the green livery of nature , except where the limpid water mellowed the view , or the bold rocks thrusttheir black and naked heads above the undulating outline of the mountain ranges 
in its front might be seen the scattered sentinels , who held a weary watch againsttheir numerous foes 
within the walls themselves , the travelers looked down upon men stll drwsy with a night of vigilance 
toward the southeast but in immediate contact with the fort , was an entrenched camp , postd on a rocky eminence , that would have been far more eligible for the work itself , in which hawkeye pointed out the presence of those auxiliary regiments that had so recently left the hudson in their company 
from the woods , a little further to the south , rose numerous dark and lurid smokes , that were easily to be distnguished from the purer exhalations of the springs , and which the scout also showed to heyward , as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction 
the spectacle which mostconcerned the young soldier was on the westrn bank of the lake , though quite near to its southern termination 
on a stip of land , which appeared from his stnd too narrow to contain such an army , but which , in truth , extended many hundrds of yards from the shores of the horican to the base of the mountain , were to be seen the white tents and military engines of an encampment of ten thousand men 
batteries were already thrown up in their front , and even while the spectators above them were looking down , with such different emotions , on a scene which lay like a map beneath their feet , the roar of artillery rose from the valley , and passed off in thundering echoes along the eastrn hills 
morning is justtouching them below , said the deliberate and musing scout , and the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by the sound of cannon 
we are a few hours too late 
montcalm has already filled the woods with his accursed iroquois 
the place is , indeed , investd , returned duncan 
is there no expedient by which we may enter 
capture in the works would be far preferable to falling again into the hands of roving indians 
see 
exclaimed the scout , unconsciously directing the attention of cora to the quarters of her own father , how that shot has made the stnes fly from the side of the commandant s house 
ay 
these frenchers will pull it to pieces fastr than it was put together , solid and thick though it be 
heyward , i sicken at the sight of danger that i cannot share , said the undaunted but anxious daughter 
let us go to montcalm , and demand admission  he dare not deny a child the boon 
you would scarce find the tent of the frenchman with the hair on your head 
if i had but one of the thousand boats which lie empty along that shore , it might be done 
ha 
here will soon be an end of the firing , for yonder comes a fog that will turn day to night , and make an indian arrow more dangerous than a molded cannon 
now , if you are equal to the work , and will follow , i will make a push 
for i long to get down into that camp , if it be only to scatter some mingo dogs that i see lurking in the skirts of yonder thicket of birch 
we are equal , said cora , firmly 
on such an errand we will follow to any danger 
the scout turned to her with a smile of honestand cordial approbation , as he answered  i would i had a thousand men , of brawny limbs and quick eyes , that feared death as little as you 
i would send them jabbering frenchers back into their den again , afore the week was ended , howling like so many fettered hounds or hungry wolves 
sir , he added , turning from her to the restof the party , the fog comes rolling down so fast we shall have but justthe time to meet it on the plain , and use it as a cover 
remember , if any accident should befall me , to keep the air blowing on your left cheeksor , rather , follow the mohicans 
they would scent their way , be it in day or be it at night 
he then waved his hand for them to follow , and threw himself down the step declivity , with free , but careful footstps 
heyward assistd the sistrs to descend , and in a few minutes they were all far down a mountain whose sides they had climbed with so much toil and pain 
the direction taken by hawkeye soon brought the travelers to the level of the plain , nearly opposite to a sallyport in the westrn curtain of the fort , which lay itself at the distnce of about half a mile from the point where he halted to allow duncan to come up with his charge 
in their eagerness , and favored by the nature of the ground , they had anticipated the fog , which was rolling heavily down the lake , and it became necessary to pause , until the mist had wrapped the camp of the enemy in their fleecy mantle 
the mohicans profited by the delay , to stal out of the woods , and to make a survey of surrounding objects 
they were followed at a little distnce by the scout , with a view to profit early by their report , and to obtain some faint knowledge for himself of the more immediate localities 
in a very few moments he returned , his face reddened with vexation , while he muttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import 
here has the cunning frenchman been postng a picket directly in our path , he said 
redskins and whites 
we shall be as likely to fall into their midstas to pass them in the fog 
cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger , asked heyward , and come into our path again when it is passed 
who that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when or how to find it again 
the mist of horican are not like the curls from a peacepipe , or the smoke which settles above a mosquito fire 
he was yet speaking , when a crashing sound was heard , and a cannonball entered the thicket , stiking the body of a sapling , and rebounding to the earth , its force being much expended by previous resistnce 
the indians followed instntly like busy attendants on the terrible messenger , and uncas commenced speaking earnesty and with much action , in the delaware tongue 
it may be so , lad , muttered the scout , when he had ended 
for desperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache 
come , then , the fog is shutting in 
stp 
cried heyward 
firstexplain your expectations 
tis soon done , and a small hope it is 
it is better than nothing 
this shot that you see , added the scout , kicking the harmless iron with his foot , has plowed the  arth in its road from the fort , and we shall hunt for the furrow it has made , when all other signs may fail 
no more words , but follow , or the fog may leave us in the middle of our path , a mark for both armies to shoot at 
heyward perceiving that , in fact , a crisis had arrived , when acts were more required than words , placed himself between the sistrs , and drw them swiftly forward , keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye 
it was soon apparent that hawkeye had not magnified the power of the fog , for before they had proceeded twenty yards , it was difficult for the different individuals of the party to distnguish each other in the vapor 
they had made their little circuit to the left , and were already inclining again toward the right , having , as heyward thought , got over nearly half the distnce to the friendly works , when his ears were saluted with the fierce summons , apparently within twenty feet of them , of  qui va la 
push on 
whispered the scout , once more bending to the left 
push on 
repeated heyward 
when the summons was renewed by a dozen voices , each of which seemed charged with menace 
c estmoi , cried duncan , drgging rather than leading those he supported swiftly onward 
bete

ami de la france 
tu m as plus l air d un ennemi de la france 
arrete ou pardieu je te ferai ami du diable 
non 
feu , camarades , feu 
the order was instntly obeyed , and the fog was strred by the explosion of fifty muskets 
happily , the aim was bad , and the bullets cut the air in a direction a little different from that taken by the fugitives 
though stll so nigh them , that to the unpractised ears of david and the two females , it appeared as if they whisted within a few inches of the organs 
the outcry was renewed , and the order , not only to fire again , but to pursue , was too plainly audible 
when heyward briefly explained the meaning of the words they heard , hawkeye halted and spoke with quick decision and great firmness 
let us deliver our fire , he said 
they will believe it a sortie , and give way , or they will wait for reinforcements 
the scheme was well conceived , but failed in its effects 
the instnt the french heard the pieces , it seemed as if the plain was alive with men , muskets rattling along its whole extent , from the shores of the lake to the furthestboundary of the woods 
we shall drw their entire army upon us , and bring on a general assault , said duncan  lead on , my friend , for your own life and ours 
the scout seemed willing to comply 
in the hurry of the moment , and in the change of position , he had lostthe direction 
in vain he turned either cheek toward the light air 
they felt equally cool 
in this dilemma , uncas lighted on the furrow of the cannon ball , where it had cut the ground in three adjacent anthills 
give me the range 
cries , oaths , voices calling to each other , and the reports of muskets , were now quick and incessant , and , apparently , on every side of them 
suddenly a stong glare of light flashed across the scene , the fog rolled upward in thick wreaths , and several cannons belched across the plain , and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bellowing echoes of the mountain 
tis from the fort 
exclaimed hawkeye , turning short on his tracks 
we , like sticken fools , were rushing to the woods , under the very knives of the maquas 
the instnt their mistke was rectified , the whole party retraced the error with the utmostdiligence 
duncan willingly relinquished the support of cora to the arm of uncas and cora as readily accepted the welcome assistnce 
men , hot and angry in pursuit , were evidently on their footstps , and each instnt threatened their capture , if not their destuction 
point de quartier aux coquins 
cried an eager pursuer , who seemed to direct the operations of the enemy

exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist it is i

shouted the former speaker , in the awful tones of parental agony , the sound reaching even to the woods , and rolling back in solemn echo

throw open the sallyport

pull not a trigger , lestye kill my lambs 
drve off these dogs of france with your stel 
duncan heard the grating of the rust hinges , and darting to the spot , directed by the sound , he met a long line of dark red warriors , passing swiftly toward the glacis 
he knew them for his own battalion of the royal americans , and flying to their head , soon swept every trace of his pursuers from before the works 
for an instnt , cora and alice had stod trembling and bewildered by this unexpected desertion 
before either had leisure for speech , or even thought , an officer of gigantic frame , whose locks were bleached with years and service , but whose air of military grandeur had been rather softened than destoyed by time , rushed out of the body of mist and folded them to his bosom , while large scalding tears rolled down his pale and wrinkled cheeks , and he exclaimed , in the peculiar accent of scotland  for this i thank thee , lord 
let danger come as it will , thy servant is now prepared 
chapter 15 then go we in , to know his embassy 
which i could , with ready guess , declare , before the frenchmen speak a word of it ,king henry v a few succeeding days were passed amid the privations , the uproar , and the dangers of the siege , which was vigorously pressed by a power , againstwhose approaches munro possessed no competent means of resistnce 
it appeared as if webb , with his army , which lay slumbering on the banks of the hudson , had utterly forgotten the stait to which his countrymen were reduced 
montcalm had filled the woods of the portage with his savages , every yell and whoop from whom rang through the british encampment , chilling the hearts of men who were already but too much disposed to magnify the danger 
not so , however , with the besieged 
animated by the words , and stmulated by the examples of their leaders , they had found their courage , and maintained their ancient reputation , with a zeal that did justce to the strn character of their commander 
as if satisfied with the toil of marching through the wilderness to encounter his enemy , the french general , though of approved skill , had neglected to seize the adjacent mountains 
whence the besieged might have been exterminated with impunity , and which , in the more modern warfare of the country , would not have been neglected for a single hour 
this sort of contempt for eminences , or rather drad of the labor of ascending them , might have been termed the besetting weakness of the warfare of the period 
it originated in the simplicity of the indian contest , in which , from the nature of the combats , and the density of the forest , fortresses were rare , and artillery next to useless 
the carelessness engendered by these usages descended even to the war of the revolution and lostthe sttes the important fortress of ticonderoga opening a way for the army of burgoyne into what was then the bosom of the country 
we look back at this ignorance , or infatuation , whichever it may be called , with wonder , knowing that the neglect of an eminence , whose difficulties , like those of mount defiance , have been so greatly exaggerated , would , at the present time , prove fatal to the reputation of the engineer who had planned the works at their base , or to that of the general whose lot it was to defend them 
the tourist the valetudinarian , or the amateur of the beauties of nature , who , in the train of his fourinhand , now rolls through the scenes we have attempted to describe , in questof information , health , or pleasure , or floats stadily toward his object on those artificial waters which has dared to stke his political character on the hazardous issue , is not to suppose that his ancestrs traversed those hills , or stuggled with the same currents with equal facility 
the transportation of a single heavy gun was often considered equal to a victory gained 
if happily , the difficulties of the passage had not so far separated it from its necessary concomitant , the ammunition , as to render it no more than a useless tube of unwieldy iron 
governor of new york in 1828 
the evils of this stte of things pressed heavily on the fortunes of the resolute scotsman who now defended william henry 
though his adversary neglected the hills , he had planted his batteries with judgment on the plain , and caused them to be served with vigor and skill 
againstthis assault , the besieged could only oppose the imperfect and hast preparations of a fortress in the wilderness 
it was in the afternoon of the fifth day of the siege , and the fourth of his own service in it , that major heyward profited by a parley that had justbeen beaten , by repairing to the ramparts of one of the water bastons , to breathe the cool air from the lake , and to take a survey of the progress of the siege 
he was alone , if the solitary sentinel who paced the mound be excepted 
for the artillerist had hastned also to profit by the temporary suspension of their arduous duties 
the evening was delightfully calm , and the light air from the limpid water fresh and soothing 
it seemed as if , with the termination of the roar of artillery and the plunging of shot , nature had also seized the moment to assume her mildestand mostcaptivating form 
the sun poured down his parting glory on the scene , without the oppression of those fierce rays that belong to the climate and the season 
the mountains looked green , and fresh , and lovely , tempered with the milder light , or softened in shadow , as thin vapors floated between them and the sun 
the numerous islands restd on the bosom of the horican , some low and sunken , as if embedded in the waters , and others appearing to hover about the element , in little hillocks of green velvet 
among which the fishermen of the beleaguering army peacefully rowed their skiffs , or floated at reston the glassy mirror in quiet pursuit of their employment 
the scene was at once animated and stll 
all that pertained to nature was sweet , or simply grand 
while those parts which depended on the temper and movements of man were lively and playful 
two little spotless flags were abroad , the one on a salient angle of the fort , and the other on the advanced battery of the besiegers 
emblems of the truth which existd , not only to the acts , but it would seem , also , to the enmity of the combatants 
behind these again swung , heavily opening and closing in silken folds , the rival stndards of england and france 
a hundrd gay and thoughtless young frenchmen were drwing a net to the pebbly beach , within dangerous proximity to the sullen but silent cannon of the fort , while the eastrn mountain was sending back the loud shouts and gay merriment that attended their sport 
me were rushing eagerly to enjoy the aquatic games of the lake , and others were already toiling their way up the neighboring hills , with the restess curiosity of their nation 
to all these sports and pursuits , those of the enemy who watched the besieged , and the besieged themselves , were , however , merely the idle though sympathizing spectators 
here and there a picket had , indeed , raised a song , or mingled in a dance , which had drwn the dusky savages around them , from their lairs in the forest  in short , everything wore rather the appearance of a day of pleasure , than of an hour stlen from the dangers and toil of a bloody and vindictive warfare 
duncan had stod in a musing attitude , contemplating this scene a few minutes , when his eyes were directed to the glacis in front of the sallyport already mentioned , by the sounds of approaching footstps 
he walked to an angle of the baston , and beheld the scout advancing , under the custdy of a french officer , to the body of the fort 
the countenance of hawkeye was haggard and careworn , and his air dejected , as though he felt the deepestdegradation at having fallen into the power of his enemies 
he was without his favorite weapon , and his arms were even bound behind him with thongs , made of the skin of a deer 
the arrival of flags to cover the messengers of summons , had occurred so often of late , that when heyward firstthrew his careless glance on this group , he expected to see another of the officers of the enemy , charged with a similar office but the instnt he recognized the tall person and stll strdy though downcastfeatures of his friend , the woodsman , he strted with surprise , and turned to descend from the baston into the bosom of the work 
the sounds of other voices , however , caught his attention , and for a moment caused him to forget his purpose 
at the inner angle of the mound he met the sistrs , walking along the parapet , in search , like himself , of air and relief from confinement 
they had not met from that painful moment when he deserted them on the plain , only to assure their safety 
he had parted from them worn with care , and jaded with fatigue 
he now saw them refreshed and blooming , though timid and anxious 
under such an inducement it will cause no surprise that the young man lostsight for a time , of other objects in order to addrss them 
he was , however , anticipated by the voice of the ingenuous and youthful alice 

thou tyrant 
thou recreant knight 
he who abandons his damsels in the very list , she cried 
here have we been days , nay , ages , expecting you at our feet , imploring mercy and forgetfulness of your craven backsliding , or i should rather say , backrunningfor verily you fled in the manner that no sticken deer , as our worthy friend the scout would say , could equal 
you know that alice means our thanks and our blessings , added the graver and more thoughtful cora 
in truth , we have a little wonder why you should so rigidly absent yourself from a place where the gratitude of the daughters might receive the support of a parent s thanks 
your father himself could tell you , that , though absent from your presence , i have not been altogether forgetful of your safety , returned the young man 
the mastry of yonder village of huts , pointing to the neighboring entrenched camp , has been keenly disputed 
he who holds it is sure to be possessed of this fort , and that which it contains 
my days and nights have all been passed there since we separated , because i thought that duty called me thither 
he added , with an air of chagrin , which he endeavored , though unsuccessfully , to conceal , had i been aware that what i then believed a soldier s conduct could be so constued , shame would have been added to the listof reasons 
heyward 
duncan 
exclaimed alice , bending forward to read his halfaverted countenance , until a lock of her golden hair restd on her flushed cheek , and nearly concealed the tear that had strted to her eye 
did i think this idle tongue of mine had pained you , i would silence it forever 
cora can say , if cora would , how justy we have prized your services , and how deepi had almostsaid , how fervent is our gratitude 
will cora attestthe truth of this 
cried duncan , suffering the cloud to be chased from his countenance by a smile of open pleasure 
what says our graver sistr 
will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier 
cora made no immediate answer , but turned her face toward the water , as if looking on the sheet of the horican 
when she did bend her dark eyes on the young man , they were yet filled with an expression of anguish that at once drve every thought but that of kind solicitude from his mind 
you are not well , dearestmiss munro 
he exclaimed 
we have trifled while you are in suffering 
tis nothing , she answered , refusing his support with feminine reserve 
that i cannot see the sunny side of the picture of life , like this artless but ardent enthusiast she added , laying her hand lightly , but affectionately , on the arm of her sistr , is the penalty of experience , and , perhaps , the misfortune of my nature 
see , she continued , as if determined to shake off infirmity , in a sense of duty 
look around you , major heyward , and tell me what a prospect is this for the daughter of a soldier whose greatesthappiness is his honor and his military renown 
neither ought nor shall be tarnished by circumstnces over which he has had no control , duncan warmly replied 
your words recall me to my own duty 
i go now to your gallant father , to hear his determination in matters of the lastmoment to the defense 
god bless you in every fortune , noblecorai may and mustcall you 
she frankly gave him her hand , though her lip quivered , and her cheeks gradually became of ashly paleness 
in every fortune , i know you will be an ornament and honor to your sex 
alice , adieuhis voice changed from admiration to tenderness adieu , alice 
we shall soon meet again 
as conquerors , i trust and amid rejoicings 
without waiting for an answer from either , the young man threw himself down the grassy stps of the baston , and moving rapidly across the parade , he was quickly in the presence of their father 
munro was pacing his narrow apartment with a distrbed air and gigantic stides as duncan entered 
you have anticipated my wishes , major heyward , he said 
i was about to requestthis favor 
i am sorry to see , sir , that the messenger i so warmly recommended has returned in custdy of the french 
i hope there is no reason to distusthis fidelity 
the fidelity of  the long rifle  is well known to me , returned munro , and is above suspicion 
though his usual good fortune seems , at last to have failed 
montcalm has got him , and with the accursed politeness of his nation , he has sent him in with a doleful tale , of  knowing how i valued the fellow , he could not think of retaining him  a jesuitical way that , major duncan heyward , of telling a man of his misfortunes 
the general and his succor 
did ye look to the south as ye entered , and could ye not see them 
hoot 
hoot 
you are an impatient boy , sir , and cannot give the gentlemen leisure for their march 
they are coming , then 
the scout has said as much 
when 
by what path 
for the dunce has omitted to tell me this 
there is a letter , it would seem , too 
that is the only agreeable part of the matter 
for the custmary attentions of your marquis of montcalmi warrant me , duncan , that he of lothian would buy a dozen such marquisatesbut if the news of the letter were bad , the gentility of this french monsieur would certainly compel him to let us know it 
he keeps the letter , then , while he releases the messenger 
ay , that does he , and all for the sake of what you call your  bonhommie  i would venture , if the truth was known , the fellow s grandfather taught the noble science of dancing 
what says the scout 
he has eyes and ears , and a tongue 
what verbal report does he make 
oh 
sir , he is not wanting in natural organs , and he is free to tell all that he has seen and heard 
the whole amount is this 
there is a fort of his majest s on the banks of the hudson , called edward , in honor of his gracious highness of york , you will know 
it is well filled with armed men , as such a work should be 
was there no movement , no signs of any intention to advance to our relief 
there were the morning and evening parades 
when one of the provincial loonsyou will know , dunca , you are half a scotsman yourselfwhen one of them drpped his powder over his porretch , if it touched the coals , it justburned 
suddenly changing his bitter , ironical manner , to one more grave and thoughtful , he continued  and yet there might , and mustbe , something in that letter which it would be well to know 
our decision should be speedy , said duncan , gladly availing himself of this change of humor , to press the more important objects of their interview 
i cannot conceal from you , sir , that the camp will not be much longer tenable 
i am sorry to add , that things appear no better in the fort 
more than half the guns are burstd 
how should it be otherwise 
me were fished from the bottom of the lake 
me have been rustng in woods since the discovery of the country 
some were never guns at allmere privateersmen s playthings 
do you think , sir , you can have woolwich warren in the midstof a wilderness , three thousand miles from great britain 
the walls are crumbling about our ears , and provisions begin to fail us , continued heyward , without regarding the new burstof indignation 
even the men show signs of discontent and alarm 
major heyward , said munro , turning to his youthful associate with the dignity of his years and superior rank 
i should have served his majest for half a century , and earned these gray hairs in vain , were i ignorant of all you say , and of the pressing nature of our circumstnces 
stll , there is everything due to the honor of the king s arms , and something to ourselves 
while there is hope of succor , this fortress will i defend , though it be to be done with pebbles gathered on the lake shore 
it is a sight of the letter , therefore , that we want , that we may know the intentions of the man the earl of loudon has left among us as his substtute 
can i be of service in the matter 
sir , you can 
the marquis of montcalm has , in addition to his other civilities , invited me to a personal interview between the works and his own camp 
in order , as he says , to impart some additional information 
now , i think it would not be wise to show any undue solicitude to meet him , and i would employ you , an officer of rank , as my substtute 
for it would but ill comport with the honor of scotland to let it be said one of her gentlemen was outdone in civility by a native of any other country on earth 
without assuming the supererogatory task of entering into a discussion of the comparative merits of national courtesy , duncan cheerfully assented to supply the place of the veteran in the approaching interview 
a long and confidential communication now succeeded , during which the young man received some additional insight into his duty , from the experience and native acuteness of his commander , and then the former took his leave 
as duncan could only act as the representative of the commandant of the fort , the ceremonies which should have accompanied a meeting between the heads of the adverse forces were , of course , dispensed with 
the truce stll existd , and with a roll and beat of the drm , and covered by a little white flag , duncan left the sallyport , within ten minutes after his instuctions were ended 
he was received by the french officer in advance with the usual formalities , and immediately accompanied to a distnt marquee of the renowned soldier who led the forces of france 
the general of the enemy received the youthful messenger , surrounded by his principal officers , and by a swarthy band of the native chiefs , who had followed him to the field , with the warriors of their several tribes 
heyward paused short , when , in glancing his eyes rapidly over the dark group of the latter , he beheld the malignant countenance of magua , regarding him with the calm but sullen attention which marked the expression of that subtle savage 
a slight exclamation of surprise even burstfrom the lips of the young man , but instntly , recollecting his errand , and the presence in which he stod , he suppressed every appearance of emotion , and turned to the hostle leader , who had already advanced a stp to receive him 
the marquis of montcalm was , at the period of which we write , in the flower of his age , and , it may be added , in the zenith of his fortunes 
even in that enviable situation , he was affable , and distnguished as much for his attention to the forms of courtesy , as for that chivalrous courage which , only two short years afterward , induced him to throw away his life on the plains of abr am 
duncan , in turning his eyes from the malign expression of magua , suffered them to restwith pleasure on the smiling and polished features , and the noble military air , of the french general 
monsieur , said the latter , j ai beaucoup de plaisir a b  
ou estcet interprete 
je crois , monsieur , qu il ne sear pas necessaire , heyward modesty replied 
jparle un peu fran‡ais 

j en suis bien aise , said montcalm , taking duncan familiarly by the arm , and leading him deep into the marquee , a little out of earshot 
je detest ces fripons la 
on ne sait jamais sur quel pie on estavec eux 
eh , bien 
monsieur , he continued stll speaking in french 
though i should have been proud of receiving your commandant , i am very happy that he has seen proper to employ an officer so distnguished , and who , i am sure , is so amiable , as yourself 
duncan bowed low , pleased with the compliment , in spite of a mostheroic determination to suffer no artifice to allure him into forgetfulness of the interestof his prince 
montcalm , after a pause of a moment , as if to collect his thoughts , proceeded  your commandant is a brave man , and well qualified to repel my assault 
mais , monsieur , is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity , and less of your courage 
the one as stongly characterizes the hero as the other 
we consider the qualities as inseparable , returned duncan , smiling 
while we find in the vigor of your excellency every motive to stmulate the one , we can , as yet , see no particular call for the exercise of the other 
montcalm , in his turn , slightly bowed , but it was with the air of a man too practised to remember the language of flattery 
after musing a moment , he added  it is possible my glasses have deceived me , and that your works resistour cannon better than i had supposed 
you know our force 
our accounts vary , said duncan , carelessly 
the highest however , has not exceeded twenty thousand men 
the frenchman bit his lip , and fastned his eyes keenly on the other as if to read his thoughts 
with a readiness peculiar to himself , he continued , as if assenting to the truth of an enumeration which quite doubled his army  it is a poor compliment to the vigilance of us soldiers , monsieur , that , do what we will , we never can conceal our numbers 
if it were to be done at all , one would believe it might succeed in these woods 
though you think it too soon to listn to the calls of humanity , he added , smiling archly , i may be permitted to believe that gallantry is not forgotten by one so young as yourself 
the daughters of the commandant , i learn , have passed into the fort since it was investd 
it is true , monsieur 
so far from weakening our efforts , they set us an example of courage in their own fortitude 
were nothing but resolution necessary to repel so accomplished a soldier as m 
de montcalm , i would gladly trustthe defense of william henry to the elder of those ladies 
we have a wise ordinance in our salique laws , which says ,  the crown of france shall never degrade the lance to the distff  , said montcalm , drly , and with a little hauteur 
instntly adding , with his former frank and easy air  as all the nobler qualities are hereditary , i can easily credit you 
though , as i said before , courage has its limits , and humanity mustnot be forgotten 
i trust monsieur , you come authorized to treat for the surrender of the place 
has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary 
i should be sorry to have the defense protracted in such a manner as to irritate my red friends there , continued montcalm , glancing his eyes at the group of grave and attentive indians , without attending to the other s questons 
i find it difficult , even now , to limit them to the usages of war 
heyward was silent 
for a painful recollection of the dangers he had so recently escaped came over his mind , and recalled the images of those defenseless beings who had shared in all his sufferings 
ces messieursla , said montcalm , following up the advantage which he conceived he had gained , are mostformidable when baffled 
it is unnecessary to tell you with what difficulty they are restained in their anger 
eh bien , monsieur 
shall we speak of the terms 
i fear your excellency has been deceived as to the stength of william henry , and the resources of its garrison 
i have not sat down before quebec , but an earthen work , that is defended by twentythree hundrd gallant men , was the laconic reply 
our mounds are earthen , certainlynor are they seated on the rocks of cape diamond 
they stnd on that shore which proved so destuctive to dieskau and his army 
there is also a powerful force within a few hours  march of us , which we account upon as a part of our means 
me six or eight thousand men , returned montcalm , with much apparent indifference , whom their leader wisely judges to be safer in their works than in the field 
it was now heyward s turn to bite his lip with vexation as the other so coolly alluded to a force which the young man knew to be overrated 
both mused a little while in silence , when montcalm renewed the conversation , in a way that showed he believed the visit of his guestwas solely to propose terms of capitulation 
on the other hand , heyward began to throw sundr inducements in the way of the french general , to betray the discoveries he had made through the intercepted letter 
the artifice of neither , however , succeeded 
after a protracted and fruitless interview , duncan took his leave , favorably impressed with an opinion of the courtesy and talents of the enemy s captain , but as ignorant of what he came to learn as when he arrived 
montcalm followed him as far as the entrance of the marquee , renewing his invitations to the commandant of the fort to give him an immediate meeting in the open ground between the two armies 
there they separated , and duncan returned to the advanced postof the french , accompanied as before 
whence he instntly proceeded to the fort , and to the quarters of his own commander 
chapter 16 edg

lear major heyward found munro attended only by his daughters 
alice sat upon his knee , parting the gray hairs on the forehead of the old man with her delicate fingers 
whenever he affected to frown on her trifling , appeasing his assumed anger by pressing her ruby lips fondly on his wrinkled brow 
cora was seated nigh them , a calm and amused lookeron 
regarding the wayward movements of her more youthful sistr with that species of maternal fondness which characterized her love for alice 
not only the dangers through which they had passed , but those which stll impended above them , appeared to be momentarily forgotten , in the soothing indulgence of such a family meeting 
it seemed as if they had profited by the short truce , to devote an instnt to the purestand bestaffection 
the daughters forgetting their fears , and the veteran his cares , in the security of the moment 
of this scene , duncan , who , in his eagerness to report his arrival , had entered unannounced , stod many moments an unobserved and a delighted spectator 
the quick and dancing eyes of alice soon caught a glimpse of his figure reflected from a glass , and she sprang blushing from her father s knee , exclaiming aloud  major heyward 
what of the lad 
demanded her father 
i have sent him to crack a little with the frenchman 
ha , sir , you are young , and you are nimble 
away with you , ye baggage 
as if there were not troubles enough for a soldier , without having his camp filled with such prattling hussies as yourself 
alice laughingly followed her sistr , who instntly led the way from an apartment where she perceived their presence was no longer desirable 
munro , instad of demanding the result of the young man s mission , paced the room for a few moments , with his hands behind his back , and his head inclined toward the floor , like a man lostin thought 
at length he raised his eyes , glistning with a father s fondness , and exclaimed  they are a pair of excellent girls , heyward , and such as any one may boastof 
you are not now to learn my opinion of your daughters , colonel munro 
true , lad , true , interrupted the impatient old man 
you were about opening your mind more fully on that matter the day you got in , but i did not think it becoming in an old soldier to be talking of nuptial blessings and wedding jokes when the enemies of his king were likely to be unbidden guest at the feast  but i was wrong , duncan , boy , i was wrong there 
i am now ready to hear what you have to say 
notwithstnding the pleasure your assurance gives me , dear sir , i have justnow , a message from montcalm let the frenchman and all his hostgo to the devil , sir 
exclaimed the hast veteran 
he is not yet mastr of william henry , nor shall he ever be , provided webb proves himself the man he should 
no , sir , thank heaven we are not yet in such a stait that it can be said munro is too much pressed to discharge the little domestc duties of his own family 
your mother was the only child of my bosom friend , duncan 
i will justgive you a hearing , though all the knights of st  louis were in a body at the sallyport , with the french saint at their head , crying to speak a word under favor 
a pretty degree of knighthood , sir , is that which can be bought with sugar hogsheads 
then your twopenny marquisates 
the thiste is the order for dignity and antiquity 
the veritable  nemo me impune lacessit  of chivalry 
ye had ancestrs in that degree , duncan , and they were an ornament to the nobles of scotland 
heyward , who perceived that his superior took a malicious pleasure in exhibiting his contempt for the message of the french general , was fain to humor a spleen that he knew would be shortlived 
he therefore , replied with as much indifference as he could assume on such a subject  my request as you know , sir , went so far as to presume to the honor of being your son 
ay , boy , you found words to make yourself very plainly comprehended 
let me ask ye , sir , have you been as intelligible to the girl 
on my honor , no , exclaimed duncan , warmly 
there would have been an abuse of a confided trust had i taken advantage of my situation for such a purpose 
your notions are those of a gentleman , major heyward , and well enough in their place 
cora munro is a maiden too discreet , and of a mind too elevated and improved , to need the guardianship even of a father 
cora 
aycora 
we are talking of your pretensions to miss munro , are we not , sir 
iii was not conscious of having mentioned her name , said duncan , stmmering 
to marry whom , then , did you wish my consent , major heyward 
demanded the old soldier , erecting himself in the dignity of offended feeling 
you have another , and not less lovely child 
alice 
exclaimed the father , in an astnishment equal to that with which duncan had justrepeated the name of her sistr 
such was the direction of my wishes , sir 
the young man awaited in silence the result of the extraordinary effect produced by a communication , which , as it now appeared , was so unexpected 
for several minutes munro paced the chamber with long and rapid stides , his rigid features working convulsively , and every faculty seemingly absorbed in the musings of his own mind 
at length , he paused directly in front of heyward , and riveting his eyes upon those of the other , he said , with a lip that quivered violently  duncan heyward , i have loved you for the sake of him whose blood is in your veins 
i have loved you for your own good qualities 
i have loved you , because i thought you would contribute to the happiness of my child 
all this love would turn to hatred , were i assured that what i so much apprehend is true 
god forbid that any act or thought of mine should lead to such a change 
exclaimed the young man , whose eye never quailed under the penetrating look it encountered 
without adverting to the impossibility of the other s comprehending those feelings which were hid in his own bosom , munro suffered himself to be appeased by the unaltered countenance he met , and with a voice sensibly softened , he continued  you would be my son , duncan , and you are ignorant of the histry of the man you wish to call your father 
sit ye down , young man , and i will open to you the wounds of a seared heart , in as few words as may be suitable 
by this time , the message of montcalm was as much forgotten by him who bore it as by the man for whose ears it was intended 
each drw a chair , and while the veteran communed a few moments with his own thoughts , apparently in sadness , the youth suppressed his impatience in a look and attitude of respectful attention 
at length , the former spoke  you will know , already , major heyward , that my family was both ancient and honorable , commenced the scotsman 
though it might not altogether be endowed with that amount of wealth that should correspond with its degree 
i was , maybe , such an one as yourself when i plighted my faith to alice gr am , the only child of a neighboring laird of some estte 
the connection was disagreeable to her father , on more accounts than my poverty 
i did , therefore , what an honestman shouldrstred the maiden her troth , and departed the country in the service of my king 
i had seen many regions , and had shed much blood in different lands , before duty called me to the islands of the westindies 
there it was my lot to form a connection with one who in time became my wife , and the mother of cora 
she was the daughter of a gentleman of those isles , by a lady whose misfortune it was , if you will , said the old man , proudly , to be descended , remotely , from that unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved to administr to the wants of a luxurious people 
ay , sir , that is a curse , entailed on scotland by her unnatural union with a foreign and trading people 
could i find a man among them who would dare to reflect on my child , he should feel the weight of a father s anger 
ha 
major heyward , you are yourself born at the south , where these unfortunate beings are considered of a race inferior to your own 
tis mostunfortunately true , sir , said duncan , unable any longer to prevent his eyes from sinking to the floor in embarrassment 
you castit on my child as a reproach 
you scorn to mingle the blood of the heywards with one so degraded lovely and virtuous though she be 
fiercely demanded the jealous parent 
heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason 
returned duncan , at the same time conscious of such a feeling , and that as deeply rooted as if it had been ingrafted in his nature 
the sweetness , the beauty , the witchery of your younger daughter , colonel munro , might explain my motives without imputing to me this injustce 
ye are right , sir , returned the old man , again changing his tones to those of gentleness , or rather softness 
the girl is the image of what her mother was at her years , and before she had become acquainted with grief 
when death deprived me of my wife i returned to scotland , enriched by the marriage 
would you think it , duncan 
the suffering angel had remained in the heartless stte of celibacy twenty long years , and that for the sake of a man who could forget her 
she did more , sir 
she overlooked my want of faith , and , all difficulties being now removed , she took me for her husband 
became the mother of alice 
exclaimed duncan , with an eagerness that might have proved dangerous at a moment when the thoughts of munro were less occupied that at present 
she did , indeed , said the old man , and dearly did she pay for the blessing she bestwed 
she is a saint in heaven , sir 
it ill becomes one whose foot rest on the grave to mourn a lot so blessed 
i had her but a single year , though 
a short term of happiness for one who had seen her youth fade in hopeless pining 
there was something so commanding in the distess of the old man , that heyward did not dare to venture a syllable of consolation 
munro sat utterly unconscious of the other s presence , his features exposed and working with the anguish of his regrets , while heavy tears fell from his eyes , and rolled unheeded from his cheeks to the floor 
at length he moved , and as if suddenly recovering his recollection 
when he arose , and taking a single turn across the room , he approached his companion with an air of military grandeur , and demanded  have you not , major heyward , some communication that i should hear from the marquis de montcalm 
duncan strted in his turn , and immediately commenced in an embarrassed voice , the halfforgotten message 
it is unnecessary to dwell upon the evasive though polite manner with which the french general had eluded every attempt of heyward to worm from him the purport of the communication he had proposed making , or on the decided , though stll polished message , by which he now gave his enemy to understnd , that , unless he chose to receive it in person , he should not receive it at all 
as munro listned to the detail of duncan , the excited feelings of the father gradually gave way before the obligations of his sttion , and when the other was done , he saw before him nothing but the veteran , swelling with the wounded feelings of a soldier 
you have said enough , major heyward , exclaimed the angry old man 
enough to make a volume of commentary on french civility 
here has this gentleman invited me to a conference , and when i send him a capable substtute , for ye are all that , duncan , though your years are but few , he answers me with a riddle 
he may have thought less favorably of the substtute , my dear sir 
you will remember that the invitation , which he now repeats , was to the commandant of the works , and not to his second 
well , sir , is not a substtute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission 
he wishes to confer with munro 
faith , sir , i have much inclination to indulge the man , if it should only be to let him behold the firm countenance we maintain in spite of his numbers and his summons 
there might be not bad policy in such a stoke , young man 
duncan , who believe it of the lastimportance that they should speedily come to the contents of the letter borne by the scout , gladly encouraged this idea 
without doubt , he could gather no confidence by witnessing our indifference , he said 
you never said truer word 
i could wish , sir , that he would visit the works in open day , and in the form of a strming party 
that is the leastfailing method of proving the countenance of an enemy , and would be far preferable to the battering systm he has chosen 
the beauty and manliness of warfare has been much deformed , major heyward , by the arts of your monsieur vauban 
our ancestrs were far above such scientific cowardice 
it may be very true , sir 
we are now obliged to repel art by art 
what is your pleasure in the matter of the interview 
i will meet the frenchman , and that without fear or delay 
promptly , sir , as becomes a servant of my royal mastr 
go , major heyward , and give them a flourish of the music 
send out a messenger to let them know who is coming 
we will follow with a small guard , for such respect is due to one who holds the honor of his king in keeping 
hark ee , duncan , he added , in a half whisper , though they were alone , it may be prudent to have some aid at hand , in case there should be treachery at the bottom of it all 
the young man availed himself of this order to quit the apartment 
as the day was fastcoming to a close , he hastned without delay , to make the necessary arrangements 
a very few minutes only were necessary to parade a few files , and to dispatch an orderly with a flag to announce the approach of the commandant of the fort 
when duncan had done both these , he led the guard to the sallyport , near which he found his superior ready , waiting his appearance 
as soon as the usual ceremonials of a military departure were observed , the veteran and his more youthful companion left the fortress , attended by the escort 
they had proceeded only a hundrd yards from the works , when the little array which attended the french general to the conference was seen issuing from the hollow way which formed the bed of a brook that ran between the batteries of the besiegers and the fort 
from the moment that munro left his own works to appear in front of his enemy s , his air had been grand , and his stp and countenance highly military 
the instnt he caught a glimpse of the white plume that waved in the hat of montcalm , his eye lighted , and age no longer appeared to possess any influence over his vastand stll muscular person 
speak to the boys to be watchful , sir , he said , in an undertone , to duncan 
to look well to their flints and stel , for one is never safe with a servant of these louis s 
at the same time , we shall show them the front of men in deep security 
ye will understnd me , major heyward 
he was interrupted by the clamor of a drm from the approaching frenchmen , which was immediately answered , when each party pushed an orderly in advance , bearing a white flag , and the wary scotsman halted with his guard close at his back 
as soon as this slight salutation had passed , montcalm moved toward them with a quick but graceful stp , baring his head to the veteran , and drpping his spotless plume nearly to the earth in courtesy 
if the air of munro was more commanding and manly , it wanted both the ease and insinuating polish of that of the frenchman 
neither spoke for a few moments , each regarding the other with curious and interestd eyes 
as became his superior rank and the nature of the interview , montcalm broke the silence 
after uttering the usual words of greeting , he turned to duncan , and continued , with a smile of recognition , speaking always in french  i am rejoiced , monsieur , that you have given us the pleasure of your company on this occasion 
there will be no necessity to employ an ordinary interpreter 
for , in your hands , i feel the same security as if i spoke your language myself 
duncan acknowledged the compliment , when montcalm , turning to his guard , which in imitation of that of their enemies , pressed close upon him , continued  en arriere , mes enfantsil fait chaudrtirezvous un peu 
before major heyward would imitate this proof of confidence , he glanced his eyes around the plain , and beheld with uneasiness the numerous dusky groups of savages , who looked out from the margin of the surrounding woods , curious spectators of the interview 
monsieur de montcalm will readily acknowledge the difference in our situation , he said , with some embarrassment , pointing at the same time toward those dangerous foes , who were to be seen in almostevery direction 
were we to dismiss our guard , we should stnd here at the mercy of our enemies 
monsieur , you have the plighted faith of  un gentilhomme fran‡ais  , for your safety , returned montcalm , laying his hand impressively on his heart 
it should suffice 
it shall 
fall back , duncan added to the officer who led the escort 
fall back , sir , beyond hearing , and wait for orders 
munro witnessed this movement with manifestuneasiness 
nor did he fail to demand an instnt explanation 
is it not our interest sir , to betray distust retorted duncan 
monsieur de montcalm pledges his word for our safety , and i have ordered the men to withdrw a little , in order to prove how much we depend on his assurance 
it may be all right , sir , but i have no overweening reliance on the faith of these marquesses , or marquis , as they call themselves 
their patents of nobility are too common to be certain that they bear the seal of true honor 
you forget , dear sir , that we confer with an officer , distnguished alike in europe and america for his deeds 
from a soldier of his reputation we can have nothing to apprehend 
the old man made a gestre of resignation , though his rigid features stll betrayed his obstnate adherence to a distust which he derived from a sort of hereditary contempt of his enemy , rather than from any present signs which might warrant so uncharitable a feeling 
montcalm waited patiently until this little dialogue in demivoice was ended , when he drw nigher , and opened the subject of their conference 
i have solicited this interview from your superior , monsieur , he said , because i believe he will allow himself to be persuaded that he has already done everything which is necessary for the honor of his prince , and will now listn to the admonitions of humanity 
i will forever bear testmony that his resistnce has been gallant , and was continued as long as there was hope 
when this opening was translated to munro , he answered with dignity , but with sufficient courtesy  however i may prize such testmony from monsieur montcalm , it will be more valuable when it shall be better merited 
the french general smiled , as duncan gave him the purport of this reply , and observed  what is now so freely accorded to approved courage , may be refused to useless obstnacy 
monsieur would wish to see my camp , and witness for himself our numbers , and the impossibility of his resistng them with success 
i know that the king of france is well served , returned the unmoved scotsman , as soon as duncan ended his translation 
my own royal mastr has as many and as faithful troops 
though not at hand , fortunately for us , said montcalm , without waiting , in his ardor , for the interpreter 
there is a destny in war , to which a brave man knows how to submit with the same courage that he faces his foes 
had i been conscious that monsieur montcalm was mastr of the english , i should have spared myself the trouble of so awkward a translation , said the vexed duncan , drly 
remembering instntly his recent byplay with munro 
your pardon , monsieur , rejoined the frenchman , suffering a slight color to appear on his dark cheek 
there is a vastdifference between understnding and speaking a foreign tongue 
you will , therefore , please to assistme stll 
after a short pause , he added  these hills afford us every opportunity of reconnoitering your works , messieurs , and i am possibly as well acquainted with their weak condition as you can be yourselves 
ask the french general if his glasses can reach to the hudson , said munro , proudly 
if he knows when and where to expect the army of webb 
let general webb be his own interpreter , returned the politic montcalm , suddenly extending an open letter toward munro as he spoke 
you will there learn , monsieur , that his movements are not likely to prove embarrassing to my army 
the veteran seized the offered paper , without waiting for duncan to translate the speech , and with an eagerness that betrayed how important he deemed its contents 
as his eye passed hastly over the words , his countenance changed from its look of military pride to one of deep chagrin 
his lip began to quiver 
suffering the paper to fall from his hand , his head drpped upon his chest like that of a man whose hopes were withered at a single blow 
duncan caught the letter from the ground , and without apology for the liberty he took , he read at a glance its cruel purport 
their common superior , so far from encouraging them to resist advised a speedy surrender , urging in the plainestlanguage , as a reason , the utter impossibility of his sending a single man to their rescue 
here is no deception 
exclaimed duncan , examining the billet both inside and out 
this is the signature of webb , and mustbe the captured letter 
the man has betrayed me 
munro at length bitterly exclaimed 
he has brought dishonor to the door of one where disgrace was never before known to dwell , and shame has he heaped heavily on my gray hairs 
say not so , cried duncan 
we are yet mastrs of the fort , and of our honor 
let us , then , sell our lives at such a rate as shall make our enemies believe the purchase too dear 
boy , i thank thee , exclaimed the old man , rousing himself from his stpor 
you have , for once , reminded munro of his duty 
we will go back , and dig our graves behind those ramparts 
messieurs , said montcalm , advancing toward them a stp , in generous interest you little know louis de st  veran if you believe him capable of profiting by this letter to humble brave men , or to build up a dishonestreputation for himself 
listn to my terms before you leave me 
what says the frenchman 
demanded the veteran , strnly 
does he make a merit of having captured a scout , with a note from headquarters 
sir , he had better raise this siege , to go and sit down before edward if he wishes to frighten his enemy with words 
duncan explained the other s meaning 
monsieur de montcalm , we will hear you , the veteran added , more calmly , as duncan ended 
to retain the fort is now impossible , said his liberal enemy 
it is necessary to the interest of my mastr that it should be destoyed 
as for yourselves and your brave comrdes , there is no privilege dear to a soldier that shall be denied 
our colors 
demanded heyward 
carry them to england , and show them to your king 
our arms 
keep them 
none can use them better 
our march 
the surrender of the place 
shall all be done in a way mosthonorable to yourselves 
duncan now turned to explain these proposals to his commander , who heard him with amazement , and a sensibility that was deeply touched by so unusual and unexpected generosity 
go you , duncan , he said 
go with this marquess , as , indeed , marquess he should be 
go to his marquee and arrange it all 
i have lived to see two things in my old age that never did i expect to behold 
an englishman afraid to support a friend , and a frenchman too honestto profit by his advantage 
saying , the veteran again drpped his head to his chest and returned slowly toward the fort , exhibiting , by the dejection of his air , to the anxious garrison , a harbinger of evil tidings 
from the shock of this unexpected blow the haughty feelings of munro never recovered 
from that moment there commenced a change in his determined character , which accompanied him to a speedy grave 
duncan remained to settle the terms of the capitulation 
he was seen to re enter the works during the firstwatches of the night , and immediately after a private conference with the commandant , to leave them again 
it was then openly announced that hostlities mustceasemunro having signed a treaty by which the place was to be yielded to the enemy , with the morning 
the garrison to retain their arms , the colors and their baggage , and , consequently , according to military opinion , their honor 
chapter 17 weave we the woof 
the thread is spun 
the web is wove 
the work is done 
gray the hostle armies , which lay in the wilds of the horican , passed the night of the ninth of august 1757 , much in the manner they would , had they encountered on the fairestfield of europe 
while the conquered were stll , sullen , and dejected , the victors triumphed 
there are limits alike to grief and joy 
long before the watches of the morning came the stllness of those boundless woods was only broken by a gay call from some exulting young frenchman of the advanced pickets , or a menacing challenge from the fort , which strnly forbade the approach of any hostle footstps before the stpulated moment 
even these occasional threatening sounds ceased to be heard in that dull hour which precedes the day , at which period a listner might have sought in vain any evidence of the presence of those armed powers that then slumbered on the shores of the holy lake 
it was during these moments of deep silence that the canvas which concealed the entrance to a spacious marquee in the french encampment was shoved aside , and a man issued from beneath the drpery into the open air 
he was enveloped in a cloak that might have been intended as a protection from the chilling damps of the woods , but which served equally well as a mantle to conceal his person 
he was permitted to pass the grenadier , who watched over the slumbers of the french commander , without interruption , the man making the usual salute which betokens military deference , as the other passed swiftly through the little city of tents , in the direction of william henry 
whenever this unknown individual encountered one of the numberless sentinels who crossed his path , his answer was prompt , and , as it appeared , satisfactory 
for he was uniformly allowed to proceed without further interrogation 
with the exception of such repeated but brief interruptions , he had moved silently from the center of the camp to its mostadvanced outpost , when he drw nigh the soldier who held his watch nearestto the works of the enemy 
as he approached he was received with the usual challenge  qui vive 
france , was the reply 
le mot d ordr 
la victorie , said the other , drwing so nigh as to be heard in a loud whisper 
c estbien , returned the sentinel , throwing his musket from the charge to his shoulder 
vous promenez bien matin , monsieur 
il estnecessaire d etre vigilant , mon enfant , the other observed , drpping a fold of his cloak , and looking the soldier close in the face as he passed him , stll continuing his way toward the british fortification 
the man strted 
his arms rattled heavily as he threw them forward in the lowestand mostrespectful salute 
when he had again recovered his piece , he turned to walk his post muttering between his teeth  il faut etre vigilant , en verite 
je crois que nous avons la , un caporal qui ne dort jamais 
the officer proceeded , without affecting to hear the words which escaped the sentinel in his surprise 
nor did he again pause until he had reached the low stand , and in a somewhat dangerous vicinity to the westrn water baston of the fort 
the light of an obscure moon was justsufficient to render objects , though dim , perceptible in their outlines 
he , therefore , took the precaution to place himself againstthe trunk of a tree , where he leaned for many minutes , and seemed to contemplate the dark and silent mounds of the english works in profound attention 
his gaze at the ramparts was not that of a curious or idle spectator 
his looks wandered from point to point , denoting his knowledge of military usages , and betraying that his search was not unaccompanied by distust  at length he appeared satisfied 
having casthis eyes impatiently upward toward the summit of the eastrn mountain , as if anticipating the approach of the morning , he was in the act of turning on his footstps , when a light sound on the nearestangle of the baston caught his ear , and induced him to remain 
justthen a figure was seen to approach the edge of the rampart , where it stod , apparently contemplating in its turn the distnt tents of the french encampment 
its head was then turned toward the east as though equally anxious for the appearance of light , when the form leaned againstthe mound , and seemed to gaze upon the glassy expanse of the waters , which , like a submarine firmament , glittered with its thousand mimic strs 
the melancholy air , the hour , together with the vastframe of the man who thus leaned , musing , againstthe english ramparts , left no doubt as to his person in the mind of the observant spectator 
delicacy , no less than prudence , now urged him to retire 
he had moved cautiously round the body of the tree for that purpose , when another sound drw his attention , and once more arrestd his footstps 
it was a low and almostinaudible movement of the water , and was succeeded by a grating of pebbles one againstthe other 
in a moment he saw a dark form rise , as it were , out of the lake , and stal without further noise to the land , within a few feet of the place where he himself stod 
a rifle next slowly rose between his eyes and the watery mirror 
before it could be discharged his own hand was on the lock 
hugh 
exclaimed the savage , whose treacherous aim was so singularly and so unexpectedly interrupted 
without making any reply , the french officer laid his hand on the shoulder of the indian , and led him in profound silence to a distnce from the spot , where their subsequent dialogue might have proved dangerous , and where it seemed that one of them , at least sought a victim 
throwing open his cloak , so as to expose his uniform and the cross of st  louis which was suspended at his breast montcalm strnly demanded  what means this 
does not my son know that the hatchet is buried between the english and his canadian father 
what can the hurons do 
returned the savage , speaking also , though imperfectly , in the french language 
not a warrior has a scalp , and the pale faces make friends 
ha , le renard subtil 
methinks this is an excess of zeal for a friend who was so late an enemy 
how many suns have set since le renard stuck the warpostof the english 
where is that sun 
demanded the sullen savage 
behind the hill 
it is dark and cold 
when he comes again , it will be bright and warm 
le subtil is the sun of his tribe 
there have been clouds , and many mountains between him and his nation 
now he shines and it is a clear sky 
that le renard has power with his people , i well know , said montcalm 
for yestrday he hunted for their scalps , and today they hear him at the councilfire 
magua is a great chief 
let him prove it , by teaching his nation how to conduct themselves toward our new friends 
why did the chief of the canadas bring his young men into the woods , and fire his cannon at the earthen house 
demanded the subtle indian 
to subdue it 
my mastr owns the land , and your father was ordered to drve off these english squatters 
they have consented to go , and now he calls them enemies no longer 
tis well 
magua took the hatchet to color it with blood 
it is now bright 
when it is red , it shall be buried 
magua is pledged not to sully the lilies of france 
the enemies of the great king across the salt lake are his enemies 
his friends , the friends of the hurons 
friends 
repeated the indian in scorn 
let his father give magua a hand 
montcalm , who felt that his influence over the warlike tribes he had gathered was to be maintained by concession rather than by power , complied reluctantly with the other s request  the savage placed the fingers of the french commander on a deep scar in his bosom , and then exultingly demanded  does my father know that 
what warrior does not 
tis where a leaden bullet has cut 
this 
continued the indian , who had turned his naked back to the other , his body being without its usual calico mantle 
this 
my son has been sadly injured here 
who has done this 
magua slept hard in the english wigwams , and the stcks have left their mark , returned the savage , with a hollow laugh , which did not conceal the fierce temper that nearly choked him 
recollecting himself , with sudden and native dignity , he added  go 
teach your young men it is peace 
le renard subtil knows how to speak to a huron warrior 
without deigning to bestw further words , or to wait for any answer , the savage casthis rifle into the hollow of his arm , and moved silently through the encampment toward the woods where his own tribe was known to lie 
every few yards as he proceeded he was challenged by the sentinels 
he stlked sullenly onward , utterly disregarding the summons of the soldiers , who only spared his life because they knew the air and tread no less than the obstnate daring of an indian 
montcalm lingered long and melancholy on the stand where he had been left by his companion , brooding deeply on the temper which his ungovernable ally had justdiscovered 
already had his fair fame been tarnished by one horrid scene , and in circumstnces fearfully resembling those under which he how found himself 
as he mused he became keenly sensible of the deep responsibility they assume who disregard the means to attain the end , and of all the danger of setting in motion an engine which it exceeds human power to control 
shaking off a train of reflections that he accounted a weakness in such a moment of triumph , he retraced his stps toward his tent , giving the order as he passed to make the signal that should arouse the army from its slumbers 
the firsttap of the french drms was echoed from the bosom of the fort , and presently the valley was filled with the stains of martial music , rising long , thrilling and lively above the rattling accompaniment 
the horns of the victors sounded merry and cheerful flourishes , until the lastlaggard of the camp was at his post but the instnt the british fifes had blown their shrill signal , they became mute 
in the meantime the day had dawned , and when the line of the french army was ready to receive its general , the rays of a brilliant sun were glancing along the glittering array 
that success , which was already so well known , was officially announced 
the favored band who were selected to guard the gates of the fort were detailed , and defiled before their chief 
the signal of their approach was given , and all the usual preparations for a change of mastrs were ordered and executed directly under the guns of the contestd works 
a very different scene presented itself within the lines of the angloamerican army 
as soon as the warning signal was given , it exhibited all the signs of a hurried and forced departure 
the sullen soldiers shouldered their empty tubes and fell into their places , like men whose blood had been heated by the pastcontest and who only desired the opportunity to revenge an indignity which was stll wounding to their pride , concealed as it was under the observances of military etiquette 
women and childrn ran from place to place , some bearing the scanty remnants of their baggage , and others searching in the ranks for those countenances they looked up to for protection 
munro appeared among his silent troops firm but dejected 
it was evident that the unexpected blow had stuck deep into his heart , though he stuggled to sustin his misfortune with the port of a man 
duncan was touched at the quiet and impressive exhibition of his grief 
he had discharged his own duty , and he now pressed to the side of the old man , to know in what particular he might serve him 
my daughters , was the brief but expressive reply 
good heavens 
are not arrangements already made for their convenience 
today i am only a soldier , major heyward , said the veteran 
all that you see here , claim alike to be my childrn 
duncan had heard enough 
without losing one of those moments which had now become so precious , he flew toward the quarters of munro , in questof the sistrs 
he found them on the threshold of the low edifice , already prepared to depart , and surrounded by a clamorous and weeping assemblage of their own sex , that had gathered about the place , with a sort of instnctive consciousness that it was the point mostlikely to be protected 
though the cheeks of cora were pale and her countenance anxious , she had lostnone of her firmness 
the eyes of alice were inflamed , and betrayed how long and bitterly she had wept 
they both , however , received the young man with undisguised pleasure 
the former , for a novelty , being the firstto speak 
the fort is lost she said , with a melancholy smile 
though our good name , i trust remains 
tis brighter than ever 
dearestmiss munro , it is time to think less of others , and to make some provision for yourself 
military usagepridethat pride on which you so much value yourself , demands that your father and i should for a little while continue with the troops 
where to seek a proper protector for you againstthe confusion and chances of such a scene 
none is necessary , returned cora 
who will dare to injure or insult the daughter of such a father , at a time like this 
i would not leave you alone , continued the youth , looking about him in a hurried manner , for the command of the bestregiment in the pay of the king 
remember , our alice is not gifted with all your firmness , and god only knows the terror she might endure 
you may be right , cora replied , smiling again , but far more sadly than before 
listn 
chance has already sent us a friend when he is mostneeded 
duncan did listn , and on the instnt comprehended her meaning 
the low and serious sounds of the sacred music , so well known to the eastrn provinces , caught his ear , and instntly drw him to an apartment in an adjacent building , which had already been deserted by its custmary tenants 
there he found david , pouring out his pious feelings through the only medium in which he ever indulged 
duncan waited , until , by the cessation of the movement of the hand , he believed the stain was ended , when , by touching his shoulder , he drw the attention of the other to himself , and in a few words explained his wishes 
even so , replied the singleminded disciple of the king of israel , when the young man had ended 
i have found much that is comely and melodious in the maidens , and it is fitting that we who have consorted in so much peril , should abide together in peace 
i will attend them , when i have completed my morning praise , to which nothing is now wanting but the doxology 
wilt thou bear a part , friend 
the meter is common , and the tune  southwell  
extending the little volume , and giving the pitch of the air anew with considerate attention , david recommenced and finished his stains , with a fixedness of manner that it was not easy to interrupt 
heyward was fain to wait until the verse was ended 
when , seeing david relieving himself from the spectacles , and replacing the book , he continued 
it will be your duty to see that none dare to approach the ladies with any rude intention , or to offer insult or taunt at the misfortune of their brave father 
in this task you will be seconded by the domestcs of their household 
even so 
it is possible that the indians and stagglers of the enemy may intrude , in which case you will remind them of the terms of the capitulation , and threaten to report their conduct to montcalm 
a word will suffice 
if not , i have that here which shall , returned david , exhibiting his book , with an air in which meekness and confidence were singularly blended 
here are words which , uttered , or rather thundered , with proper emphasis , and in measured time , shall quiet the mostunruly temper   why rage the heathen furiously  
enough , said heyward , interrupting the burstof his musical invocation 
we understnd each other 
it is time that we should now assume our respective duties 
gamut cheerfully assented , and together they sought the females 
cora received her new and somewhat extraordinary protector courteously , at least and even the pallid features of alice lighted again with some of their native archness as she thanked heyward for his care 
duncan took occasion to assure them he had done the bestthat circumstnces permitted , and , as he believed , quite enough for the security of their feelings 
of danger there was none 
he then spoke gladly of his intention to rejoin them the moment he had led the advance a few miles toward the hudson , and immediately took his leave 
by this time the signal for departure had been given , and the head of the english column was in motion 
the sistrs strted at the sound , and glancing their eyes around , they saw the white uniforms of the french grenadiers , who had already taken possession of the gates of the fort 
at that moment an enormous cloud seemed to pass suddenly above their heads , and , looking upward , they discovered that they stod beneath the wide folds of the stndard of france 
let us go , said cora 
this is no longer a fit place for the childrn of an english officer 
alice clung to the arm of her sistr , and together they left the parade , accompanied by the moving throng that surrounded them 
as they passed the gates , the french officers , who had learned their rank , bowed often and low , forbearing , however , to intrude those attentions which they saw , with peculiar tact , might not be agreeable 
as every vehicle and each beastof burden was occupied by the sick and wounded , cora had decided to endure the fatigues of a foot march , rather than interfere with their comforts 
indeed , many a maimed and feeble soldier was compelled to drg his exhaustd limbs in the rear of the columns , for the want of the necessary means of conveyance in that wilderness 
the whole , however , was in motion 
the weak and wounded , groaning and in suffering 
their comrdes silent and sullen 
the women and childrn in terror , they knew not of what 
as the confused and timid throng left the protecting mounds of the fort , and issued on the open plain , the whole scene was at once presented to their eyes 
at a little distnce on the right , and somewhat in the rear , the french army stod to their arms , montcalm having collected his parties , so soon as his guards had possession of the works 
they were attentive but silent observers of the proceedings of the vanquished , failing in none of the stpulated military honors , and offering no taunt or insult , in their success , to their less fortunate foes 
living masses of the english , to the amount , in the whole , of near three thousand , were moving slowly across the plain , toward the common center , and gradually approached each other , as they converged to the point of their march , a vist cut through the lofty trees , where the road to the hudson entered the forest along the sweeping borders of the woods hung a dark cloud of savages , eyeing the passage of their enemies , and hovering at a distnce , like vultures who were only kept from swooping on their prey by the presence and restaint of a superior army 
a few had staggled among the conquered columns , where they stlked in sullen discontent 
attentive , though , as yet , passive observers of the moving multitude 
the advance , with heyward at its head , had already reached the defile , and was slowly disappearing , when the attention of cora was drwn to a collection of stagglers by the sounds of contention 
a truant provincial was paying the forfeit of his disobedience , by being plundered of those very effects which had caused him to desert his place in the ranks 
the man was of powerful frame , and too avaricious to part with his goods without a stuggle 
individuals from either party interfered 
the one side to prevent and the other to aid in the robbery 
voices grew loud and angry , and a hundrd savages appeared , as it were , by magic , where a dozen only had been seen a minute before 
it was then that cora saw the form of magua gliding among his countrymen , and speaking with his fatal and artful eloquence 
the mass of women and childrn stpped , and hovered together like alarmed and fluttering birds 
the cupidity of the indian was soon gratified , and the different bodies again moved slowly onward 
the savages now fell back , and seemed content to let their enemies advance without further molesttion 
as the female crowd approached them , the gaudy colors of a shawl attracted the eyes of a wild and untutored huron 
he advanced to seize it without the leasthesitation 
the woman , more in terror than through love of the ornament , wrapped her child in the coveted article , and folded both more closely to her bosom 
cora was in the act of speaking , with an intent to advise the woman to abandon the trifle , when the savage relinquished his hold of the shawl , and tore the screaming infant from her arms 
abandoning everything to the greedy grasp of those around her , the mother darted , with distaction in her mien , to reclaim her child 
the indian smiled grimly , and extended one hand , in sign of a willingness to exchange , while , with the other , he flourished the babe over his head , holding it by the feet as if to enhance the value of the ransom 
hereherethereallanyeverything 
exclaimed the breathless woman , tearing the lighter articles of drss from her person with illdirected and trembling fingers 
take all , but give me my babe 
the savage spurned the worthless rags , and perceiving that the shawl had already become a prize to another , his bantering but sullen smile changing to a gleam of ferocity , he dashed the head of the infant againsta rock , and castits quivering remains to her very feet 
for an instnt the mother stod , like a sttue of despair , looking wildly down at the unseemly object , which had so lately nested in her bosom and smiled in her face 
then she raised her eyes and countenance toward heaven , as if calling on god to curse the perpetrator of the foul deed 
she was spared the sin of such a prayer for , maddened at his disappointment , and excited at the sight of blood , the huron mercifully drve his tom awk into her own brain 
the mother sank under the blow , and fell , grasping at her child , in death , with the same engrossing love that had caused her to cherish it when living 
at that dangerous moment , magua placed his hands to his mouth , and raised the fatal and appalling whoop 
the scattered indians strted at the wellknown cry , as coursers bound at the signal to quit the goal 
directly there arose such a yell along the plain , and through the arches of the wood , as seldom burstfrom human lips before 
they who heard it listned with a curdling horror at the heart , little inferior to that drad which may be expected to attend the blast of the final summons 
more than two thousand raving savages broke from the forestat the signal , and threw themselves across the fatal plain with instnctive alacrity 
we shall not dwell on the revolting horrors that succeeded 
death was everywhere , and in his mostterrific and disgustng aspects 
resistnce only served to inflame the murderers , who inflicted their furious blows long after their victims were beyond the power of their resentment 
the flow of blood might be likened to the outbreaking of a torrent 
as the natives became heated and maddened by the sight , many among them even kneeled to the earth , and drnk freely , exultingly , hellishly , of the crimson tide 
the trained bodies of the troops threw themselves quickly into solid masses , endeavoring to awe their assailants by the imposing appearance of a military front 
the experiment in some measure succeeded , though far too many suffered their unloaded muskets to be torn from their hands , in the vain hope of appeasing the savages 
in such a scene none had leisure to note the fleeting moments 
it might have been ten minutes  , and bring in the tidings to edward 
the scout , remembering only his own strdy and iron nature , had probably exacted a task that david , under no circumstnces , could have performed 
without entirely losing the meekness of his air , the latter was content to answer  though my soul would rejoice to visit the habitations of christndom once more , my feet would rather follow the tender spirits intrustd to my keeping , even into the idolatrous province of the jesuits , than take one stp backward , while they pined in captivity and sorrow 
though the figurative language of david was not very intelligible , the sincere and stady expression of his eye , and the glow of his honestcountenance , were not easily mistken 
uncas pressed closer to his side , and regarded the speaker with a look of commendation , while his father expressed his satisfaction by the ordinary pithy exclamation of approbation 
the scout shook his head as he rejoined  the lord never intended that the man should place all his endeavors in his throat , to the neglect of other and better gifts 
he has fallen into the hands of some silly woman , when he should have been gathering his education under a blue sky , among the beauties of the forest  here , friend 
i did intend to kindle a fire with this tooting whiste of thine 
as you value the thing , take it , and blow your beston it 
gamut received his pitchpipe with as stong an expression of pleasure as he believed compatible with the grave functions he exercised 
after essaying its virtues repeatedly , in contrastwith his own voice , and , satisfying himself that none of its melody was lost he made a very serious demonstation toward achieving a few stnzas of one of the longesteffusions in the little volume so often mentioned 
heyward , however , hastly interrupted his pious purpose by continuing questons concerning the pastand present condition of his fellow captives , and in a manner more methodical than had been permitted by his feelings in the opening of their interview 
david , though he regarded his treasure with longing eyes , was constained to answer , especially as the venerable father took a part in the interrogatories , with an interesttoo imposing to be denied 
nor did the scout fail to throw in a pertinent inquiry , whenever a fitting occasion presented 
in this manner , though with frequent interruptions which were filled with certain threatening sounds from the recovered instument , the pursuers were put in possession of such leading circumstnces as were likely to prove useful in accomplishing their great and engrossing objectthe recovery of the sistrs 
the narrative of david was simple , and the facts but few 
magua had waited on the mountain until a safe moment to retire presented itself , when he had descended , and taken the route along the westrn side of the horican in direction of the canadas 
as the subtle huron was familiar with the paths , and well knew there was no immediate danger of pursuit , their progress had been moderate , and far from fatiguing 
it appeared from the unembellished sttement of david , that his own presence had been rather endured than desired 
though even magua had not been entirely exempt from that veneration with which the indians regard those whom the great spirit had visited in their intellects 
at night , the utmostcare had been taken of the captives , both to prevent injury from the damps of the woods and to guard againstan escape 
at the spring , the horses were turned loose , as has been seen 
notwithstnding the remoteness and length of their trail , the artifices already named were resorted to , in order to cut off every clue to their place of retreat 
on their arrival at the encampment of his people , magua , in obedience to a policy seldom departed from , separated his prisoners 
cora had been sent to a tribe that temporarily occupied an adjacent valley , though david was far too ignorant of the custms and histry of the natives , to be able to declare anything satisfactory concerning their name or character 
he only knew that they had not engaged in the late expedition againstwilliam henry 
that , like the hurons themselves they were allies of montcalm 
that they maintained an amicable , though a watchful intercourse with the warlike and savage people whom chance had , for a time , brought in such close and disagreeable contact with themselves 
the mohicans and the scout listned to his interrupted and imperfect narrative , with an interestthat obviously increased as he proceeded 
it was while attempting to explain the pursuits of the community in which cora was detained , that the latter abruptly demanded  did you see the fashion of their knives 
wee they of english or french formation 
my thoughts were bent on no such vanities , but rather mingled in consolation with those of the maidens 
the time may come when you will not consider the knife of a savage such a despicable vanity , returned the scout , with a stong expression of contempt for the other s dullness 
had they held their corn feastr can you say anything of the totems of the tribe 
of corn , we had many and plentiful feast 
for the grain , being in the milk is both sweet to the mouth and comfortable to the stmach 
of totem , i know not the meaning 
if it appertaineth in any wise to the art of indian music , it need not be inquired after at their hands 
they never join their voices in praise , and it would seem that they are among the profanestof the idolatrous 
therein you belie the natur  of an indian 
even the mingo adores but the true and loving god 
tis wicked fabrication of the whites , and i say it to the shame of my color that would make the warrior bow down before images of his own creation 
it is true , they endeavor to make truces to the wicked oneas who would not with an enemy he cannot conquer 
they look up for favor and assistnce to the great and good spirit only 
it may be so , said david 
i have seen stange and fantastc images drwn in their paint , of which their admiration and care savored of spiritual pride 
especially one , and that , too , a foul and loathsome object 
was it a sarpent 
quickly demanded the scout 
much the same 
it was in the likeness of an abject and creeping tortoise 
hugh 
exclaimed both the attentive mohicans in a breath 
while the scout shook his head with the air of one who had made an important but by no means a pleasing discovery 
the father spoke , in the language of the delawares , and with a calmness and dignity that instntly arrestd the attention even of those to whom his words were unintelligible 
his gestres were impressive , and at times energetic 
once he lifted his arm on high 
as it descended , the action threw aside the folds of his light mantle , a finger restng on his breast as if he would enforce his meaning by the attitude 
duncan s eyes followed the movement , and he perceived that the animal justmentioned was beautifully , though faintly , worked in blue tint , on the swarthy breastof the chief 
all that he had ever heard of the violent separation of the vasttribes of the delawares rushed across his mind , and he awaited the proper moment to speak , with a suspense that was rendered nearly intolerable by his interestin the stke 
his wish , however , was anticipated by the scout who turned from his red friend , saying  we have found that which may be good or evil to us , as heaven disposes 
the sagamore is of the high blood of the delawares , and is the great chief of their tortoises 
that some of this stck are among the people of whom the singer tells us , is plain by his words 
had he but spent half the breath in prudent questons that he has blown away in making a trumpet of his throat , we might have known how many warriors they numbered 
it is , altogether , a dangerous path we move in 
for a friend whose face is turned from you often bears a bloodier mind than the enemy who seeks your scalp 
explain , said duncan 
tis a long and melancholy tradition , and one i little like to think of 
for it is not to be denied that the evil has been mainly done by men with white skins 
it has ended in turning the tom awk of brother againstbrother , and brought the mingo and the delaware to travel in the same path 
you , then , suspect it is a portion of that people among whom cora resides 
the scout nodded his head in assent , though he seemed anxious to waive the further discussion of a subject that appeared painful 
the impatient duncan now made several hast and desperate propositions to attempt the release of the sistrs 
munro seemed to shake off his apathy , and listned to the wild schemes of the young man with a deference that his gray hairs and reverend years should have denied 
the scout , after suffering the ardor of the lover to expend itself a little , found means to convince him of the folly of precipitation , in a manner that would require their coolestjudgment and utmostfortitude 
it would be well , he added , to let this man go in again , as usual , and for him to tarry in the lodges , giving notice to the gentle ones of our approach , until we call him out , by signal , to consult 
you know the cry of a crow , friend , from the whiste of the whippoorwill 
tis a pleasing bird , returned david , and has a soft and melancholy note 
though the time is rather quick and ill measured 
he speaks of the wishtonwish , said the scout 
well , since you like his whiste , it shall be your signal 
remember , then , when you hear the whippoorwill s call three times repeated , you are to come into the bushes where the bird might be supposed stp , interrupted heyward 
i will accompany him 
you 
exclaimed the astnished hawkeye 
are you tired of seeing the sun rise and set 
david is a living proof that the hurons can be merciful 
ay , but david can use his throat , as no man in his senses would pervart the gift 
i too can play the madman , the fool , the hero 
in short , any or everything to rescue her i love 
name your objections no longer  i am resolved 
hawkeye regarded the young man a moment in speechless amazement 
duncan , who , in deference to the other s skill and services , had hitherto submitted somewhat implicitly to his dictation , now assumed the superior , with a manner that was not easily resistd 
he waved his hand , in sign of his dislike to all remonstance , and then , in more tempered language , he continued  you have the means of disguise 
change me 
paint me , too , if you will 
in short , alter me to anythinga fool 
it is not for one like me to say that he who is already formed by so powerful a hand as providence , stnds in need of a change , muttered the discontented scout 
when you send your parties abroad in war , you find it prudent , at least to arrange the marks and places of encampment , in order that they who fight on your side may know when and where to expect a friend 
listn , interrupted duncan 
you have heard from this faithful follower of the captives , that the indians are of two tribes , if not of different nations 
with one , whom you think to be a branch of the delawares , is she you call the  wouldarkhair  
the other , and younger , of the ladies , is undeniably with our declared enemies , the hurons 
it becomes my youth and rank to attempt the latter adventure 
while you , therefore , are negotiating with your friends for the release of one of the sistrs , i will effect that of the other , or die 
the awakened spirit of the young soldier gleamed in his eyes , and his form became imposing under its influence 
hawkeye , though too much accustmed to indian artifices not to foresee the danger of the experiment , knew not well how to combat this sudden resolution 
perhaps there was something in the proposal that suited his own hardy nature , and that secret love of desperate adventure , which had increased with his experience , until hazard and danger had become , in some measure , necessary to the enjoyment of his existnce 
instad of continuing to oppose the scheme of duncan , his humor suddenly altered , and he lent himself to its execution 
come , he said , with a goodhumored smile 
the buck that will take to the water mustbe headed , and not followed 
chingachgook has as many different paints as the engineer officer s wife , who takes down natur  on scraps of paper , making the mountains look like cocks of rust hay , and placing the blue sky in reach of your hand 
the sagamore can use them , too 
seat yourself on the log 
my life on it , he can soon make a natural fool of you , and that well to your liking 
duncan complied 
the mohican , who had been an attentive listner to the discourse , readily undertook the office 
long practised in all the subtle arts of his race , he drw , with great dexterity and quickness , the fantastc shadow that the natives were accustmed to consider as the evidence of a friendly and jocular disposition 
every line that could possibly be interpreted into a secret inclination for war , was carefully avoided 
while , on the other hand , he stdied those conceits that might be constued into amity 
in short , he entirely sacrificed every appearance of the warrior to the masquerade of a buffoon 
such exhibitions were not uncommon among the indians , and as duncan was already sufficiently disguised in his drss , there certainly did existsome reason for believing that , with his knowledge of french , he might pass for a juggler from ticonderoga , staggling among the allied and friendly tribes 
when he was thought to be sufficiently painted , the scout gave him much friendly advice 
concerted signals , and appointed the place where they should meet , in the event of mutual success 
the parting between munro and his young friend was more melancholy 
stll , the former submitted to the separation with an indifference that his warm and honestnature would never have permitted in a more healthful stte of mind 
the scout led heyward aside , and acquainted him with his intention to leave the veteran in some safe encampment , in charge of chingachgook , while he and uncas pursued their inquires among the people they had reason to believe were delawares 
renewing his cautions and advice , he concluded by saying , with a solemnity and warmth of feeling , with which duncan was deeply touched  and , now , god bless you 
you have shown a spirit that i like 
for it is the gift of youth , more especially one of warm blood and a stut heart 
believe the warning of a man who has reason to know all he says to be true 
you will have occasion for your bestmanhood , and for a sharper wit than what is to be gathered in books , afore you outdo the cunning or get the better of the courage of a mingo 
god bless you 
if the hurons mastr your scalp , rely on the promise of one who has two stut warriors to back him 
they shall pay for their victory , with a life for every hair it holds 
i say , young gentleman , may providence bless your undertaking , which is altogether for good 
remember , that to outwit the knaves it is lawful to practise things that may not be naturally the gift of a whiteskin 
duncan shook his worthy and reluctant associate warmly by the hand , once more recommended his aged friend to his care , and returning his good wishes , he motioned to david to proceed 
hawkeye gazed after the highspirited and adventurous young man for several moments , in open admiration 
shaking his head doubtingly , he turned , and led his own division of the party into the concealment of the forest the route taken by duncan and david lay directly across the clearing of the beavers , and along the margin of their pond 
when the former found himself alone with one so simple , and so little qualified to render any assistnce in desperate emergencies , he firstbegan to be sensible of the difficulties of the task he had undertaken 
the fading light increased the gloominess of the bleak and savage wilderness that stetched so far on every side of him , and there was even a fearful character in the stllness of those little huts , that he knew were so abundantly peopled 
it stuck him , as he gazed at the admirable stuctures and the wonderful precautions of their sagacious inmates , that even the brutes of these vastwilds were possessed of an instnct nearly commensurate with his own reason 
he could not reflect , without anxiety , on the unequal contestthat he had so rashly courted 
came the glowing image of alice 
her distess 
her actual danger 
all the peril of his situation was forgotten 
cheering david , he moved on with the light and vigorous stp of youth and enterprise 
after making nearly a semicircle around the pond , they diverged from the watercourse , and began to ascend to the level of a slight elevation in that bottom land , over which they journeyed 
within half an hour they gained the margin of another opening that bore all the signs of having been also made by the beavers , and which those sagacious animals had probably been induced , by some accident , to abandon , for the more eligible position they now occupied 
a very natural sensation caused duncan to hesitate a moment , unwilling to leave the cover of their bushy path , as a man pauses to collect his energies before he essays any hazardous experiment , in which he is secretly conscious they will all be needed 
he profited by the halt , to gather such information as might be obtained from his short and hast glances 
on the opposite side of the clearing , and near the point where the brook tumbled over some rocks , from a stll higher level , some fifty or sixty lodges , rudely fabricated of logs brush , and earth intermingled , were to be discovered 
they were arranged without any order , and seemed to be constucted with very little attention to neatness or beauty 
indeed , so very inferior were they in the two latter particulars to the village duncan had justseen , that he began to expect a second surprise , no less astnishing that the former 
this expectation was is no degree diminished , when , by the doubtful twilight , he beheld twenty or thirty forms rising alternately from the cover of the tall , coarse grass , in front of the lodges , and then sinking again from the sight , as it were to burrow in the earth 
by the sudden and hast glimpses that he caught of these figures , they seemed more like dark , glancing specters , or some other unearthly beings , than creatures fashioned with the ordinary and vulgar materials of flesh and blood 
a gaunt , naked form was seen , for a single instnt , tossing its arms wildly in the air , and then the spot it had filled was vacant 
the figure appearing suddenly in some other and distnt place , or being succeeded by another , possessing the same mystrious character 
david , observing that his companion lingered , pursued the direction of his gaze , and in some measure recalled the recollection of heyward , by speaking 
there is much fruitful soil uncultivated here , he said 
i may add , without the sinful leaven of self commendation , that , since my short sojourn in these heathenish abodes , much good seed has been scattered by the wayside 
the tribes are fonder of the chase than of the arts of men of labor , returned the unconscious duncan , stll gazing at the objects of his wonder 
it is rather joy than labor to the spirit , to lift up the voice in praise 
sadly do these boys abuse their gifts 
rarely have i found any of their age , on whom nature has so freely bestwed the elements of psalmody 
surely , surely , there are none who neglect them more 
three nights have i now tarried here , and three several times have i assembled the urchins to join in sacred song 
as often have they responded to my efforts with whoopings and howlings that have chilled my soul 
of whom speak you 
of those childrn of the devil , who wast the precious moments in yonder idle antics 

the wholesome restaint of discipline is but little known among this selfabandoned people 
in a country of birches , a rod is never seen , and it ought not to appear a marvel in my eyes , that the choicestblessings of providence are wastd in such cries as these 
david closed his ears againstthe juvenile pack , whose yell justthen rang shrilly through the forest and duncan , suffering his lip to curl , as in mockery of his own supersttion , said firmly  we will proceed 
without removing the safeguards form his ears , the mastr of song complied , and together they pursued their way toward what david was sometimes wont to call the tents of the philistnes 
chapter 23 but though the beastof game the privilege of chase may claim 
though space and law the stg we lend ere hound we slip , or bow we bend 
whoever recked , where , how , or when the prowling fox was trapped or slain 
lady of the lake it is unusual to find an encampment of the natives , like those of the more instucted whites , guarded by the presence of armed men 
well informed of the approach of every danger , while it is yet at a distnce , the indian generally rest secure under his knowledge of the signs of the forest and the long and difficult paths that separate him from those he has mostreason to drad 
the enemy who , by any lucky concurrence of accidents , has found means to elude the vigilance of the scouts , will seldom meet with sentinels nearer home to sound the alarm 
in addition to this general usage , the tribes friendly to the french knew too well the weight of the blow that had justbeen stuck , to apprehend any immediate danger from the hostle nations that were tributary to the crown of britain 
when duncan and david , therefore , found themselves in the center of the childrn , who played the antics already mentioned , it was without the leastprevious intimation of their approach 
so soon as they were observed the whole of the juvenile pack raised , by common consent , a shrill and warning whoop 
then sank , as it were , by magic , from before the sight of their visitors 
the naked , tawny bodies of the crouching urchins blended so nicely at that hour , with the withered herbage , that at firstit seemed as if the earth had , in truth , swallowed up their forms 
though when surprise permitted duncan to bend his look more curiously about the spot , he found it everywhere met by dark , quick , and rolling eyeballs 
gathering no encouragement from this strtling presage of the nature of the scrutiny he was likely to undergo from the more mature judgments of the men , there was an instnt when the young soldier would have retreated 
it was , however , too late to appear to hesitate 
the cry of the childrn had drwn a dozen warriors to the door of the nearestlodge , where they stod clustred in a dark and savage group , gravely awaiting the nearer approach of those who had unexpectedly come among them 
david , in some measure familiarized to the scene , led the way with a stadiness that no slight obstcle was likely to disconcert , into this very building 
it was the principal edifice of the village , though roughly constucted of the bark and branches of trees 
being the lodge in which the tribe held its councils and public meetings during their temporary residence on the borders of the english province 
duncan found it difficult to assume the necessary appearance of unconcern , as he brushed the dark and powerful frames of the savages who thronged its threshold 
conscious that his existnce depended on his presence of mind , he trustd to the discretion of his companion , whose footstps he closely followed , endeavoring , as he proceeded , to rally his thoughts for the occasion 
his blood curdled when he found himself in absolute contact with such fierce and implacable enemies 
he so far mastred his feelings as to pursue his way into the center of the lodge , with an exterior that did not betray the weakness 
imitating the example of the deliberate gamut , he drw a bundle of fragrant brush from beneath a pile that filled the corner of the hut , and seated himself in silence 
soon as their visitor had passed , the observant warriors fell back from the entrance , and arranging themselves about him , they seemed patiently to await the moment when it might comport with the dignity of the stanger to speak 
by far the greater number stod leaning , in lazy , lounging attitudes , againstthe upright post that supported the crazy building , while three or four of the oldestand mostdistnguished of the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a little more in advance 
a flaring torch was burning in the place , and set its red glare from face to face and figure to figure , as it waved in the currents of air 
duncan profited by its light to read the probable character of his reception , in the countenances of his host 
his ingenuity availed him little , againstthe cold artifices of the people he had encountered 
the chiefs in front scarce casta glance at his person , keeping their eyes on the ground , with an air that might have been intended for respect , but which it was quite easy to constue into distust  the men in the shadow were less reserved 
duncan soon detected their searching , but stlen , looks which , in truth , scanned his person and attire inch by inch 
leaving no emotion of the countenance , no gestre , no line of the paint , nor even the fashion of a garment , unheeded , and without comment 
at length one whose hair was beginning to be sprinkled with gray , but whose sinewy limbs and firm tread announced that he was stll equal to the duties of manhood , advanced out of the gloom of a corner , whither he had probably postd himself to make his observations unseen , and spoke 
he used the language of the wyandots , or hurons 
his words were , consequently , unintelligible to heyward , though they seemed , by the gestres that accompanied them , to be uttered more in courtesy than anger 
the latter shook his head , and made a gestre indicative of his inability to reply 
do none of my brothers speak the french or the english 
he said , in the former language , looking about him from countenance to countenance , in hopes of finding a nod of assent 
though more than one had turned , as if to catch the meaning of his words , they remained unanswered 
i should be grieved to think , continued duncan , speaking slowly , and using the simplestfrench of which he was the mastr , to believe that none of this wise and brave nation understnd the language that the grand monarque  uses when he talks to his childrn 
his heart would be heavy did he believe his red warriors paid him so little respect 
a long and grave pause succeeded , during which no movement of a limb , nor any expression of an eye , betrayed the expression produced by his remark 
duncan , who knew that silence was a virtue among his host , gladly had recourse to the custm , in order to arrange his ideas 
at length the same warrior who had before addrssed him replied , by drly demanding , in the language of the canadas  when our great father speaks to his people , is it with the tongue of a huron 
he knows no difference in his childrn , whether the color of the skin be red , or black , or white , returned duncan , evasively 
though chiefly is he satisfied with the brave hurons 
in what manner will he speak , demanded the wary chief , when the runners count to him the scalps which five nights ago grew on the heads of the yengeese 
they were his enemies , said duncan , shuddering involuntarily 
doubtless , he will say , it is good 
my hurons are very gallant 
our canada father does not think it 
instad of looking forward to reward his indians , his eyes are turned backward 
he sees the dead yengeese , but no huron 
what can this mean 
a great chief , like him , has more thoughts than tongues 
he looks to see that no enemies are on his trail 
the canoe of a dead warrior will not float on the horican , returned the savage , gloomily 
his ears are open to the delawares , who are not our friends , and they fill them with lies 
it cannot be 
see 
he has bid me , who am a man that knows the art of healing , to go to his childrn , the red hurons of the great lakes , and ask if any are sick 
another silence succeeded this annunciation of the character duncan had assumed 
every eye was simultaneously bent on his person , as if to inquire into the truth or falsehood of the declaration , with an intelligence and keenness that caused the subject of their scrutiny to tremble for the result 
he was , however , relieved again by the former speaker 
do the cunning men of the canadas paint their skins 
the huron coldly continued 
we have heard them boastthat their faces were pale 
when an indian chief comes among his white fathers , returned duncan , with great stadiness , he lays aside his buffalo robe , to carry the shirt that is offered him 
my brothers have given me paint and i wear it 
a low murmur of applause announced that the compliment of the tribe was favorably received 
the elderly chief made a gestre of commendation , which was answered by mostof his companions , who each threw forth a hand and uttered a brief exclamation of pleasure 
duncan began to breathe more freely , believing that the weight of his examination was past and , as he had already prepared a simple and probable tale to support his pretended occupation , his hopes of ultimate success grew brighter 
after a silence of a few moments , as if adjustng his thoughts , in order to make a suitable answer to the declaration their guest had justgiven , another warrior arose , and placed himself in an attitude to speak 
while his lips were yet in the act of parting , a low but fearful sound arose from the forest and was immediately succeeded by a high , shrill yell , that was drwn out , until it equaled the longestand mostplaintive howl of the wolf 
the sudden and terrible interruption caused duncan to strt from his seat , unconscious of everything but the effect produced by so frightful a cry 
at the same moment , the warriors glided in a body from the lodge , and the outer air was filled with loud shouts , that nearly drwned those awful sounds , which were stll ringing beneath the arches of the woods 
unable to command himself any longer , the youth broke from the place , and presently stod in the center of a disorderly throng , that included nearly everything having life , within the limits of the encampment 
men , women , and childrn 
the aged , the inform , the active , and the stong , were alike abroad , some exclaiming aloud , others clapping their hands with a joy that seemed frantic , and all expressing their savage pleasure in some unexpected event 
though astunded , at first by the uproar , heyward was soon enabled to find its solution by the scene that followed 
there yet lingered sufficient light in the heavens to exhibit those bright openings among the treetops , where different paths left the clearing to enter the depths of the wilderness 
beneath one of them , a line of warriors issued from the woods , and advanced slowly toward the dwellings 
one in front bore a short pole , on which , as it afterwards appeared , were suspended several human scalps 
the strtling sounds that duncan had heard were what the whites have not inappropriately called the deathhallo 
each repetition of the cry was intended to announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy 
thus far the knowledge of heyward assistd him in the explanation 
as he now knew that the interruption was caused by the unlookedfor return of a successful warparty , every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward congratulation , for the opportune relief and insignificance it conferred on himself 
when at the distnce of a few hundrd feet from the lodges the newly arrived warriors halted 
their plaintive and terrific cry , which was intended to represent equally the wailings of the dead and the triumph to the victors , had entirely ceased 
one of their number now called aloud , in words that were far from appalling , though not more intelligible to those for whose ears they were intended , than their expressive yells 
it would be difficult to convey a suitable idea of the savage ecstsy with which the news thus imparted was received 
the whole encampment , in a moment , became a scene of the mostviolent buste and commotion 
the warriors drw their knives , and flourishing them , they arranged themselves in two lines , forming a lane that extended from the warparty to the lodges 
the squaws seized clubs , axes , or whatever weapon of offense firstoffered itself to their hands , and rushed eagerly to act their part in the cruel game that was at hand 
even the childrn would not be excluded 
boys , little able to wield the instuments , tore the tom awks from the belts of their fathers , and stle into the ranks , apt imitators of the savage traits exhibited by their parents 
large piles of brush lay scattered about the clearing , and a wary and aged squaw was occupied in firing as many as might serve to light the coming exhibition 
as the flame arose , its power exceeded that of the parting day , and assistd to render objects at the same time more distnct and more hideous 
the whole scene formed a stiking picture , whose frame was composed of the dark and tall border of pines 
the warriors justarrived were the mostdistnt figures 
a little in advance stod two men , who were apparently selected from the rest as the principal actors in what was to follow 
the light was not stong enough to render their features distnct , though it was quite evident that they were governed by very different emotions 
while one stod erect and firm , prepared to meet his fate like a hero , the other bowed his head , as if palsied by terror or sticken with shame 
the highspirited duncan felt a powerful impulse of admiration and pity toward the former , though no opportunity could offer to exhibit his generous emotions 
he watched his slightestmovement , however , with eager eyes 
as he traced the fine outline of his admirably proportioned and active frame , he endeavored to persuade himself , that , if the powers of man , seconded by such noble resolution , could bear one harmless through so severe a trial , the youthful captive before him might hope for success in the hazardous race he was about to run 
insensibly the young man drw nigher to the swarthy lines of the hurons , and scarcely breathed , so intense became his interestin the spectacle 
justthen the signal yell was given , and the momentary quiet which had preceded it was broken by a burstof cries , that far exceeded any before heard 
the more abject of the two victims continued motionless 
the other bounded from the place at the cry , with the activity and swiftness of a deer 
instad of rushing through the hostle lines , as had been expected , he justentered the dangerous defile , and before time was given for a single blow , turned short , and leaping the heads of a row of childrn , he gained at once the exterior and safer side of the formidable array 
the artifice was answered by a hundrd voices raised in imprecations 
the whole of the excited multitude broke from their order , and spread themselves about the place in wild confusion 
a dozen blazing piles now shed their lurid brightness on the place , which resembled some unhallowed and supernatural arena , in which malicious demons had assembled to act their bloody and lawless rites 
the forms in the background looked like unearthly beings , gliding before the eye , and cleaving the air with frantic and unmeaning gestres 
while the savage passions of such as passed the flames were rendered fearfully distnct by the gleams that shot athwart their inflamed visages 
it will easily be understod that , amid such a concourse of vindictive enemies , no breathing time was allowed the fugitive 
there was a single moment when it seemed as if he would have reached the forest but the whole body of his captors threw themselves before him , and drve him back into the center of his relentless persecutors 
turning like a headed deer , he shot , with the swiftness of an arrow , through a pillar of forked flame , and passing the whole multitude harmless , he appeared on the opposite side of the clearing 
here , too , he was met and turned by a few of the older and more subtle of the hurons 
once more he tried the throng , as if seeking safety in its blindness , and then several moments succeeded , during which duncan believed the active and courageous young stanger was lost nothing could be distnguished but a dark mass of human forms tossed and involved in inexplicable confusion 
arms , gleaming knives , and formidable clubs , appeared above them , but the blows were evidently given at random 
the awful effect was heightened by the piercing shrieks of the women and the fierce yells of the warriors 
now and then duncan caught a glimpse of a light form cleaving the air in some desperate bound , and he rather hoped than believed that the captive yet retained the command of his astnishing powers of activity 
suddenly the multitude rolled backward , and approached the spot where he himself stod 
the heavy body in the rear pressed upon the women and childrn in front , and bore them to the earth 
the stanger reappeared in the confusion 
human power could not , however , much longer endure so severe a trial 
of this the captive seemed conscious 
profiting by the momentary opening , he darted from among the warriors , and made a desperate , and what seemed to duncan a final effort to gain the wood 
as if aware that no danger was to be apprehended from the young soldier , the fugitive nearly brushed his person in his flight 
a tall and powerful huron , who had husbanded his forces , pressed close upon his heels , and with an uplifted arm menaced a fatal blow 
duncan thrustforth a foot , and the shock precipitated the eager savage headlong , many feet in advance of his intended victim 
thought itself is not quicker than was the motion with which the latter profited by the advantage 
he turned , gleamed like a meteor again before the eyes of duncan , and , at the next moment , when the latter recovered his recollection , and gazed around in questof the captive , he saw him quietly leaning againsta small painted post which stod before the door of the principal lodge 
apprehensive that the part he had taken in the escape might prove fatal to himself , duncan left the place without delay 
he followed the crowd , which drw nigh the lodges , gloomy and sullen , like any other multitude that had been disappointed in an execution 
curiosity , or perhaps a better feeling , induced him to approach the stanger 
he found him , stnding with one arm castabout the protecting post and breathing thick and hard , after his exertions , but disdaining to permit a single sign of suffering to escape 
his person was now protected by immemorial and sacred usage , until the tribe in council had deliberated and determined on his fate 
it was not difficult , however , to foretell the result , if any presage could be drwn from the feelings of those who crowded the place 
there was no term of abuse known to the huron vocabulary that the disappointed women did not lavishly expend on the successful stanger 
they flouted at his efforts , and told him , with bitter scoffs , that his feet were better than his hands 
that he merited wings , while he knew not the use of an arrow or a knife 
to all this the captive made no reply 
was content to preserve an attitude in which dignity was singularly blended with disdain 
exasperated as much by his composure as by his goodfortune , their words became unintelligible , and were succeeded by shrill , piercing yells 
justthen the crafty squaw , who had taken the necessary precaution to fire the piles , made her way through the throng , and cleared a place for herself in front of the captive 
the squalid and withered person of this hag might well have obtained for her the character of possessing more than human cunning 
throwing back her light vestent , she stetched forth her long , skinny arm , in derision , and using the language of the lenape , as more intelligible to the subject of her gibes , she commenced aloud  look you , delaware , she said , snapping her fingers in his face 
your nation is a race of women , and the hoe is better fitted to your hands than the gun 
your squaws are the mothers of deer 
if a bear , or a wildcat , or a serpent were born among you , ye would flee 
the huron girls shall make you petticoats , and we will find you a husband 
a burstof savage laughter succeeded this attack , during which the soft and musical merriment of the younger females stangely chimed with the cracked voice of their older and more malignant companion 
the stanger was superior to all their efforts 
his head was immovable 
nor did he betray the slightestconsciousness that any were present , except when his haughty eye rolled toward the dusky forms of the warriors , who stlked in the background silent and sullen observers of the scene 
infuriated at the selfcommand of the captive , the woman placed her arms akimbo 
throwing herself into a postre of defiance , she broke out anew , in a torrent of words that no art of ours could commit successfully to paper 
her breath was , however , expended in vain 
for , although distnguished in her nation as a proficient in the art of abuse , she was permitted to work herself into such a fury as actually to foam at the mouth , without causing a muscle to vibrate in the motionless figure of the stanger 
the effect of his indifference began to extend itself to the other spectators 
a youngstr , who was justquitting the condition of a boy to enter the stte of manhood , attempted to assistthe termagant , by flourishing his tom awk before their victim , and adding his empty boast to the taunts of the women 
indeed , the captive turned his face toward the light , and looked down on the stipling with an expression that was superior to contempt 
at the next moment he resumed his quiet and reclining attitude againstthe post  but the change of postre had permitted duncan to exchange glances with the firm and piercing eyes of uncas 
breathless with amazement , and heavily oppressed with the critical situation of his friend , heyward recoiled before the look , trembling lestits meaning might , in some unknown manner , hastn the prisoner s fate 
there was not , however , any instnt cause for such an apprehension 
justthen a warrior forced his way into the exasperated crowd 
motioning the women and childrn aside with a strn gestre , he took uncas by the arm , and led him toward the door of the councillodge 
thither all the chiefs , and mostof the distnguished warriors , followed 
among whom the anxious heyward found means to enter without attracting any dangerous attention to himself 
a few minutes were consumed in disposing of those present in a manner suitable to their rank and influence in the tribe 
an order very similar to that adopted in the preceding interview was observed 
the aged and superior chiefs occupying the area of the spacious apartment , within the powerful light of a glaring torch , while their juniors and inferiors were arranged in the background , presenting a dark outline of swarthy and marked visages 
in the very center of the lodge , immediately under an opening that admitted the twinkling light of one or two strs , stod uncas , calm , elevated , and collected 
his high and haughty carriage was not loston his captors , who often bent their looks on his person , with eyes which , while they lostnone of their inflexibility of purpose , plainly betrayed their admiration of the stanger s daring 
the case was different with the individual whom duncan had observed to stnd forth with his friend , previously to the desperate trial of speed 
who , instad of joining in the chase , had remained , throughout its turbulent uproar , like a cringing sttue , expressive of shame and disgrace 
though not a hand had been extended to greet him , nor yet an eye had condescended to watch his movements , he had also entered the lodge , as though impelled by a fate to whose decrees he submitted , seemingly , without a stuggle 
heyward profited by the firstopportunity to gaze in his face , secretly apprehensive he might find the features of another acquaintance 
they proved to be those of a stanger , and , what was stll more inexplicable , of one who bore all the distnctive marks of a huron warrior 
instad of mingling with his tribe , however , he sat apart , a solitary being in a multitude , his form shrinking into a crouching and abject attitude , as if anxious to fill as little space as possible 
when each individual had taken his proper sttion , and silence reigned in the place , the grayhaired chief already introduced to the reader , spoke aloud , in the language of the lenni lenape 
delaware , he said , though one of a nation of women , you have proved yourself a man 
i would give you food 
he who eats with a huron should become his friend 
restin peace till the morning sun , when our lastwords shall be spoken 
seven nights , and as many summer days , have i fastd on the trail of the hurons , uncas coldly replied 
the childrn of the lenape know how to travel the path of the justwithout lingering to eat 
two of my young men are in pursuit of your companion , resumed the other , without appearing to regard the boastof his captive 
when they get back , then will our wise man say to you  live  or  wouldie  
has a huron no ears 
scornfully exclaimed uncas 
twice , since he has been your prisoner , has the delaware heard a gun that he knows 
your young men will never come back 
a short and sullen pause succeeded this bold assertion 
duncan , who understod the mohican to allude to the fatal rifle of the scout , bent forward in earnestobservation of the effect it might produce on the conquerors 
the chief was content with simply retorting  if the lenape are so skillful , why is one of their bravestwarriors here 
he followed in the stps of a flying coward , and fell into a snare 
the cunning beaver may be caught 
as uncas thus replied , he pointed with his finger toward the solitary huron , but without deigning to bestw any other notice on so unworthy an object 
the words of the answer and the air of the speaker produced a stong sensation among his auditors 
every eye rolled sullenly toward the individual indicated by the simple gestre , and a low , threatening murmur passed through the crowd 
the ominous sounds reached the outer door , and the women and childrn pressing into the throng , no gap had been left , between shoulder and shoulder , that was not now filled with the dark lineaments of some eager and curious human countenance 
in the meantime , the more aged chiefs , in the center , communed with each other in short and broken sentences 
not a word was uttered that did not convey the meaning of the speaker , in the simplestand mostenergetic form 
again , a long and deeply solemn pause took place 
it was known , by all present , to be the brave precursor of a weighty and important judgment 
they who composed the outer circle of faces were on tiptoe to gaze 
even the culprit for an instnt forgot his shame in a deeper emotion , and exposed his abject features , in order to castan anxious and troubled glance at the dark assemblage of chiefs 
the silence was finally broken by the aged warrior so often named 
he arose from the earth , and moving pastthe immovable form of uncas , placed himself in a dignified attitude before the offender 
at that moment , the withered squaw already mentioned moved into the circle , in a slow , sidling sort of a dance , holding the torch , and muttering the indistnct words of what might have been a species of incantation 
though her presence was altogether an intrusion , it was unheeded 
approaching uncas , she held the blazing brand in such a manner as to castits red glare on his person , and to expose the slightestemotion of his countenance 
the mohican maintained his firm and haughty attitude 
his eyes , so far from deigning to meet her inquisitive look , dwelt stadily on the distnce , as though it penetrated the obstcles which impeded the view and looked into futurity 
satisfied with her examination , she left him , with a slight expression of pleasure , and proceeded to practise the same trying experiment on her delinquent countryman 
the young huron was in his war paint , and very little of a finely molded form was concealed by his attire 
the light rendered every limb and joint discernible , and duncan turned away in horror when he saw they were writhing in irrepressible agony 
the woman was commencing a low and plaintive howl at the sad and shameful spectacle , when the chief put forth his hand and gently pushed her aside 
reedthatbends , he said , addrssing the young culprit by name , and in his proper language , though the great spirit has made you pleasant to the eyes , it would have been better that you had not been born 
your tongue is loud in the village , but in battle it is stll 
none of my young men stike the tom awk deeper into the war postone of them so lightly on the yengeese 
the enemy know the shape of your back , but they have never seen the color of your eyes 
three times have they called on you to come , and as often did you forget to answer 
your name will never be mentioned again in your tribeit is already forgotten 
as the chief slowly uttered these words , pausing impressively between each sentence , the culprit raised his face , in deference to the other s rank and years 
shame , horror , and pride stuggled in its lineaments 
his eye , which was contracted with inward anguish , gleamed on the persons of those whose breath was his fame 
the latter emotion for an instnt predominated 
he arose to his feet , and baring his bosom , looked stadily on the keen , glittering knife , that was already upheld by his inexorable judge 
as the weapon passed slowly into his heart he even smiled , as if in joy at having found death less dradful than he had anticipated , and fell heavily on his face , at the feet of the rigid and unyielding form of uncas 
the squaw gave a loud and plaintive yell , dashed the torch to the earth , and buried everything in darkness 
the whole shuddering group of spectators glided from the lodge like troubled sprites 
duncan thought that he and the yet throbbing body of the victim of an indian judgment had now become its only tenants 
chapter 24 thus spoke the sage  the kings without delay dissolve the council , and their chief obey 
pope s iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistken 
a hand was laid , with a powerful pressure , on his arm , and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear  the hurons are dogs 
the sight of a coward s blood can never make a warrior tremble 
the  gray head  and the sagamore are safe , and the rifle of hawkeye is not asleep 
gouncas and the  open hand  are now stangers 
it is enough 
heyward would gladly have heard more , but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door , and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse 
slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity , he quitted the place , and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh 
the dying fires in the clearing casta dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stlking to and fro 
occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the lodge , and exhibited the figure of uncas stll maintaining its upright attitude near the dead body of the huron 
a knot of warriors soon entered the place again , and reissuing , they bore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods 
after this termination of the scene , duncan wandered among the lodges , unquestoned and unnoticed , endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran 
in the present temper of the tribe it would have been easy to have fled and rejoined his companions , had such a wish crossed his mind 
in addition to the never ceasing anxiety on account of alice , a fresher though feebler interestin the fate of uncas assistd to chain him to the spot 
he continued , therefore , to stay from hut to hut , looking into each only to encounter additional disappointment , until he had made the entire circuit of the village 
abandoning a species of inquiry that proved so fruitless , he retraced his stps to the councillodge , resolved to seek and queston david , in order to put an end to his doubts 
on reaching the building , which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution , the young man found that the excitement had already subsided 
the warriors had reassembled , and were now calmly smoking , while they conversed gravely on the chief incidents of their recent expedition to the head of the horican 
though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character , and the suspicious circumstnces of his visit , it produced no visible sensation 
far , the terrible scene that had justoccurred proved favorable to his views , and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage 
without seeming to hesitate , he walked into the lodge , and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his host 
a hast but searching glance sufficed to tell him that , though uncas stll remained where he had left him , david had not reappeared 
no other restaint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron , who had placed himself at hand 
though an armed warrior leaned againstthe postthat formed one side of the narrow doorway 
in every other respect , the captive seemed at liberty 
stll he was excluded from all participation in the discourse , and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded sttue than a man having life and volition 
heyward had too recently witnessed a frightful instnce of the prompt punishments of the people into whose hands he had fallen to hazard an exposure by any officious boldness 
he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech , when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instntly fatal 
unfortunately for this prudent resolution , his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed 
he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade , when another of the elder warriors , who spoke the french language , addrssed him  my canada father does not forget his childrn , said the chief 
i thank him 
an evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men 
can the cunning stanger frighten him away 
heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the indians , in the cases of such supposed visitations 
he saw , at a glance , that the circumstnce might possibly be improved to further his own ends 
it would , therefore , have been difficult , justthen to have uttered a proposal that would have given him more satisfaction 
aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character , however , he repressed his feelings , and answered with suitable mystry  spirits differ 
me yield to the power of wisdom , while others are too stong 
my brother is a great medicine , said the cunning savage 
he will try 
a gestre of assent was the answer 
the huron was content with the assurance , and , resuming his pipe , he awaited the proper moment to move 
the impatient heyward , inwardly execrating the cold custms of the savages , which required such sacrifices to appearance , was fain to assume an air of indifference , equal to that maintained by the chief , who was , in truth , a near relative of the afflicted woman 
the minutes lingered , and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in empiricism , when the huron laid aside his pipe and drw his robe across his breast as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid 
justthen , a warrior of powerful frame , darkened the door , and stlking silently among the attentive group , he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustined duncan 
the latter castan impatient look at his neighbor , and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua 
the sudden return of this artful and draded chief caused a delay in the departure of the huron 
several pipes , that had been extinguished , were lighted again 
while the newcomer , without speaking a word , drw his tom awk from his girdle , and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle , with as much indifference as if he had not been absent two weary days on a long and toilsome hunt 
ten minutes , which appeared so many ages to duncan , might have passed in this manner 
the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke 
welcome 
one at length uttered 
has my friend found the moose 
the young men stgger under their burdens , returned magua 
let  areedthatbends  go on the hunting path 
he will meet them 
a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name 
each pipe drpped from the lips of its owner as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instnt 
the smoke wreathed above their heads in little eddies , and curling in a spiral form it ascended swiftly through the opening in the roof of the lodge , leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes , and each dark visage distnctly visible 
the looks of mostof the warriors were riveted on the earth 
though a few of the younger and less gifted of the party suffered their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a whiteheaded savage , who sat between two of the mostvenerated chiefs of the tribe 
there was nothing in the air or attire of this indian that would seem to entitle him to such a distnction 
the former was rather depressed , than remarkable for the bearing of the natives 
the latter was such as was commonly worn by the ordinary men of the nation 
like mostaround him for more than a minute his look , too , was on the ground 
trustng his eyes at length to stal a glance aside , he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention 
he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence 
it was a lie , he said 
i had no son 
he who was called by that name is forgotten 
his blood was pale , and it came not from the veins of a huron 
the wicked chippewas cheated my squaw 
the great spirit has said , that the family of wissentush should end 
he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself 
i have done 
the speaker , who was the father of the recreant young indian , looked round and about him , as if seeking commendation of his sticism in the eyes of the auditors 
the strn custms of his people had made too severe an exaction of the feeble old man 
the expression of his eye contradicted his figurative and boastul language , while every muscle in his wrinkled visage was working with anguish 
stnding a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph , he turned away , as if sickening at the gaze of men , and , veiling his face in his blanket , he walked from the lodge with the noiseless stp of an indian seeking , in the privacy of his own abode , the sympathy of one like himself , aged , forlorn and childless 
the indians , who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects in character , suffered him to depart in silence 
with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated stte of society might profitably emulate , one of the chiefs drw the attention of the young men from the weakness they had justwitnessed , by saying , in a cheerful voice , addrssing himself in courtesy to magua , as the newestcomer  the delawares have been like bears after the honey pots , prowling around my village 
who has ever found a huron asleep 
the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burstof thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed  the delawares of the lakes 
not so 
they who wear the petticoats of squaws , on their own river 
one of them has been passing the tribe 
did my young men take his scalp 
his legs were good , though his arm is better for the hoe than the tom awk , returned the other , pointing to the immovable form of uncas 
instad of manifestng any womanish curiosity to feasthis eyes with the sight of a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to hate , magua continued to smoke , with the meditative air that he usually maintained , when there was no immediate call on his cunning or his eloquence 
although secretly amazed at the facts communicated by the speech of the aged father , he permitted himself to ask no questons , reserving his inquiries for a more suitable moment 
it was only after a sufficient interval that he shook the ashes from his pipe , replaced the tom awk , tightened his girdle , and arose , castng for the firsttime a glance in the direction of the prisoner , who stod a little behind him 
the wary , though seemingly abstacted uncas , caught a glimpse of the movement , and turning suddenly to the light , their looks met 
near a minute these two bold and untamed spirits stod regarding one another stadily in the eye , neither quailing in the leastbefore the fierce gaze he encountered 
the form of uncas dilated , and his nostils opened like those of a tiger at bay 
so rigid and unyielding was his postre , that he might easily have been converted by the imagination into an exquisite and faultless representation of the warlike deity of his tribe 
the lineaments of the quivering features of magua proved more ductile 
his countenance gradually lostits character of defiance in an expression of ferocious joy , and heaving a breath from the very bottom of his chest he pronounced aloud the formidable name of  le cerf agile 
each warrior sprang upon his feet at the utterance of the wellknown appellation , and there was a short period during which the stical constncy of the natives was completely conquered by surprise 
the hated and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice , carrying the sound even beyond the limits of the lodge 
the women and childrn , who lingered around the entrance , took up the words in an echo , which was succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl 
the latter was not yet ended , when the sensation among the men had entirely abated 
each one in presence seated himself , as though ashamed of his precipitation 
it was many minutes before their meaning eyes ceased to roll toward their captive , in curious examination of a warrior who had so often proved his prowess on the bestand proudestof their nation 
uncas enjoyed his victory , but was content with merely exhibiting his triumph by a quiet smilean emblem of scorn which belongs to all time and every nation 
magua caught the expression , and raising his arm , he shook it at the captive , the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling with the trembling agitation of the limb , as , in a tone of vengeance , he exclaimed , in english  mohican , you die 
the healing waters will never bring the dead hurons to life , returned uncas , in the music of the delawares 
the tumbling river washes their bones 
their men are squaws  their women owls 
go 
call together the huron dogs , that they may look upon a warrior , my nostils are offended 
they scent the blood of a coward 
the latter allusion stuck deep , and the injury rankled 
many of the hurons understod the stange tongue in which the captive spoke , among which number was magua 
this cunning savage beheld , and instntly profited by his advantage 
drpping the light robe of skin from his shoulder , he stetched forth his arm , and commenced a burstof his dangerous and artful eloquence 
however much his influence among his people had been impaired by his occasional and besetting weakness , as well as by his desertion of the tribe , his courage and his fame as an orator were undeniable 
he never spoke without auditors , and rarely without making converts to his opinions 
on the present occasion , his native powers were stmulated by the thirstof revenge 
he again recounted the events of the attack on the island at glenn s , the death of his associates and the escape of their mostformidable enemies 
he described the nature and position of the mount whither he had led such captives as had fallen into their hands 
of his own bloody intentions toward the maidens , and of his baffled malice he made no mention , but passed rapidly on to the surprise of the party by la longue carabine , and its fatal termination 
here he paused , and looked about him , in affected veneration for the departed , but , in truth , to note the effect of his opening narrative 
as usual , every eye was riveted on his face 
each dusky figure seemed a breathing sttue , so motionless was the postre , so intense the attention of the individual 
magua drpped his voice which had hitherto been clear , stong and elevated , and touched upon the merits of the dead 
no quality that was likely to command the sympathy of an indian escaped his notice 
one had never been known to follow the chase in vain 
another had been indefatigable on the trail of their enemies 
this was brave , that generous 
in short , he so managed his allusions , that in a nation which was composed of so few families , he contrived to stike every chord that might find , in its turn , some breastin which to vibrate 
are the bones of my young men , he concluded , in the burialplace of the hurons 
you know they are not 
their spirits are gone toward the setting sun , and are already crossing the great waters , to the happy huntinggrounds 
they departed without food , without guns or knives , without moccasins , naked and poor as they were born 
shall this be 
are their souls to enter the land of the justlike hungry iroquois or unmanly delawares , or shall they meet their friends with arms in their hands and robes on their backs 
what will our fathers think the tribes of the wyandots have become 
they will look on their childrn with a dark eye , and say ,  go 
a chippewa has come hither with the name of a huron  brothers , we mustnot forget the dead 
a redskin never ceases to remember 
we will load the back of this mohican until he stggers under our bounty , and dispatch him after my young men 
they call to us for aid , though our ears are not open 
they say ,  forget us not  when they see the spirit of this mohican toiling after them with his burden , they will know we are of that mind 
will they go on happy 
our childrn will say ,  so did our fathers to their friends , so mustwe do to them  what is a yengee 
we have slain many , but the earth is stll pale 
a stin on the name of huron can only be hid by blood that comes from the veins of an indian 
let this delaware die 
the effect of such an harangue , delivered in the nervous language and with the emphatic manner of a huron orator , could scarcely be mistken 
magua had so artfully blended the natural sympathies with the religious supersttion of his auditors , that their minds , already prepared by custm to sacrifice a victim to the manes of their countrymen , lostevery vestge of humanity in a wish for revenge 
one warrior in particular , a man of wild and ferocious mien , had been conspicuous for the attention he had given to the words of the speaker 
his countenance had changed with each passing emotion , until it settled into a look of deadly malice 
as magua ended he arose and , uttering the yell of a demon , his polished little axe was seen glancing in the torchlight as he whirled it above his head 
the motion and the cry were too sudden for words to interrupt his bloody intention 
it appeared as if a bright gleam shot from his hand , which was crossed at the same moment by a dark and powerful line 
the former was the tom awk in its passage 
the latter the arm that magua darted forward to divert its aim 
the quick and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late 
the keen weapon cut the war plume from the scalping tuft of uncas , and passed through the frail wall of the lodge as though it were hurled from some formidable engine 
duncan had seen the threatening action , and sprang upon his feet , with a heart which , while it leaped into his throat , swelled with the mostgenerous resolution in behalf of his friend 
a glance told him that the blow had failed , and terror changed to admiration 
uncas stod stll , looking his enemy in the eye with features that seemed superior to emotion 
marble could not be colder , calmer , or stadier than the countenance he put upon this sudden and vindictive attack 
as if pitying a want of skill which had proved so fortunate to himself , he smiled , and muttered a few words of contempt in his own tongue 
no 
the sun mustshine on his shame 
the squaws mustsee his flesh tremble , or our revenge will be like the play of boys 
go 
take him where there is silence 
let us see if a delaware can sleep at night , and in the morning die 
the young men whose duty it was to guard the prisoner instntly passed their ligaments of bark across his arms , and led him from the lodge , amid a profound and ominous silence 
it was only as the figure of uncas stod in the opening of the door that his firm stp hesitated 
there he turned , and , in the sweeping and haughty glance that he threw around the circle of his enemies , duncan caught a look which he was glad to constue into an expression that he was not entirely deserted by hope 
magua was content with his success , or too much occupied with his secret purposes to push his inquiries any further 
shaking his mantle , and folding it on his bosom , he also quitted the place , without pursuing a subject which might have proved so fatal to the individual at his elbow 
notwithstnding his rising resentment , his natural firmness , and his anxiety on behalf of uncas , heyward felt sensibly relieved by the absence of so dangerous and so subtle a foe 
the excitement produced by the speech gradually subsided 
the warriors resumed their seats and clouds of smoke once more filled the lodge 
for near half an hour , not a syllable was uttered , or scarcely a look castaside 
a grave and meditative silence being the ordinary succession to every scene of violence and commotion among these beings , who were alike so impetuous and yet so selfrestained 
when the chief , who had solicited the aid of duncan , finished his pipe , he made a final and successful movement toward departing 
a motion of a finger was the intimation he gave the supposed physician to follow 
passing through the clouds of smoke , duncad was glad , on more accounts than one , to be able at lastto breathe the pure air of a cool and refreshing summer evening 
instad of pursuing his way among those lodges where heyward had already made his unsuccessful search , his companion turned aside , and proceeded directly toward the base of an adjacent mountain , which overhung the temporary village 
a thicket of brush skirted its foot , and it became necessary to proceed through a crooked and narrow path 
the boys had resumed their sports in the clearing , and were enacting a mimic chase to the postamong themselves 
in order to render their games as like the reality as possible , one of the boldestof their number had conveyed a few brands into some piles of treetops that had hitherto escaped the burning 
the blaze of one of these fires lighted the way of the chief and duncan , and gave a character of additional wildness to the rude scenery 
at a little distnce from a bald rock , and directly in its front , they entered a grassy opening , which they prepared to cross 
justthen fresh fuel was added to the fire , and a powerful light penetrated even to that distnt spot 
it fell upon the white surface of the mountain , and was reflected downward upon a dark and mystriouslooking being that arose , unexpectedly , in their path 
the indian paused , as if doubtful whether to proceed , and permitted his companion to approach his side 
a large black ball , which at firstseemed sttionary , now began to move in a manner that to the latter was inexplicable 
again the fire brightened and its glare fell more distnctly on the object 
even duncan knew it , by its restess and sidling attitudes , which kept the upper part of its form in constnt motion , while the animal itself appeared seated , to be a bear 
though it growled loudly and fiercely , and there were instnts when its glistning eyeballs might be seen , it gave no other indications of hostlity 
the huron , at least seemed assured that the intentions of this singular intruder were peaceable , for after giving it an attentive examination , he quietly pursued his course 
duncan , who knew that the animal was often domestcated among the indians , followed the example of his companion , believing that some favorite of the tribe had found its way into the thicket , in search of food 
they passed it unmolestd 
though obliged to come nearly in contact with the monstr , the huron , who had at firstso warily determined the character of his stange visitor , was now content with proceeding without wastng a moment in further examination 
heyward was unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward , in salutary watchfulness againstattacks in the rear 
his uneasiness was in no degree diminished when he perceived the beastrolling along their path , and following their footstps 
he would have spoken , but the indian at that moment shoved aside a door of bark , and entered a cavern in the bosom of the mountain 
profiting by so easy a method of retreat , duncan stpped after him , and was gladly closing the slight cover to the opening , when he felt it drwn from his hand by the beast whose shaggy form immediately darkened the passage 
they were now in a staight and long gallery , in a chasm of the rocks , where retreat without encountering the animal was impossible 
making the bestof the circumstnces , the young man pressed forward , keeping as close as possible to his conductor 
the bear growled frequently at his heels , and once or twice its enormous paws were laid on his person , as if disposed to prevent his further passage into the den 
how long the nerves of heyward would have sustined him in this extraordinary situation , it might be difficult to decide , for , happily , he soon found relief 
a glimmer of light had constntly been in their front , and they now arrived at the place whence it proceeded 
a large cavity in the rock had been rudely fitted to answer the purposes of many apartments 
the subdivisions were simple but ingenious , being composed of stne , stcks , and bark , intermingled 
openings above admitted the light by day , and at night fires and torches supplied the place of the sun 
hither the hurons had brought mostof their valuables , especially those which more particularly pertained to the nation 
hither , as it now appeared , the sick woman , who was believed to be the victim of supernatural power , had been transported also , under an impression that her tormentor would find more difficulty in making his assaults through walls of stne than through the leafy coverings of the lodges 
the apartment into which duncan and his guide firstentered , had been exclusively devoted to her accommodation 
the latter approached her bedside , which was surrounded by females , in the center of whom heyward was surprised to find his missing friend david 
a single look was sufficient to apprise the pretended leech that the invalid was far beyond his powers of healing 
she lay in a sort of paralysis , indifferent to the objects which crowded before her sight , and happily unconscious of suffering 
heyward was far from regretting that his mummeries were to be performed on one who was much too ill to take an interestin their failure or success 
the slight qualm of conscience which had been excited by the intended deception was instntly appeased , and he began to collect his thoughts , in order to enact his part with suitable spirit , when he found he was about to be anticipated in his skill by an attempt to prove the power of music 
gamut , who had stod prepared to pour forth his spirit in song when the visitors entered , after delaying a moment , drw a stain from his pipe , and commenced a hymn that might have worked a miracle , had faith in is efficacy been of much avail 
he was allowed to proceed to the close , the indians respecting his imaginary infirmity , and duncan too glad of the delay to hazard the slightestinterruption 
as the dying cadence of his stains was falling on the ears of the latter , he strted aside at hearing them repeated behind him , in a voice half human and half sepulchral 
looking around , he beheld the shaggy monstr seated on end in a shadow of the cavern , where , while his restess body swung in the uneasy manner of the animal , it repeated , in a sort of low growl , sounds , if not words , which bore some slight resemblance to the melody of the singer 
the effect of so stange an echo on david may better be imagined than described 
his eyes opened as if he doubted their truth 
his voice became instntly mute in excess of wonder 
a deeplaid scheme , of communicating some important intelligence to heyward , was drven from his recollection by an emotion which very nearly resembled fear , but which he was fain to believe was admiration 
under its influence , he exclaimed aloud  she expects you , and is at hand 
precipitately left the cavern 
chapter 25 snug 
have you the lion s part written 
pray you , if it be , give it to me , for i am slow of stdy 
quince 
you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring 
midsummer night s dram there was a stange blending of the ridiculous with that which was solemn in this scene 
the beastsill continued its rolling , and apparently untiring movements , though its ludicrous attempt to imitate the melody of david ceased the instnt the latter abandoned the field 
the words of gamut were , as has been seen , in his native tongue 
to duncan they seem pregnant with some hidden meaning , though nothing present assistd him in discovering the object of their allusion 
a speedy end was , however , put to every conjecture on the subject , by the manner of the chief , who advanced to the bedside of the invalid , and beckoned away the whole group of female attendants that had clustred there to witness the skill of the stanger 
he was implicitly , though reluctantly , obeyed 
when the low echo which rang along the hollow , natural gallery , from the distnt closing door , had ceased , pointing toward his insensible daughter , he said  now let my brother show his power 
thus unequivocally called on to exercise the functions of his assumed character , heyward was apprehensive that the smallestdelay might prove dangerous 
endeavoring , then , to collect his ideas , he prepared to perform that species of incantation , and those uncouth rites , under which the indian conjurers are accustmed to conceal their ignorance and impotency 
it is more than probable that , in the disordered stte of his thoughts , he would soon have fallen into some suspicious , if not fatal , error had not his incipient attempts been interrupted by a fierce growl from the quadrped 
three several times did he renew his efforts to proceed , and as often was he met by the same unaccountable opposition , each interruption seeming more savage and threatening than the preceding 
the cunning ones are jealous , said the huron 
i go brother , the woman is the wife of one of my bravestyoung men 
deal justy by her 
peace 
he added , beckoning to the discontented beastto be quiet 
i go 
the chief was as good as his word , and duncan now found himself alone in that wild and desolate abode with the helpless invalid and the fierce and dangerous brute 
the latter listned to the movements of the indian with that air of sagacity that a bear is known to possess , until another echo announced that he had also left the cavern , when it turned and came waddling up to duncan before whom it seated itself in its natural attitude , erect like a man 
the youth looked anxiously about him for some weapon , with which he might make a resistnce againstthe attack he now seriously expected 
it seemed , however , as if the humor of the animal had suddenly changed 
instad of continuing its discontented growls , or manifestng any further signs of anger , the whole of its shaggy body shook violently , as if agitated by some stange internal convulsion 
the huge and unwieldy talons pawed stpidly about the grinning muzzle , and while heyward kept his eyes riveted on its movements with jealous watchfulness , the grim head fell on one side and in its place appeared the honeststrdy countenance of the scout , who was indulging from the bottom of his soul in his own peculiar expression of merriment 
hist said the wary woodsman , interrupting heyward s exclamation of surprise 
the varlets are about the place , and any sounds that are not natural to witchcraft would bring them back upon us in a body 
tell me the meaning of this masquerade 
why you have attempted so desperate an adventure 
 , reason and calculation are often outdone by accident , returned the scout 
as a stry should always commence at the beginning , i will tell you the whole in order 
after we parted i placed the commandant and the sagamore in an old beaver lodge , where they are safer from the hurons than they would be in the garrison of edward for your high northwestindians , not having as yet got the traders among them , continued to venerate the beaver 
after which uncas and i pushed for the other encampment as was agreed 
have you seen the lad 
to my great grief 
he is captive , and condemned to die at the rising of the sun 
i had misgivings that such would be his fate , resumed the scout , in a less confident and joyous tone 
soon regaining his naturally firm voice , he continued  his bad fortune is the true reason of my being here , for it would never do to abandon such a boy to the hurons 
a rare time the knaves would have of it , could they tie  the bounding elk  and  the long carabine  , as they call me , to the same stke 
though why they have given me such a name i never knew , there being as little likeness between the gifts of  killdeer  and the performance of one of your real canada carabynes , as there is between the natur  of a pipestne and a flint 
keep to your tale , said the impatient heyward 
we know not at what moment the hurons may return 
no fear of them 
a conjurer musthave his time , like a staggling priestin the settlements 
we are as safe from interruption as a missionary would be at the beginning of a two hours  discourse 
well , uncas and i fell in with a return party of the varlets 
the lad was much too forward for a scout 
nay , for that matter , being of hot blood , he was not so much to blame 
after all , one of the hurons proved a coward , and in fleeing led him into an ambushment 
dearly has he paid for the weakness 
the scout significantly passed his hand across his own throat , and nodded , as if he said , i comprehend your meaning 
after which he continued , in a more audible though scarcely more intelligible language  after the loss of the boy i turned upon the hurons , as you may judge 
there have been scrimmages atween one or two of their outlyers and myself 
that is neither here nor there 
after i had shot the imps , i got in pretty nigh to the lodges without further commotion 
what should luck do in my favor but lead me to the very spot where one of the mostfamous conjurers of the tribe was drssing himself , as i well knew , for some great battle with satan though why should i call that luck , which it now seems was an especial ordering of providence 
a judgmatical rap over the head stffened the lying impostr for a time , and leaving him a bit of walnut for his supper , to prevent an uproar , and stinging him up atween two saplings , i made free with his finery , and took the part of the bear on myself , in order that the operations might proceed 
admirably did you enact the character 
the animal itself might have been shamed by the representation 
lord , major , returned the flattered woodsman , i should be but a poor scholar for one who has stdied so long in the wilderness , did i not know how to set forth the movements of natur  of such a beast  had it been now a catamount , or even a fullsize panther , i would have embellished a performance for you worth regarding 
it is no such marvelous feat to exhibit the feats of so dull a beast though , for that matter , too , a bear may be overacted 
yes , yes 
it is not every imitator that knows natur  may be outdone easier than she is equaled 
all our work is yet before us 
where is the gentle one 
heaven knows 
i have examined every lodge in the village , without discovering the slightesttrace of her presence in the tribe 
you heard what the singer said , as he left us   she is at hand , and expects you  
i have been compelled to believe he alluded to this unhappy woman 
the simpleton was frightened , and blundered through his message 
he had a deeper meaning 
here are walls enough to separate the hole settlement 
a bear ought to climb 
therefore will i take a look above them 
there may be honey pots hid in these rocks , and i am a beast you know , that has a hankering for the sweets 
the scout looked behind him , laughing at his own conceit , while he clambered up the partition , imitating , as he went , the clumsy motions of the beasthe represented 
the instnt the summit was gained he made a gestre for silence , and slid down with the utmostprecipitation 
she is here , he whispered , and by that door you will find her 
i would have spoken a word of comfort to the afflicted soul 
the sight of such a monstr might upset her reason 
though for that matter , major , you are none of the mostinviting yourself in your paint 
duncan , who had already swung eagerly forward , drw instntly back on hearing these discouraging words 
am i , then , so very revolting 
he demanded , with an air of chagrin 
you might not strtle a wolf , or turn the royal americans from a discharge 
i have seen the time when you had a better favored look 
your steaked countenances are not ill judged of by the squaws , but young women of white blood give the preference to their own color 
see , he added , pointing to a place where the water trickled from a rock , forming a little crystl spring , before it found an issue through the adjacent crevices 
you may easily get rid of the sagamore s daub , and when you come back i will try my hand at a new embellishment 
it s as common for a conjurer to alter his paint as for a buck in the settlements to change his finery 
the deliberate woodsman had little occasion to hunt for arguments to enforce his advice 
he was yet speaking when duncan availed himself of the water 
in a moment every frightful or offensive mark was obliterated , and the youth appeared again in the lineaments with which he had been gifted by nature 
thus prepared for an interview with his mistess , he took a hast leave of his companion , and disappeared through the indicated passage 
the scout witnessed his departure with complacency , nodding his head after him , and muttering his good wishes 
after which he very coolly set about an examination of the stte of the larder , among the hurons , the cavern , among other purposes , being used as a receptacle for the fruits of their hunts 
duncan had no other guide than a distnt glimmering light , which served , however , the office of a polar str to the lover 
by its aid he was enabled to enter the haven of his hopes , which was merely another apartment of the cavern , that had been solely appropriated to the safekeeping of so important a prisoner as a daughter of the commandant of william henry 
it was profusely stewed with the plunder of that unlucky fortress 
in the midstof this confusion he found her he sought , pale , anxious and terrified , but lovely 
david had prepared her for such a visit 
duncan 
she exclaimed , in a voice that seemed to tremble at the sounds created by itself 
alice 
he answered , leaping carelessly among trunks , boxes , arms , and furniture , until he stod at her side 
i knew that you would never desert me , she said , looking up with a momentary glow on her otherwise dejected countenance 
you are alone 
grateful as it is to be thus remembered , i could wish to think you are not entirely alone 
duncan , observing that she trembled in a manner which betrayed her inability to stnd , gently induced her to be seated , while he recounted those leading incidents which it has been our task to accord 
alice listned with breathless interest and though the young man touched lightly on the sorrows of the sticken father 
taking care , however , not to wound the selflove of his auditor , the tears ran as freely down the cheeks of the daughter as though she had never wept before 
the soothing tenderness of duncan , however , soon quieted the firstburstof her emotions , and she then heard him to the close with undivided attention , if not with composure 
now , alice , he added , you will see how much is stll expected of you 
by the assistnce of our experienced and invaluable friend , the scout , we may find our way from this savage people , but you will have to exert your utmostfortitude 
remember that you fly to the arms of your venerable parent , and how much his happiness , as well as your own , depends on those exertions 
can i do otherwise for a father who has done so much for me 
for me , too , continued the youth , gently pressing the hand he held in both his own 
the look of innocence and surprise which he received in return convinced duncan of the necessity of being more explicit 
this is neither the place nor the occasion to detain you with selfish wishes , he added 
what heart loaded like mine would not wish to castits burden 
they say misery is the closestof all ties 
our common suffering in your behalf left but little to be explained between your father and myself 
dearestcora , duncan 
surely cora was not forgotten 
not forgotten 
no 
regretted , as woman was seldom mourned before 
your venerable father knew no difference between his childrn 
ialice , you will not be offended when i say , that to me her worth was in a degree obscured then you knew not the merit of my sistr , said alice , withdrwing her hand 
of you she ever speaks as of one who is her dearestfriend 
i would gladly believe her such , returned duncan , hastly 
i could wish her to be even more 
with you , alice , i have the permission of your father to aspire to a stll nearer and dearer tie 
alice trembled violently , and there was an instnt during which she bent her face aside , yielding to the emotions common to her sex 
they quickly passed away , leaving her mistess of her deportment , if not of her affections 
heyward , she said , looking him full in the face with a touching expression of innocence and dependency , give me the sacred presence and the holy sanction of that parent before you urge me further 
though more i should not , less i could not say , the youth was about to answer , when he was interrupted by a light tap on his shoulder 
strting to his feet , he turned , and , confronting the intruder , his looks fell on the dark form and malignant visage of magua 
the deep guttural laugh of the savage sounded , at such a moment , to duncan , like the hellish taunt of a demon 
had he pursued the sudden and fierce impulse of the instnt , he would have casthimself on the huron , and committed their fortunes to the issue of a deadly stuggle 
without arms of any description , ignorant of what succor his subtle enemy could command , and charged with the safety of one who was justthen dearer than ever to his heart , he no sooner entertained than he abandoned the desperate intention 
what is your purpose 
the exulting indian had resumed his austre countenance , though he drw warily back before the menacing glance of the young man s fiery eye 
he regarded both his captives for a moment with a stady look , and then , stpping aside , he drpped a log of wood across a door different from that by which duncan had entered 
the latter now comprehended the manner of his surprise , and , believing himself irretrievably lost he drw alice to his bosom , and stod prepared to meet a fate which he hardly regretted , since it was to be suffered in such company 
magua meditated no immediate violence 
his firstmeasures were very evidently taken to secure his new captive 
nor did he even bestw a second glance at the motionless forms in the center of the cavern , until he had completely cut off every hope of retreat through the private outlet he had himself used 
he was watched in all his movements by heyward , who , however , remained firm , stll folding the fragile form of alice to his heart , at once too proud and too hopeless to ask favor of an enemy so often foiled 
when magua had effected his object he approached his prisoners , and said in english  the pale faces trap the cunning beavers 
the redskins know how to take the yengeese 
huron , do your worst exclaimed the excited heyward , forgetful that a double stke was involved in his life 
you and your vengeance are alike despised 
will the white man speak these words at the stke 
asked magua 
manifestng , at the same time , how little faith he had in the other s resolution by the sneer that accompanied his words 
here 
singly to your face , or in the presence of your nation 
le renard subtil is a great chief 
returned the indian 
he will go and bring his young men , to see how bravely a pale face can laugh at tortures 
he turned away while speaking , and was about to leave the place through the avenue by which duncan had approached , when a growl caught his ear , and caused him to hesitate 
the figure of the bear appeared in the door , where it sat , rolling from side to side in its custmary restessness 
magua , like the father of the sick woman , eyed it keenly for a moment , as if to ascertain its character 
he was far above the more vulgar supersttions of his tribe , and so soon as he recognized the wellknown attire of the conjurer , he prepared to pass it in cool contempt 
a louder and more threatening growl caused him again to pause 
he seemed as if suddenly resolved to trifle no longer , and moved resolutely forward 
the mimic animal , which had advanced a little , retired slowly in his front , until it arrived again at the pass , when , rearing on his hinder legs , it beat the air with its paws , in the manner practised by its brutal prototype 
fool 
exclaimed the chief , in huron , go play with the childrn and squaws 
leave men to their wisdom 
he once more endeavored to pass the supposed empiric , scorning even the parade of threatening to use the knife , or tom awk , that was pendent from his belt 
suddenly the beastextended its arms , or rather legs , and inclosed him in a grasp that might have vied with the farfamed power of the bear s hug itself 
heyward had watched the whole procedure , on the part of hawkeye , with breathless interest at firsthe relinquished his hold of alice 
he caught up a thong of buckskin , which had been used around some bundle , and when he beheld his enemy with his two arms pinned to his side by the iron muscles of the scout , he rushed upon him , and effectually secured them there 
arms , legs , and feet were encircled in twenty folds of the thong , in less time than we have taken to record the circumstnce 
when the formidable huron was completely pinioned , the scout released his hold , and duncan laid his enemy on his back , utterly helpless 
throughout the whole of this sudden and extraordinary operation , magua , though he had stuggled violently , until assured he was in the hands of one whose nerves were far better stung than his own , had not uttered the slightestexclamation 
when hawkeye , by way of making a summary explanation of his conduct , removed the shaggy jaws of the beast and exposed his own rugged and earnestcountenance to the gaze of the huron , the philosophy of the latter was so far mastred as to permit him to utter the never failing  hugh 
ay , you have found your tongue , said his undistrbed conqueror 
now , in order that you shall not use it to our ruin , i mustmake free to stp your mouth 
as there was no time to be lost the scout immediately set about effecting so necessary a precaution 
when he had gagged the indian , his enemy might safely have been considered as hors de combat 
by what place did the imp enter 
asked the industious scout , when his work was ended 
not a soul has passed my way since you left me 
duncan pointed out the door by which magua had come , and which now presented too many obstcles to a quick retreat 
bring on the gentle one , then , continued his friend 
we mustmake a push for the woods by the other outlet 
tis impossible 
fear has overcome her , and she is helpless 
alice 
my sweet , my own alice , arouse yourself 
now is the moment to fly 
tis in vain 
she hears , but is unable to follow 
go , noble and worthy friend 
save yourself , and leave me to my fate 
every trail has its end , and every calamity brings its lesson 
returned the scout 
there , wrap her in them indian cloths 
conceal all of her little form 
nay , that foot has no fellow in the wilderness 
it will betray her 
all , every part 
now take her in your arms , and follow 
leave the restto me 
duncan , as may be gathered from the words of his companion , was eagerly obeying 
as the other finished speaking , he took the light person of alice in his arms , and followed in the footstps of the scout 
they found the sick woman as they had left her , stll alone , and passed swiftly on , by the natural gallery , to the place of entrance 
as they approached the little door of bark , a murmur of voices without announced that the friends and relatives of the invalid were gathered about the place , patiently awaiting a summons to reenter 
if i open my lips to speak , hawkeye whispered , my english , which is the genuine tongue of a whiteskin , will tell the varlets that an enemy is among them 
you mustgive  em your jargon , major 
say that we have shut the evil spirit in the cave , and are taking the woman to the woods in order to find stengthening roots 
practise all your cunning , for it is a lawful undertaking 
the door opened a little , as if one without was listning to the proceedings within , and compelled the scout to cease his directions 
a fierce growl repelled the eavesdrpper , and then the scout boldly threw open the covering of bark , and left the place , enacting the character of a bear as he proceeded 
duncan kept close at his heels , and soon found himself in the center of a clustr of twenty anxious relatives and friends 
the crowd fell back a little , and permitted the father , and one who appeared to be the husband of the woman , to approach 
has my brother drven away the evil spirit 
demanded the former 
what has he in his arms 
thy child , returned duncan , gravely 
the disease has gone out of her 
it is shut up in the rocks 
i take the woman to a distnce , where i will stengthen her againstany further attacks 
she will be in the wigwam of the young man when the sun comes again 
when the father had translated the meaning of the stanger s words into the huron language , a suppressed murmur announced the satisfaction with which this intelligence was received 
the chief himself waved his hand for duncan to proceed , saying aloud , in a firm voice , and with a lofty manner  go 
i am a man , and i will enter the rock and fight the wicked one 
heyward had gladly obeyed , and was already pastthe little group , when these strtling words arrestd him 
is my brother mad 
he exclaimed 
is he cruel 
he will meet the disease , and it will enter him 
or he will drve out the disease , and it will chase his daughter into the woods 
no 
let my childrn wait without , and if the spirit appears beat him down with clubs 
he is cunning , and will bury himself in the mountain , when he sees how many are ready to fight him 
this singular warning had the desired effect 
instad of entering the cavern , the father and husband drw their tom awks , and postd themselves in readiness to deal their vengeance on the imaginary tormentor of their sick relative , while the women and childrn broke branches from the bushes , or seized fragments of the rock , with a similar intention 
at this favorable moment the counterfeit conjurers disappeared 
hawkeye , at the same time that he had presumed so far on the nature of the indian supersttions , was not ignorant that they were rather tolerated than relied on by the wisestof the chiefs 
he well knew the value of time in the present emergency 
whatever might be the extent of the self delusion of his enemies , and however it had tended to assisthis schemes , the slightestcause of suspicion , acting on the subtle nature of an indian , would be likely to prove fatal 
taking the path , therefore , that was mostlikely to avoid observation , he rather skirted than entered the village 
the warriors were stll to be seen in the distnce , by the fading light of the fires , stlking from lodge to lodge 
the childrn had abandoned their sports for their beds of skins , and the quiet of night was already beginning to prevail over the turbulence and excitement of so busy and important an evening 
alice revived under the renovating influence of the open air , and , as her physical rather than her mental powers had been the subject of weakness , she stod in no need of any explanation of that which had occurred 
now let me make an effort to walk , she said , when they had entered the forest blushing , though unseen , that she had not been sooner able to quit the arms of duncan 
i am indeed restred 
nay , alice , you are yet too weak 
the maiden stuggled gently to release herself , and heyward was compelled to part with his precious burden 
the representative of the bear had certainly been an entire stanger to the delicious emotions of the lover while his arms encircled his mistess 
he was , perhaps , a stanger also to the nature of that feeling of ingenuous shame that oppressed the trembling alice 
when he found himself at a suitable distnce from the lodges he made a halt , and spoke on a subject of which he was thoroughly the mastr 
this path will lead you to the brook , he said 
follow its northern bank until you come to a fall 
mount the hill on your right , and you will see the fires of the other people 
there you mustgo and demand protection 
if they are true delawares you will be safe 
a distnt flight with that gentle one , justnow , is impossible 
the hurons would follow up our trail , and mastr our scalps before we had got a dozen miles 
go , and providence be with you 
you 
demanded heyward , in surprise 
surely we part not here 
the hurons hold the pride of the delawares 
the lastof the high blood of the mohicans is in their power , returned the scout 
i go to see what can be done in his favor 
had they mastred your scalp , major , a knave should have fallen for every hair it held , as i promised 
if the young sagamore is to be led to the stke , the indians shall see also how a man without a cross can die 
not in the leastoffended with the decided preference that the strdy woodsman gave to one who might , in some degree , be called the child of his adoption , duncan stll continued to urge such reasons againstso desperate an effort as presented themselves 
he was aided by alice , who mingled her entreaties with those of heyward that he would abandon a resolution that promised so much danger , with so little hope of success 
their eloquence and ingenuity were expended in vain 
the scout heard them attentively , but impatiently , and finally closed the discussion , by answering , in a tone that instntly silenced alice , while it told heyward how fruitless any further remonstances would be 
i have heard , he said , that there is a feeling in youth which binds man to woman closer than the father is tied to the son 
it may be so 
i have seldom been where women of my color dwell 
such may be the gifts of nature in the settlements 
you have risked life , and all that is dear to you , to bring off this gentle one , and i suppose that some such disposition is at the bottom of it all 
as for me , i taught the lad the real character of a rifle 
well has he paid me for it 
i have fou t at his side in many a bloody scrimmage 
so long as i could hear the crack of his piece in one ear , and that of the sagamore in the other , i knew no enemy was on my back 
winters and summer , nights and days , have we roved the wilderness in company , eating of the same dish , one sleeping while the other watched 
afore it shall be said that uncas was taken to the torment , and i at handthere is but a single ruler of us all , whatever may the color of the skin 
him i call to witness , that before the mohican boy shall perish for the want of a friend , good faith shall depart the  arth , and  killdeer  become as harmless as the tooting we pon of the singer 
duncan released his hold on the arm of the scout , who turned , and stadily retraced his stps toward the lodges 
after pausing a moment to gaze at his retiring form , the successful and yet sorrowful heyward and alice took their way together toward the distnt village of the delawares 
chapter 26 bot 
let me play the lion too 
midsummer night s dram notwithstnding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur 
in his return to the camp , his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies , that he knew were , in no degree , inferior to his own 
nothing but the color of his skin had saved the lives of magua and the conjurer , who would have been the firstvictims sacrificed to his own security , had not the scout believed such an act , however congenial it might be to the nature of an indian , utterly unworthy of one who boastd a descent from men that knew no cross of blood 
accordingly , he trustd to the withes and ligaments with which he had bound his captives , and pursued his way directly toward the center of the lodges 
as he approached the buildings , his stps become more deliberate , and his vigilant eye suffered no sign , whether friendly or hostle , to escape him 
a neglected hut was a little in advance of the others , and appeared as if it had been deserted when half completed mostprobably on account of failing in some of the more important requisites 
such as wood or water 
a faint light glimmered through its cracks , however , and announced that , notwithstnding its imperfect stucture , it was not without a tenant 
thither , then , the scout proceeded , like a prudent general , who was about to feel the advanced positions of his enemy , before he hazarded the main attack 
throwing himself into a suitable postre for the beasthe represented , hawkeye crawled to a little opening , where he might command a view of the interior 
it proved to be the abiding place of david gamut 
hither the faithful singing mastr had now brought himself , together with all his sorrows , his apprehensions , and his meek dependence on the protection of providence 
at the precise moment when his ungainly person came under the observation of the scout , in the manner justmentioned , the woodsman himself , though in his assumed character , was the subject of the solitary being s profounded reflections 
however implicit the faith of david was in the performance of ancient miracles , he eschewed the belief of any direct supernatural agency in the management of modern morality 
in other words , while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam s ass to speak , he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear s singing 
yet he had been assured of the latter , on the testmony of his own exquisite organs 
there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the stte of his mind 
he was seated on a pile of brush , a few twigs from which occasionally fed his low fire , with his head leaning on his arm , in a postre of melancholy musing 
the costme of the votary of music had undergone no other alteration from that so lately described , except that he had covered his bald head with the triangular beaver , which had not proved sufficiently alluring to excite the cupidity of any of his captors 
the ingenious hawkeye , who recalled the hast manner in which the other had abandoned his postat the bedside of the sick woman , was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation 
firstmaking the circuit of the hut , and ascertaining that it stod quite alone , and that the character of its inmate was likely to protect it from visitors , he ventured through its low door , into the very presence of gamut 
the position of the latter brought the fire between them 
when hawkeye had seated himself on end , near a minute elapsed , during which the two remained regarding each other without speaking 
the suddenness and the nature of the surprise had nearly proved too much forwe will not say the philosophybut for the pitch and resolution of david 
he fumbled for his pitch pipe , and arose with a confused intention of attempting a musical exorcism 
dark and mystrious monstr 
he exclaimed , while with trembling hands he disposed of his auxiliary eyes , and sought his neverfailing resource in trouble , the gifted version of the psalms 
i know not your nature nor intents 
if aught you meditate againstthe person and rights of one of the humblestservants of the temple , listn to the inspired language of the youth of israel , and repent 
the bear shook his shaggy sides , and then a wellknown voice replied  put up the tooting we pon , and teach your throat modest 
five words of plain and comprehendible english are worth justnow an hour of squalling 
what art thou 
demanded david , utterly disqualified to pursue his original intention , and nearly gasping for breath 
a man like yourself 
one whose blood is as little tainted by the cross of a bear , or an indian , as your own 
have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instument you hold in your hand 
can these things be 
returned david , breathing more freely , as the truth began to dawn upon him 
i have found many marvels during my sojourn with the heathen , but surely nothing to excel this 
come , come , returned hawkeye , uncasing his honestcountenance , the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion 
you may see a skin , which , if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones , has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestwed 
now let us to business 
firsttell me of the maiden , and of the youth who so bravely sought her , interrupted david 
ay , they are happily freed from the tom awks of these varlets 
can you put me on the scent of uncas 
the young man is in bondage , and much i fear his death is decreed 
i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance , and i have sought a goodly hymn can you lead me to him 
the task will not be difficult , returned david , hesitating 
though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes 
no more words , but lead on , returned hawkeye , concealing his face again , and setting the example in his own person , by instntly quitting the lodge 
as they proceeded , the scout ascertained that his companion found access to uncas , under privilege of his imaginary infirmity , aided by the favor he had acquired with one of the guards , who , in consequence of speaking a little english , had been selected by david as the subject of a religious conversion 
how far the huron comprehended the intentions of his new friend may well be doubted 
as exclusive attention is as flattering to a savage as to a more civilized individual , it had produced the effect we have mentioned 
it is unnecessary to repeat the shrewd manner with which the scout extracted these particulars from the simple david 
neither shall we dwell in this place on the nature of the instuction he delivered , when completely mastr of all the necessary facts 
as the whole will be sufficiently explained to the reader in the course of the narrative 
the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village , and in a situation , perhaps , more difficult than any other to approach , or leave , without observation 
it was not the policy of hawkeye to affect the leastconcealment 
presuming on his disguise , and his ability to sustin the character he had assumed , he took the mostplain and direct route to the place 
the hour , however , afforded him some little of that protection which he appeared so much to despise 
the boys were already buried in sleep , and all the women , and mostof the warriors , had retired to their lodges for the night 
four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas , wary by close observers of the manner of their captive 
at the sight of gamut , accompanied by one in the wellknown masquerade of their mostdistnguished conjurer , they readily made way for them both 
stll they betrayed no intention to depart 
on the other hand , they were evidently disposed to remain bound to the place by an additional interestin the mystrious mummeries that they of course expected from such a visit 
from the total inability of the scout to addrss the hurons in their own language , he was compelled to trustthe conversation entirely to david 
notwithstnding the simplicity of the latter , he did ample justce to the instuctions he had received , more than fulfilling the stongesthopes of his teacher 
the delawares are women 
he exclaimed , addrssing himself to the savage who had a slight understnding of the language in which he spoke 
the yengeese , my foolish countrymen , have told them to take up the tom awk , and stike their fathers in the canadas , and they have forgotten their sex 
does my brother wish to hear  le cerf agile  ask for his petticoats , and see him weep before the hurons , at the stke 
the exclamation hugh 
delivered in a stong tone of assent , announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared 
let him stp aside , and the cunning man will blow upon the dog 
tell it to my brothers 
the huron explained the meaning of david to his fellows , who , in their turn , listned to the project with that sort of satisfaction that their untamed spirits might be expected to find in such a refinement in cruelty 
they drw back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter 
the bear , instad of obeying , maintained the seat it had taken , and growled  the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers , and take away their courage too , continued david , improving the hint he received 
they muststnd further off 
the hurons , who would have deemed such a misfortune the heaviestcalamity that could befall them , fell back in a body , taking a position where they were out of earshot , though at the same time they could command a view of the entrance to the lodge 
as if satisfied of their safety , the scout left his position , and slowly entered the place 
it was silent and gloomy , being tenanted solely by the captive , and lighted by the dying embers of a fire , which had been used for the purposed of cookery 
uncas occupied a distnt corner , in a reclining attitude , being rigidly bound , both hands and feet , by stong and painful withes 
when the frightful object firstpresented itself to the young mohican , he did not deign to bestw a single glance on the animal 
the scout , who had left david at the door , to ascertain they were not observed , thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy 
instad of speaking , therefore , he exerted himself to enact one of the antics of the animal he represented 
the young mohican , who at firstbelieved his enemies had sent in a real beastto torment him , and try his nerves , detected in those performances that to heyward had appeared so accurate , certain blemishes , that at once betrayed the counterfeit 
had hawkeye been aware of the low estmation in which the skillful uncas held his representations , he would probably have prolonged the entertainment a little in pique 
the scornful expression of the young man s eye admitted of so many constuctions , that the worthy scout was spared the mortification of such a discovery 
as soon , therefore , as david gave the preconcerted signal , a low hissing sound was heard in the lodge in place of the fierce growlings of the bear 
uncas had casthis body back againstthe wall of the hut and closed his eyes , as if willing to exclude so contemptible and disagreeable an object from his sight 
the moment the noise of the serpent was heard , he arose , and casthis looks on each side of him , bending his head low , and turning it inquiringly in every direction , until his keen eye restd on the shaggy monstr , where it remained riveted , as though fixed by the power of a charm 
again the same sounds were repeated , evidently proceeding from the mouth of the beast once more the eyes of the youth roamed over the interior of the lodge , and returning to the former restng place , he uttered , in a deep , suppressed voice  hawkeye 
cut his bands , said hawkeye to david , who justthen approached them 
the singer did as he was ordered , and uncas found his limbs released 
at the same moment the dred skin of the animal rattled , and presently the scout arose to his feet , in proper person 
the mohican appeared to comprehend the nature of the attempt his friend had made , intuitively , neither tongue nor feature betraying another symptom of surprise 
when hawkeye had casthis shaggy vestent , which was done by simply loosing certain thongs of skin , he drw a long , glittering knife , and put it in the hands of uncas 
the red hurons are without , he said 
let us be ready 
at the same time he laid his finger significantly on another similar weapon , both being the fruits of his prowess among their enemies during the evening 
we will go , said uncas 
whither 
to the tortoises 
they are the childrn of my grandfathers 
ay , lad , said the scout in englisha language he was apt to use when a little abstacted in mind 
the same blood runs in your veins , i believe 
time and distnce has a little changed its color 
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door 
they count six , and this singer is as good as nothing 
the hurons are boastrs , said uncas , scornfully 
their  totem  is a moose , and they run like snails 
the delawares are childrn of the tortoise , and they outstip the deer 
ay , lad , there is truth in what you say 
i doubt not , on a rush , you would pass the whole nation 
in a staight race of two miles , would be in , and get your breath again , afore a knave of them all was within hearing of the other village 
the gift of a white man lies more in his arms than in his legs 
as for myself , i can brain a huron as well as a better man 
when it comes to a race the knaves would prove too much for me 
uncas , who had already approached the door , in readiness to lead the way , now recoiled , and placed himself , once more , in the bottom of the lodge 
hawkeye , who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement , continued speaking more to himself than to his companion 
after all , he said , it is unreasonable to keep one man in bondage to the gifts of another 
uncas , you had better take the lead , while i will put on the skin again , and trustto cunning for want of speed 
the young mohican made no reply , but quietly folded his arms , and leaned his body againstone of the upright post that supported the wall of the hut 
well , said the scout looking up at him , why do you tarry 
there will be time enough for me , as the knaves will give chase to you at first uncas will sty , was the calm reply 
for what 
to fight with his father s brother , and die with the friend of the delawares 
ay , lad , returned hawkeye , squeezing the hand of uncas between his own iron fingers 
twould have been more like a mingo than a mohican had you left me 
i thought i would make the offer , seeing that youth commonly loves life 
well , what can t be done by main courage , in war , mustbe done by circumvention 
put on the skin 
i doubt not you can play the bear nearly as well as myself 
whatever might have been the private opinion of uncas of their respective abilities in this particular , his grave countenance manifestd no opinion of his superiority 
he silently and expeditiously encased himself in the covering of the beast and then awaited such other movements as his more aged companion saw fit to dictate 
now , friend , said hawkeye , addrssing david , an exchange of garments will be a great convenience to you , inasmuch as you are but little accustmed to the makeshifts of the wilderness 
here , take my hunting shirt and cap , and give me your blanket and hat 
you musttrustme with the book and spectacles , as well as the tooter , too 
if we ever meet again , in better times , you shall have all back again , with many thanks into the bargain 
david parted with the several articles named with a readiness that would have done great credit to his liberality , had he not certainly profited , in many particulars , by the exchange 
hawkeye was not long in assuming his borrowed garments 
when his restess eyes were hid behind the glasses , and his head was surmounted by the triangular beaver , as their sttures were not dissimilar , he might readily have passed for the singer , by strlight 
as soon as these dispositions were made , the scout turned to david , and gave him his parting instuctions 
are you much given to cowardice 
he bluntly asked , by way of obtaining a suitable understnding of the whole case before he ventured a prescription 
my pursuits are peaceful , and my temper , i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love , returned david , a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood 
there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord , even in the greateststaits 
your chiefestdanger will be at the moment when the savages find out that they have been deceived 
if you are not then knocked on the head , your being a noncomposser will protect you 
you will then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed 
if you sty , it mustbe to sit down here in the shadow , and take the part of uncas , until such times as the cunning of the indians discover the cheat , when , as i have already said , your times of trial will come 
choose for yourselfto make a rush or tarry here 
even so , said david , firmly 
i will abide in the place of the delaware 
bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf , and this , and more , will i dare in his service 
you have spoken as a man , and like one who , under wiser schooling , would have been brought to better things 
hold your head down , and drw in your legs 
their formation might tell the truth too early 
keep silent as long as may be 
it would be wise , when you do speak , to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings , which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be 
if however , they take your scalp , as i trustand believe they will not , depend on it , uncas and i will not forget the deed , but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trust friends 
hold 
i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge 
should i fall , therefore , seek no victims to my manes , but rather forgive my destoyers 
if you remember them at all , let it be in prayers for the enlightening of their minds , and for their eternal welfare 
the scout hesitated , and appeared to muse 
there is a principle in that , he said , different from the law of the woods 
yet it is fair and noble to reflect upon 
heaving a heavy sigh , probably among the lasthe ever drw in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned , he added  it is what i would wish to practise myself , as one without a cross of blood , though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christan 
god bless you , friend 
i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong , when the matter is duly considered , and keeping eternity before the eyes , though much depends on the natural gifts , and the force of temptation 
saying , the scout returned and shook david cordially by the hand 
after which act of friendship he immediately left the lodge , attended by the new representative of the beast the instnt hawkeye found himself under the observation of the hurons , he drw up his tall form in the rigid manner of david , threw out his arm in the act of keeping time , and commenced what he intended for an imitation of his psalmody 
happily for the success of this delicate adventure , he had to deal with ears but little practised in the concord of sweet sounds , or the miserable effort would infallibly have been detected 
it was necessary to pass within a dangerous proximity of the dark group of the savages , and the voice of the scout grew louder as they drw nigher 
when at the nearestpoint the huron who spoke the english thrustout an arm , and stpped the supposed singingmastr 
the delaware dog 
he said , leaning forward , and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other s features 
is he afraid 
will the hurons hear his groans 
a growl , so exceedingly fierce and natural , proceeded from the beast that the young indian released his hold and strted aside , as if to assure himself that it was not a veritable bear , and no counterfeit , that was rolling before him 
hawkeye , who feared his voice would betray him to his subtle enemies , gladly profited by the interruption , to break out anew in such a burstof musical expression as would , probably , in a more refined stte of society have been termed a grand crash 
among his actual auditors , however , it merely gave him an additional claim to that respect which they never withhold from such as are believed to be the subjects of mental alienation 
the little knot on indians drw back in a body , and suffered , as they thought , the conjurer and his inspired assistnt to proceed 
it required no common exercise of fortitude in uncas and the scout to continue the dignified and deliberate pace they had assumed in passing the lodge 
especially as they immediately perceived that curiosity had so far mastred fear , as to induce the watchers to approach the hut , in order to witness the effect of the incantations 
the leastinjudicious or impatient movement on the part of david might betray them , and time was absolutely necessary to insure the safety of the scout 
the loud noise the latter conceived it politic to continue , drw many curious gazers to the doors of the different huts as thy passed 
once or twice a dark looking warrior stpped across their path , led to the act by supersttion and watchfulness 
they were not , however , interrupted , the darkness of the hour , and the boldness of the attempt , proving their principal friends 
the adventurers had got clear of the village , and were now swiftly approaching the shelter of the woods , when a loud and long cry arose from the lodge where uncas had been confined 
the mohican strted on his feet , and shook his shaggy covering , as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort 
hold 
twas nothing but wonderment 
he had no occasion to delay , for at the next instnt a burstof cries filled the outer air , and ran along the whole extent of the village 
uncas casthis skin , and stpped forth in his own beautiful proportions 
hawkeye tapped him lightly on the shoulder , and glided  ead 
now let the devils stike our scent 
two , at least will find it to their deaths 
throwing their pieces to a low trail , like sportsmen in readiness for their game , they dashed forward , and were soon buried in the somber darkness of the forest chapter 27 ant 
i shall remember  when c‘sar says do this , it is performed 
julius caesar the impatience of the savages who lingered about the prison of uncas , as has been seen , had overcome their drad of the conjurer s breath 
they stle cautiously , and with beating hearts , to a crevice , through which the faint light of the fire was glimmering 
for several minutes they mistok the form of david for that of the prisoner 
the very accident which hawkeye had foreseen occurred 
tired of keeping the extremities of his long person so near together , the singer gradually suffered the lower limbs to extend themselves , until one of his misshapen feet actually came in contact with and shoved aside the embers of the fire 
at firstthe hurons believed the delaware had been thus deformed by witchcraft 
when david , unconscious of being observed , turned his head , and exposed his simple , mild countenance , in place of the haughty lineaments of their prisoner , it would have exceeded the credulity of even a native to have doubted any longer 
they rushed together into the lodge , and , laying their hands , with but little ceremony , on their captive , immediately detected the imposition 
they arose the cry firstheard by the fugitives 
it was succeeded by the mostfrantic and angry demonstations of vengeance 
david , however , firm in his determination to cover the retreat of his friends , was compelled to believe that his own final hour had come 
deprived of his book and his pipe , he was fain to trustto a memory that rarely failed him on such subjects 
breaking forth in a loud and impassioned stain , he endeavored to smooth his passage into the other world by singing the opening verse of a funeral anthem 
the indians were seasonably reminded of his infirmity , and , rushing into the open air , they aroused the village in the manner described 
a native warrior fights as he sleeps , without the protection of anything defensive 
the sounds of the alarm were , therefore , hardly uttered before two hundrd men were afoot , and ready for the battle or the chase , as either might be required 
the escape was soon known 
the whole tribe crowded , in a body , around the councillodge , impatiently awaiting the instuction of their chiefs 
in such a sudden demand on their wisdom , the presence of the cunning magua could scarcely fail of being needed 
his name was mentioned , and all looked round in wonder that he did not appear 
messengers were then despatched to his lodge requiring his presence 
in the meantime , some of the swiftestand mostdiscreet of the young men were ordered to make the circuit of the clearing , under cover of the woods , in order to ascertain that their suspected neighbors , the delawares , designed no mischief 
women and childrn ran to and fro 
in short , the whole encampment exhibited another scene of wild and savage confusion 
gradually , however , these symptoms of disorder diminished 
in a few minutes the oldestand mostdistnguished chiefs were assembled in the lodge , in grave consultation 
the clamor of many voices soon announced that a party approached , who might be expected to communicate some intelligence that would explain the mystry of the novel surprise 
the crowd without gave way , and several warriors entered the place , bringing with them the hapless conjurer , who had been left so long by the scout in duress 
notwithstnding this man was held in very unequal estmation among the hurons , some believing implicitly in his power , and others deeming him an impostr , he was now listned to by all with the deepestattention 
when his brief stry was ended , the father of the sick woman stpped forth , and , in a few pithy expression , related , in his turn , what he knew 
these two narratives gave a proper direction to the subsequent inquiries , which were now made with the characteristc cunning of savages 
instad of rushing in a confused and disorderly throng to the cavern , ten of the wisestand firmestamong the chiefs were selected to prosecute the investgation 
as no time was to be lost the instnt the choice was made the individuals appointed rose in a body and left the place without speaking 
on reaching the entrance , the younger men in advance made way for their seniors 
the whole proceeded along the low , dark gallery , with the firmness of warriors ready to devote themselves to the public good , though , at the same time , secretly doubting the nature of the power with which they were about to contend 
the outer apartment of the cavern was silent and gloomy 
the woman lay in her usual place and postre , though there were those present who affirmed they had seen her borne to the woods by the supposed medicine of the white men 
such a direct and palpable contradiction of the tale related by the father caused all eyes to be turned on him 
chafed by the silent imputation , and inwardly troubled by so unaccountable a circumstnce , the chief advanced to the side of the bed , and , stoping , castan incredulous look at the features , as if distustng their reality 
his daughter was dead 
the unerring feeling of nature for a moment prevailed and the old warrior hid his eyes in sorrow 
recovering his selfpossession , he faced his companions , and , pointing toward the corpse , he said , in the language of his people  the wife of my young man has left us 
the great spirit is angry with his childrn 
the mournful intelligence was received in solemn silence 
after a short pause , one of the elder indians was about to speak , when a darklooking object was seen rolling out of an adjoining apartment , into the very center of the room where they stod 
ignorant of the nature of the beings they had to deal with , the whole party drw back a little , and , rising on end , exhibited the distrted but stll fierce and sullen features of magua 
the discovery was succeeded by a general exclamation of amazement 
as soon , however , as the true situation of the chief was understod , several knives appeared , and his limbs and tongue were quickly released 
the huron arose , and shook himself like a lion quitting his lair 
not a word escaped him , though his hand played convulsively with the handle of his knife , while his lowering eyes scanned the whole party , as if they sought an object suited to the firstburstof his vengeance 
it was happy for uncas and the scout , and even david , that they were all beyond the reach of his arm at such a moment 
for , assuredly , no refinement in cruelty would then have deferred their deaths , in opposition to the promptings of the fierce temper that nearly choked him 
meeting everywhere faces that he knew as friends , the savage grated his teeth together like rasps of iron , and swallowed his passion for want of a victim on whom to vent it 
this exhibition of anger was noted by all present 
from an apprehension of exasperating a temper that was already chafed nearly to madness , several minutes were suffered to pass before another word was uttered 
when , however , suitable time had elapsed , the oldestof the party spoke 
my friend has found an enemy , he said 
is he nigh that the hurons might take revenge 
let the delaware die 
exclaimed magua , in a voice of thunder 
another longer and expressive silence was observed , and was broken , as before , with due precaution , by the same individual 
the mohican is swift of foot , and leaps far , he said 
my young men are on his trail 
is he gone 
demanded magua , in tones so deep and guttural , that they seemed to proceed from his inmostchest an evil spirit has been among us , and the delaware has blinded our eyes 
an evil spirit 
repeated the other , mockingly 
tis the spirit that has taken the lives of so many hurons 
the spirit that slew my young men at  the tumbling river  
that took their scalps at the  healing spring  
who has , now , bound the arms of le renard subtil 
of whom does my friend speak 
of the dog who carries the heart and cunning of a huron under a pale skinla longue carabine 
the pronunciation of so terrible a name produced the usual effect among his auditors 
when time was given for reflection , and the warriors remembered that their formidable and daring enemy had even been in the bosom of their encampment , working injury , fearful rage took the place of wonder , and all those fierce passions with which the bosom of magua had justbeen stuggling were suddenly transferred to his companions 
me among them gnashed their teeth in anger , others vented their feelings in yells , and some , again , beat the air as frantically as if the object of their resentment were suffering under their blows 
this sudden outbreaking of temper as quickly subsided in the stll and sullen restaint they mostaffected in their moments of inaction 
magua , who had in his turn found leisure for reflection , now changed his manner , and assumed the air of one who knew how to think and act with a dignity worthy of so grave a subject 
let us go to my people , he said 
they wait for us 
his companions consented in silence , and the whole of the savage party left the cavern and returned to the council lodge 
when they were seated , all eyes turned on magua , who understod , from such an indication , that , by common consent , they had devolved the duty of relating what had passed on him 
he arose , and told his tale without duplicity or reservation 
the whole deception practised by both duncan and hawkeye was , of course , laid naked , and no room was found , even for the mostsupersttious of the tribe , any longer to affix a doubt on the character of the occurrences 
it was but too apparent that they had been insultingly , shamefully , disgracefully deceived 
when he had ended , and resumed his seat , the collected tribefor his auditors , in substnce , included all the fighting men of the partysat regarding each other like men astnished equally at the audacity and the success of their enemies 
the next consideration , however , was the means and opportunities for revenge 
additional pursuers were sent on the trail of the fugitives 
then the chiefs applied themselves , in earnest to the business of consultation 
many different expedients were proposed by the elder warriors , in succession , to all of which magua was a silent and respectful listner 
that subtle savage had recovered his artifice and selfcommand , and now proceeded toward his object with his custmary caution and skill 
it was only when each one disposed to speak had uttered his sentiments , that he prepared to advance his own opinions 
they were given with additional weight from the circumstnce that some of the runners had already returned , and reported that their enemies had been traced so far as to leave no doubt of their having sought safety in the neighboring camp of their suspected allies , the delawares 
with the advantage of possessing this important intelligence , the chief warily laid his plans before his fellows , and , as might have been anticipated from his eloquence and cunning , they were adopted without a dissenting voice 
they were , briefly , as follows , both in opinions and in motives 
it has been already stted that , in obedience to a policy rarely departed from , the sistrs were separated so soon as they reached the huron village 
magua had early discovered that in retaining the person of alice , he possessed the mosteffectual check on cora 
when they parted , therefore , he kept the former within reach of his hand , consigning the one he mostvalued to the keeping of their allies 
the arrangement was understod to be merely temporary , and was made as much with a view to flatter his neighbors as in obedience to the invariable rule of indian policy 
while goaded incessantly by these revengeful impulses that in a savage seldom slumber , the chief was stll attentive to his more permanent personal interest 
the follies and disloyalty committed in his youth were to be expiated by a long and painful penance , ere he could be restred to the full enjoyment of the confidence of his ancient people 
without confidence there could be no authority in an indian tribe 
in this delicate and arduous situation , the crafty native had neglected no means of increasing his influence 
one of the happiestof his expedients had been the success with which he had cultivated the favor of their powerful and dangerous neighbors 
the result of his experiment had answered all the expectations of his policy 
for the hurons were in no degree exempt from that governing principle of nature , which induces man to value his gifts precisely in the degree that they are appreciated by others 
while he was making this ostnsible sacrifice to general considerations , magua never lostsight of his individual motives 
the latter had been frustated by the unlookedfor events which had placed all his prisoners beyond his control 
he now found himself reduced to the necessity of suing for favors to those whom it had so lately been his policy to oblige 
several of the chiefs had proposed deep and treacherous schemes to surprise the delawares and , by gaining possession of their camp , to recover their prisoners by the same blow 
for all agreed that their honor , their interest , and the peace and happiness of their dead countrymen , imperiously required them speedily to immolate some victims to their revenge 
plans so dangerous to attempt , and of such doubtful issue , magua found little difficulty in defeating 
he exposed their risk and fallacy with his usual skill 
it was only after he had removed every impediment , in the shape of opposing advice , that he ventured to propose his own projects 
he commenced by flattering the selflove of his auditors 
a neverfailing method of commanding attention 
when he had enumerated the many different occasions on which the hurons had exhibited their courage and prowess , in the punishment of insults , he digressed in a high encomium on the virtue of wisdom 
he painted the quality as forming the great point of difference between the beaver and other brutes 
between the brutes and men 
finally , between the hurons , in particular , and the restof the human race 
after he had sufficiently extolled the property of discretion , he undertook to exhibit in what manner its use was applicable to the present situation of their tribe 
on the one hand , he said , was their great pale father , the governor of the canadas , who had looked upon his childrn with a hard eye since their tom awks had been so red 
on the other , a people as numerous as themselves , who spoke a different language , possessed different interest , and loved them not , and who would be glad of any pretense to bring them in disgrace with the great white chief 
he spoke of their necessities 
of the gifts they had a right to expect for their pastservices 
of their distnce from their proper huntinggrounds and native villages 
of the necessity of consulting prudence more , and inclination less , in so critical circumstnces 
when he perceived that , while the old men applauded his moderation , many of the fiercestand mostdistnguished of the warriors listned to these politic plans with lowering looks , he cunningly led them back to the subject which they mostloved 
he spoke openly of the fruits of their wisdom , which he boldly pronounced would be a complete and final triumph over their enemies 
he even darkly hinted that their success might be extended , with proper caution , in such a manner as to include the destuction of all whom they had reason to hate 
in short , he so blended the warlike with the artful , the obvious with the obscure , as to flatter the propensities of both parties , and to leave to each subject of hope , while neither could say it clearly comprehended his intentions 
the orator , or the politician , who can produce such a stte of things , is commonly popular with his contemporaries , however he may be treated by postrity 
all perceived that more was meant than was uttered , and each one believed that the hidden meaning was precisely such as his own faculties enabled him to understnd , or his own wishes led him to anticipate 
in this happy stte of things , it is not surprising that the management of magua prevailed 
the tribe consented to act with deliberation , and with one voice they committed the direction of the whole affair to the government of the chief who had suggestd such wise and intelligible expedients 
magua had now attained one great object of all his cunning and enterprise 
the ground he had lostin the favor of his people was completely regained , and he found himself even placed at the head of affairs 
he was , in truth , their ruler 
so long as he could maintain his popularity , no monarch could be more despotic , especially while the tribe continued in a hostle country 
throwing off , therefore , the appearance of consultation , he assumed the grave air of authority necessary to support the dignity of his office 
runners were despatched for intelligence in different directions 
spies were ordered to approach and feel the encampment of the delawares 
the warriors were dismissed to their lodges , with an intimation that their services would soon be needed 
the women and childrn were ordered to retire , with a warning that it was their province to be silent 
when these several arrangements were made , magua passed through the village , stpping here and there to pay a visit where he thought his presence might be flattering to the individual 
he confirmed his friends in their confidence , fixed the wavering , and gratified all 
he sought his own lodge 
the wife the huron chief had abandoned , when he was chased from among his people , was dead 
childrn he had none 
he now occupied a hut , without companion of any sort 
it was , in fact , the dilapidated and solitary stucture in which david had been discovered , and whom he had tolerated in his presence , on those few occasions when they met , with the contemptuous indifference of a haughty superiority 
hither , then , magua retired , when his labors of policy were ended 
while others slept , however , he neither knew or sought repose 
had there been one sufficiently curious to have watched the movements of the newly elected chief , he would have seen him seated in a corner of his lodge , musing on the subject of his future plans , from the hour of his retirement to the time he had appointed for the warriors to assemble again 
occasionally the air breathed through the crevices of the hut , and the low flame that fluttered about the embers of the fire threw their wavering light on the person of the sullen recluse 
at such moments it would not have been difficult to have fancied the dusky savage the prince of darkness brooding on his own fancied wrongs , and plotting evil 
long before the day dawned , however , warrior after warrior entered the solitary hut of magua , until they had collected to the number of twenty 
each bore his rifle , and all the other accouterments of war , though the paint was uniformly peaceful 
the entrance of these fiercelooking beings was unnoticed  some seating themselves in the shadows of the place , and others stnding like motionless sttues , until the whole of the designated band was collected 
magua arose and gave the signal to proceed , marching himself in advance 
they followed their leader singly , and in that wellknown order which has obtained the distnguishing appellation of indian file 
unlike other men engaged in the spiritstrring business of war , they stle from their camp unostntatiously and unobserved resembling a band of gliding specters , more than warriors seeking the bubble reputation by deeds of desperate daring 
instad of taking the path which led directly toward the camp of the delawares , magua led his party for some distnce down the windings of the steam , and along the little artificial lake of the beavers 
the day began to dawn as they entered the clearing which had been formed by those sagacious and industious animals 
though magua , who had resumed his ancient garb , bore the outline of a fox on the drssed skin which formed his robe , there was one chief of his party who carried the beaver as his peculiar symbol , or totem 
there would have been a species of profanity in the omission , had this man passed so powerful a community of his fancied kindrd , without bestwing some evidence of his regard 
accordingly , he paused , and spoke in words as kind and friendly as if he were addrssing more intelligent beings 
he called the animals his cousins , and reminded them that his protecting influence was the reason they remained unharmed , while many avaricious traders were prompting the indians to take their lives 
he promised a continuance of his favors , and admonished them to be grateful 
after which , he spoke of the expedition in which he was himself engaged , and intimated , though with sufficient delicacy and circumlocution , the expediency of bestwing on their relative a portion of that wisdom for the indians 
they often addrss their victims in this way , reproaching them for cowardice or commending their resolution , as they may happen to exhibit fortitude or the reverse , in suffering 
during the utterance of this extraordinary addrss , the companions of the speaker were as grave and as attentive to his language as though they were all equally impressed with its propriety 
once or twice black objects were seen rising to the surface of the water , and the huron expressed pleasure , conceiving that his words were not bestwed in vain 
justas he ended his addrss , the head of a large beaver was thrustfrom the door of a lodge , whose earthen walls had been much injured , and which the party had believed , from its situation , to be uninhabited 
such an extraordinary sign of confidence was received by the orator as a highly favorable omen 
though the animal retreated a little precipitately , he was lavish of his thanks and commendations 
when magua thought sufficient time had been lostin gratifying the family affection of the warrior , he again made the signal to proceed 
as the indians moved away in a body , and with a stp that would have been inaudible to the ears of any common man , the same venerablelooking beaver once more ventured his head from its cover 
had any of the hurons turned to look behind them , they would have seen the animal watching their movements with an interestand sagacity that might easily have been mistken for reason 
indeed , so very distnct and intelligible were the devices of the quadrped , that even the mostexperienced observer would have been at a loss to account for its actions , until the moment when the party entered the forest when the whole would have been explained , by seeing the entire animal issue from the lodge , uncasing , by the act , the grave features of chingachgook from his mask of fur 
chapter 28 brief , i pray for you 
for you see ,  tis a busy time with me 
much ado about nothing the tribe , or rather half tribe , of delawares , which has been so often mentioned , and whose present place of encampment was so nigh the temporary village of the hurons , could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people 
like their neighbors , they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown , and were making heavy and serious inroads on the huntinggrounds of the mohawks 
though they had seen fit , with the mystrious reserve so common among the natives , to withhold their assistnce at the moment when it was mostrequired 
the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of their ally in various ways 
it was the prevalent opinion , however , that they had been influenced by veneration for the ancient treaty , that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection , and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former mastrs 
as for the tribe itself , it had been content to announce to montcalm , through his emissaries , with indian brevity , that their hatchets were dull , and time was necessary to sharpen them 
the politic captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend , than by any acts of illjudged severity to convert him into an open enemy 
on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forest , in the manner described , the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burstupon a busy people , actively employed in all the custmary avocations of high noon 
the women ran from lodge to lodge , some engaged in preparing their morning s meal , a few earnesty bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits , but more pausing to exchange hast and whispered sentences with their friends 
the warriors were lounging in groups , musing more than they conversed and when a few words were uttered , speaking like men who deeply weighed their opinions 
the instuments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges 
none departed 
here and there a warrior was examining his arms , with an attention that is rarely bestwed on the implements , when no other enemy than the beast of the forestis expected to be encountered 
occasionally , the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously toward a large and silent lodge in the center of the village , as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts 
during the existnce of this scene , a man suddenly appeared at the furthestextremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village 
he was without arms , and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural strnness of his austre countenance 
when in full view of the delawares he stpped , and made a gestre of amity , by throwing his arm upward toward heaven , and then letting it fall impressively on his breast  the inhabitants of the village answered his salute by a low murmur of welcome , and encouraged him to advance by similar indications of friendship 
fortified by these assurances , the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace , where it had stod a moment , drwn in a stong outline againstthe blushing morning sky , and moved with dignity into the very center of the huts 
as he approached , nothing was audible but the rattling of the light silver ornaments that loaded his arms and neck , and the tinkling of the little bells that fringed his deerskin moccasins 
he made , as he advanced , many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed , neglecting to notice the women , however , like one who deemed their favor , in the present enterprise , of no importance 
when he had reached the group in which it was evident , by the haughtiness of their common mien , that the principal chiefs were collected , the stanger paused , and then the delawares saw that the active and erect form that stod before them was that of the wellknown huron chief , le renard subtil 
his reception was grave , silent , and wary 
the warriors in front stpped aside , opening the way to their mostapproved orator by the action 
one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines 
the wise huron is welcome , said the delaware , in the with his brothers of the lakes 
much used also by the whites 
by corn is meant maise 
he is come , repeated magua , bending his head with the dignity of an eastrn prince 
the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist they once more exchanged friendly salutations 
the delaware invited his guestto enter his own lodge , and share his morning meal 
the invitation was accepted 
the two warriors , attended by three or four of the old men , walked calmly away , leaving the restof the tribe devoured by a desire to understnd the reasons of so unusual a visit , and yet not betraying the leastimpatience by sign or word 
during the short and frugal repastthat followed , the conversation was extremely circumspect , and related entirely to the events of the hunt , in which magua had so lately been engaged 
it would have been impossible for the mostfinished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course , than did his host , notwithstnding every individual present was perfectly aware that it mustbe connected with some secret object and that probably of importance to themselves 
when the appetites of the whole were appeased , the squaws removed the trenchers and gourds , and the two parties began to prepare themselves for a subtle trial of their wits 
is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron childrn 
demanded the orator of the delawares 
when was it ever otherwise 
returned magua 
he calls my people  mostbeloved  
the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false , and continued  the tom awks of your young men have been very red 
it is so 
they are now bright and dull 
for the yengeese are dead , and the delawares are our neighbors 
the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gestre of the hand , and remained silent 
magua , as if recalled to such a recollection , by the allusion to the massacre , demanded  does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers 
she is welcome 
the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open 
let her be sent to my squaws , if she gives trouble to my brother 
she is welcome , returned the chief of the latter nation , stll more emphatically 
the baffled magua continued silent several minutes , apparently indifferent , however , to the repulse he had received in this his opening effort to regain possession of cora 
do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their hunts 
he at length continued 
the lenape are rulers of their own hills , returned the other a little haughtily 
it is well 
justce is the mastr of a redskin 
why should they brighten their tom awks and sharpen their knives againsteach other 
are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers 
good 
exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time 
magua waited a little , to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares , before he added  have there not been stange moccasins in the woods 
have not my brothers scented the feet of white men 
let my canada father come , returned the other , evasively 
his childrn are ready to see him 
when the great chief comes , it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams 
the hurons say , too , he is welcome 
the yengeese have long arms , and legs that never tire 
my young men dramed they had seen the trail of the yengeese nigh the village of the delawares 
they will not find the lenape asleep 
it is well 
the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy , said magua , once more shifting his ground , when he found himself unable to penetrate the caution of his companion 
i have brought gifts to my brother 
his nation would not go on the warpath , because they did not think it well , but their friends have remembered where they lived 
when he had thus announced his liberal intention , the crafty chief arose , and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his host 
they consistd principally of trinkets of little value , plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry 
in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection 
while he bestwed those of greater value on the two mostdistnguished warriors , one of whom was his host he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors with such well timed and apposite compliments , as left them no ground of complaint 
in short , the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering , that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity so aptly mingled with praise , in the eyes of those he addrssed 
this welljudged and politic stoke on the part of magua was not without instntaneous results 
the delawares losttheir gravity in a much more cordial expression 
the host in particular , after contemplating his own liberal share of the spoil for some moments with peculiar gratification , repeated with stong emphasis , the words  my brother is a wise chief 
he is welcome 
the hurons love their friends the delawares , returned magua 
why should they not 
they are colored by the same sun , and their justmen will hunt in the same grounds after death 
the redskins should be friends , and look with open eyes on the white men 
has not my brother scented spies in the woods 
the delaware , whose name in english signified hard heart , an appellation that the french had translated into le coeur dur , forgot that obduracy of purpose , which had probably obtained him so significant a title 
his countenance grew very sensibly less strn and he now deigned to answer more directly 
there have been stange moccasins about my camp 
they have been tracked into my lodges 
did my brother beat out the dogs 
asked magua , without adverting in any manner to the former equivocation of the chief 
it would not do 
the stanger is always welcome to the childrn of the lenape 
the stanger , but not the spy 
would the yengeese send their women as spies 
did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle 
he told no lie 
the yengeese have sent out their scouts 
they have been in my wigwams , but they found there no one to say welcome 
they fled to the delawaresfor , say they , the delawares are our friends 
their minds are turned from their canada father 
this insinuation was a home thrust and one that in a more advanced stte of society would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist  the recent defection of the tribe had , as they well knew themselves , subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies 
they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distust  there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements 
their distnt villages , their huntinggrounds and hundrds of their women and childrn , together with a material part of their physical force , were actually within the limits of the french territory 
accordingly , this alarming annunciation was received , as magua intended , with manifestdisapprobation , if not with alarm 
let my father look in my face , said le coeurdur 
he will see no change 
it is true , my young men did not go out on the warpath 
they had drams for not doing so 
they love and venerate the great white chief 
will he think so when he hears that his greatestenemy is fed in the camp of his childrn 
when he is told a bloody yengee smokes at your fire 
that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delawares 
go 
my great canada father is not a fool 
where is the yengee that the delawares fear 
returned the other 
who has slain my young men 
who is the mortal enemy of my great father 
la longue carabine 
the delaware warriors strted at the wellknown name , betraying by their amazement , that they now learned , for the firsttime , one so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power 
what does my brother mean 
demanded le coeurdur , in a tone that , by its wonder , far exceeded the usual apathy of his race 
a huron never lies 
returned magua , coldly , leaning his head againstthe side of the lodge , and drwing his slight robe across his tawny breast  let the delawares count their prisoners 
they will find one whose skin is neither red nor pale 
a long and musing pause succeeded 
the chief consulted apart with his companions , and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the mostdistnguished men of the tribe 
as warrior after warrior drpped in , they were each made acquainted , in turn , with the important intelligence that magua had justcommunicated 
the air of surprise , and the usual low , deep , guttural exclamation , were common to them all 
the news spread from mouth to mouth , until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated 
the women suspended their labors , to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors 
the boys deserted their sports , and walking fearlessly among their fathers , looked up in curious admiration , as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the temerity of their hated foe 
in short , every occupation was abandoned for the time , and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge , after their own peculiar manner , in an open expression of feeling 
when the excitement had a little abated , the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform , under circumstnces of so much delicacy and embarrassment 
during all these movements , and in the midstof the general commotion , magua had not only maintained his seat , but the very attitude he had originally taken , againstthe side of the lodge , where he continued as immovable , and , apparently , as unconcerned , as if he had no interestin the result 
not a single indication of the future intentions of his host , however , escaped his vigilant eyes 
with his consummate knowledge of the nature of the people with whom he had to deal , he anticipated every measure on which they decided 
it might almostbe said , that , in many instnces , he knew their intentions , even before they became known to themselves 
the council of the delawares was short 
when it was ended , a general buste announced that it was to be immediately succeeded by a solemn and formal assemblage of the nation 
as such meetings were rare , and only called on occasions of the lastimportance , the subtle huron , who stll sat apart , a wily and dark observer of the proceedings , now knew that all his projects mustbe brought to their final issue 
he , therefore , left the lodge and walked silently forth to the place , in front of the encampment , whither the warriors were already beginning to collect 
it might have been half an hour before each individual , including even the women and childrn , was in his place 
the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference 
when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain , againstwhose bosom the delawares had constucted their encampment , mostwere seated 
as his bright rays darted from behind the outline of trees that fringed the eminence , they fell upon as grave , as attentive , and as deeply interestd a multitude , as was probably ever before lighted by his morning beams 
its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls 
in a collection of so serious savages , there is never to be found any impatient aspirant after premature distnction , stnding ready to move his auditors to some hast , and , perhaps , injudicious discussion , in order that his own reputation may be the gainer 
an act of so much precipitancy and presumption would seal the downfall of precocious intellect forever 
it restd solely with the oldestand mostexperienced of the men to lay the subject of the conference before the people 
until such a one chose to make some movement , no deeds in arms , no natural gifts , nor any renown as an orator , would have justfied the slightestinterruption 
on the present occasion , the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak , was silent , seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject 
the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause that always preceded a conference 
no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngestboy 
occasionally an eye was raised from the earth , where the looks of mostwere riveted , and stayed toward a particular lodge , that was , however , in no manner distnguished from those around it , except in the peculiar care that had been taken to protect it againstthe assaults of the weather 
at length one of those low murmurs , that are so apt to distrb a multitude , was heard , and the whole nation arose to their feet by a common impulse 
at that instnt the door of the lodge in queston opened , and three men , issuing from it , slowly approached the place of consultation 
they were all aged , even beyond that period to which the oldestpresent had reached 
one in the center , who leaned on his companions for support , had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain 
his frame , which had once been tall and erect , like the cedar , was now bending under the pressure of more than a century 
the elastc , light stp of an indian was gone , and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground , inch by inch 
his dark , wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrastwith the long white locks which floated on his shoulders , in such thickness , as to announce that generations had probably passed away since they had lastbeen shorn 
the drss of this patriarchfor such , considering his vastage , in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people , he might very properly be termedwas rich and imposing , though stictly after the simple fashions of the tribe 
his robe was of the finestskins , which had been deprived of their fur , in order to admit of a hieroglyphical representation of various deeds in arms , done in former ages 
his bosom was loaded with medals , some in massive silver , and one or two even in gold , the gifts of various christan potentates during the long period of his life 
he also wore armlets , and cinctures above the ankles , of the latter precious metal 
his head , on the whole of which the hair had been permitted to grow , the pursuits of war having so long been abandoned , was encircled by a sort of plated diadem , which , in its turn , bore lesser and more glittering ornaments , that sparkled amid the glossy hues of three droping ostich feathers , dyed a deep black , in touching contrastto the color of his snowwhite locks 
his tom awk was nearly hid in silver , and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold 
soon as the firsthum of emotion and pleasure , which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created , had a little subsided , the name of tamenund was whispered from mouth to mouth 
magua had often heard the fame of this wise and justdelaware 
a reputation that even proceeded so far as to bestw on him the rare gift of holding secret communion with the great spirit , and which has since transmitted his name , with some slight alteration , to the white usurpers of his ancient territory , as the imaginary therefore , stpped eagerly out a little from the throng , to a spot whence he might catch a nearer glimpse of the features of the man , whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes 
tamenay , a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced 
there are many traditions which speak of the character and power of tamenund 
the eyes of the old man were closed , as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions 
the color of his skin differed from that of mostaround him , being richer and darker , the latter having been produced by certain delicate and mazy lines of complicated and yet beautiful figures , which had been traced over mostof his person by the operation of tattooing 
notwithstnding the position of the huron , he passed the observant and silent magua without notice , and leaning on his two venerable supporters proceeded to the high place of the multitude , where he seated himself in the center of his nation , with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father 
nothing could surpass the reverence and affection with which this unexpected visit from one who belongs rather to another world than to this , was received by his people 
after a suitable and decent pause , the principal chiefs arose , and , approaching the patriarch , they placed his hands reverently on their heads , seeming to entreat a blessing 
the younger men were content with touching his robe , or even drwing nigh his person , in order to breathe in the atmosphere of one so aged , so just and so valiant 
none but the mostdistnguished among the youthful warriors even presumed to far as to perform the latter ceremony , the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness to look upon a form so deeply venerated , and so well beloved 
when these acts of affection and respect were performed , the chiefs drw back again to their several places , and silence reigned in the whole encampment 
after a short delay , a few of the young men , to whom instuctions had been whispered by one of the aged attendants of tamenund , arose , left the crowd , and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning 
in a few minutes they reappeared , escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment 
the crowd opened in a lane 
when the party had re entered , it closed in again , forming a large and dense belt of human bodies , arranged in an open circle 
chapter 29 the assembly seated , rising o er the rest achilles thus the king of men addrssed 
pope s illiad cora stod foremostamong the prisoners , entwining her arms in those of alice , in the tenderness of sistrly love 
notwithstnding the fearful and menacing array of savages on every side of her , no apprehension on her own account could prevent the noblerminded maiden from keeping her eyes fastned on the pale and anxious features of the trembling alice 
close at their side stod heyward , with an interestin both , that , at such a moment of intense uncertainty , scarcely knew a preponderance in favor of her whom he mostloved 
hawkeye had placed himself a little in the rear , with a deference to the superior rank of his companions , that no similarity in the stte of their present fortunes could induce him to forget 
uncas was not there 
when perfect silence was again restred , and after the usual long , impressive pause , one of the two aged chiefs who sat at the side of the patriarch arose , and demanded aloud , in very intelligible english  which of my prisoners is la longue carabine 
neither duncan nor the scout answered 
the former , however , glanced his eyes around the dark and silent assembly , and recoiled a pace , when they fell on the malignant visage of magua 
he saw , at once , that this wily savage had some secret agency in their present arraignment before the nation , and determined to throw every possible impediment in the way of the execution of his sinistr plans 
he had witnessed one instnce of the summary punishments of the indians , and now draded that his companion was to be selected for a second 
in this dilemma , with little or no time for reflection , he suddenly determined to cloak his invaluable friend , at any or every hazard to himself 
before he had time , however , to speak , the queston was repeated in a louder voice , and with a clearer utterance 
give us arms , the young man haughtily replied , and place us in yonder woods 
our deeds shall speak for us 
this is the warrior whose name has filled our ears 
returned the chief , regarding heyward with that sort of curious interestwhich seems inseparable from man , when firstbeholding one of his fellows to whom merit or accident , virtue or crime , has given notoriety 
what has brought the white man into the camp of the delawares 
my necessities 
i come for food , shelter , and friends 
it cannot be 
the woods are full of game 
the head of a warrior needs no other shelter than a sky without clouds 
the delawares are the enemies , and not the friends of the yengeese 
go , the mouth has spoken , while the heart said nothing 
duncan , a little at a loss in what manner to proceed , remained silent 
the scout , who had listned attentively to all that passed , now advanced stadily to the front 
that i did not answer to the call for la longue carabine , was not owing either to shame or fear , he said , for neither one nor the other is the gift of an honestman 
i do not admit the right of the mingoes to bestw a name on one whose friends have been mindful of his gifts , in this particular 
especially as their title is a lie ,  killdeer  being a grooved barrel and no carabyne 
i am the man , however , that got the name of nathaniel from my kin 
the compliment of hawkeye from the delawares , who live on their own river 
whom the iroquois have presumed to stle the  long rifle  , without any warranty from him who is mostconcerned in the matter 
the eyes of all present , which had hitherto been gravely scanning the person of duncan , were now turned , on the instnt , toward the upright iron frame of this new pretender to the distnguished appellation 
it was in no degree remarkable that there should be found two who were willing to claim so great an honor , for impostrs , though rare , were not unknown among the natives 
it was altogether material to the justand severe intentions of the delawares , that there should be no mistke in the matter 
me of their old men consulted together in private , and then , as it would seem , they determined to interrogate their visitor on the subject 
my brother has said that a snake crept into my camp , said the chief to magua 
which is he 
the huron pointed to the scout 
will a wise delaware believe the barking of a wolf 
exclaimed duncan , stll more confirmed in the evil intentions of his ancient enemy   a dog never lies , but when was a wolf known to speak the truth 
the eyes of magua flashed fire 
suddenly recollecting the necessity of maintaining his presence of mind , he turned away in silent disdain , well assured that the sagacity of the indians would not fail to extract the real merits of the point in controversy 
he was not deceived 
for , after another short consultation , the wary delaware turned to him again , and expressed the determination of the chiefs , though in the mostconsiderate language 
my brother has been called a liar , he said , and his friends are angry 
they will show that he has spoken the truth 
give my prisoners guns , and let them prove which is the man 
magua affected to consider the expedient , which he well knew proceeded from distustof himself , as a compliment , and made a gestre of acquiescence , well content that his veracity should be supported by so skillful a marksman as the scout 
the weapons were instntly placed in the hands of the friendly opponents , and they were bid to fire , over the heads of the seated multitude , at an earthen vessel , which lay , by accident , on a stmp , some fifty yards from the place where they stod 
heyward smiled to himself at the idea of a competition with the scout , though he determined to persevere in the deception , until apprised of the real designs of magua 
raising his rifle with the utmostcare , and renewing his aim three several times , he fired 
the bullet cut the wood within a few inches of the vessel 
a general exclamation of satisfaction announced that the shot was considered a proof of great skill in the use of a weapon 
even hawkeye nodded his head , as if he would say , it was better than he expected 
instad of manifestng an intention to contend with the successful marksman , he stod leaning on his rifle for more than a minute , like a man who was completely buried in thought 
from this reverie , he was , however , awakened by one of the young indians who had furnished the arms , and who now touched his shoulder , saying in exceedingly broken english  can the pale face beat it 
yes , huron 
exclaimed the scout , raising the short rifle in his right hand , and shaking it at magua , with as much apparent ease as if it were a reed 
yes , huron , i could stike you now , and no power on earth could prevent the deed 
the soaring hawk is not more certain of the dove than i am this moment of you , did i choose to send a bullet to your heart 
why should i not 
why 
because the gifts of my color forbid it , and i might drw down evil on tender and innocent heads 
if you know such a being as god , thank him , therefore , in your inward soul 
for you have reason 
the flushed countenance , angry eye and swelling figure of the scout , produced a sensation of secret awe in all that heard him 
the delawares held their breath in expectation 
magua himself , even while he distustd the forbearance of his enemy , remained immovable and calm , where he stod wedged in by the crowd , as one who grew to the spot 
beat it , repeated the young delaware at the elbow of the scout 
beat what , fool 
what 
exclaimed hawkeye , stll flourishing the weapon angrily above his head , though his eye no longer sought the person of magua 
if the white man is the warrior he pretends , said the aged chief , let him stike nigher to the mark 
the scout laughed alouda noise that produced the strtling effect of an unnatural sound on heyward 
drpping the piece , heavily , into his extended left hand , it was discharged , apparently by the shock , drving the fragments of the vessel into the air , and scattering them on every side 
almostat the same instnt , the rattling sound of the rifle was heard , as he suffered it to fall , contemptuously , to the earth 
the firstimpression of so stange a scene was engrossing admiration 
a low , but increasing murmur , ran through the multitude , and finally swelled into sounds that denoted a lively opposition in the sentiments of the spectators 
while some openly testfied their satisfaction at so unexampled dexterity , by far the larger portion of the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the shot was the result of accident 
heyward was not slow to confirm an opinion that was so favorable to his own pretensions 
it was chance 
he exclaimed 
none can shoot without an aim 
chance 
echoed the excited woodsman , who was now stbbornly bent on maintaining his identity at every hazard , and on whom the secret hints of heyward to acquiesce in the deception were entirely lost  does yonder lying huron , too , think it chance 
give him another gun , and place us face to face , without cover or dodge , and let providence , and our own eyes , decide the matter atween us 
i do not make the offer , to you , major 
for our blood is of a color , and we serve the same mastr 
that the huron is a liar , is very evident , returned heyward , coolly 
you have yourself heard him asset you to be la longue carabine 
it were impossible to say what violent assertion the stbborn hawkeye would have next made , in his headlong wish to vindicate his identity , had not the aged delaware once more interposed 
the hawk which comes from the clouds can return when he will , he said 
give them the guns 
this time the scout seized the rifle with avidity 
nor had magua , though he watched the movements of the marksman with jealous eyes , any further cause for apprehension 
now let it be proved , in the face of this tribe of delawares , which is the better man , cried the scout , tapping the butt of his piece with that finger which had pulled so many fatal triggers 
you see that gourd hanging againstyonder tree , major 
if you are a marksman fit for the borders , let me see you break its shell 
duncan noted the object , and prepared himself to renew the trial 
the gourd was one of the usual little vessels used by the indians , and it was suspended from a dead branch of a small pine , by a thong of deerskin , at the full distnce of a hundrd yards 
stangely compounded is the feeling of selflove , that the young soldier , while he knew the utter worthlessness of the suffrages of his savage umpires , forgot the sudden motives of the contestin a wish to excel 
it had been seen , already , that his skill was far from being contemptible , and he now resolved to put forth its nicestqualities 
had his life depended on the issue , the aim of duncan could not have been more deliberate or guarded 
he fired 
three or four young indians , who sprang forward at the report , announced with a shout , that the ball was in the tree , a very little on one side of the proper object 
the warriors uttered a common ejaculation of pleasure , and then turned their eyes , inquiringly , on the movements of his rival 
it may do for the royal americans 
had my gun often turned so much from the true line , many a marten , whose skin is now in a lady s muff , would stll be in the woods 
ay , and many a bloody mingo , who has departed to his final account , would be acting his deviltries at this very day , atween the provinces 
i hope the squaw who owns the gourd has more of them in her wigwam , for this will never hold water again 
the scout had shook his priming , and cocked his piece , while speaking 
as he ended , he threw back a foot , and slowly raised the muzzle from the earth  the motion was stady , uniform , and in one direction 
when on a perfect level , it remained for a single moment , without tremor or variation , as though both man and rifle were carved in stne 
during that sttionary instnt , it poured forth its contents , in a bright , glancing sheet of flame 
again the young indians bounded forward 
their hurried search and disappointed looks announced that no traces of the bullet were to be seen 
go 
i will talk to the  long rifle  of the yengeese 

had i that piece which furnished the name you use , i would obligate myself to cut the thong , and drp the gourd without breaking it 
returned hawkeye , perfectly undistrbed by the other s manner 
fools , if you would find the bullet of a sharpshooter in these woods , you mustlook in the object , and not around it 
the indian youths instntly comprehended his meaningfor this time he spoke in the delaware tongueand tearing the gourd from the tree , they held it on high with an exulting shout , displaying a hole in its bottom , which had been but by the bullet , after passing through the usual orifice in the center of its upper side 
at this unexpected exhibition , a loud and vehement expression of pleasure burstfrom the mouth of every warrior present 
it decided the queston , and effectually estblished hawkeye in the possession of his dangerous reputation 
those curious and admiring eyes which had been turned again on heyward , were finally directed to the weatherbeaten form of the scout , who immediately became the principal object of attention to the simple and unsophistcated beings by whom he was surrounded 
when the sudden and noisy commotion had a little subsided , the aged chief resumed his examination 
why did you wish to stp my ears 
he said , addrssing duncan 
are the delawares fools that they could not know the young panther from the cat 
they will yet find the huron a singingbird , said duncan , endeavoring to adopt the figurative language of the natives 
it is good 
we will know who can shut the ears of men 
brother , added the chief turning his eyes on magua , the delawares listn 
thus singled , and directly called on to declare his object , the huron arose 
advancing with great deliberation and dignity into the very center of the circle , where he stod confronted by the prisoners , he placed himself in an attitude to speak 
before opening his mouth , however , he bent his eyes slowly along the whole living boundary of earnestfaces , as if to temper his expressions to the capacities of his audience 
on hawkeye he casta glance of respectful enmity 
on duncan , a look of inextinguishable hatred 
the shrinking figure of alice he scarcely deigned to notice 
when his glance met the firm , commanding , and yet lovely form of cora , his eye lingered a moment , with an expression that it might have been difficult to define 
filled with his own dark intentions , he spoke in the language of the canadas , a tongue that he well knew was comprehended by mostof his auditors 
the spirit that made men colored them differently , commenced the subtle huron 
me are blacker than the sluggish bear 
these he said should be slaves 
he ordered them to work forever , like the beaver 
you may hear them groan , when the south wind blows , louder than the lowing buffaloes , along the shores of the great salt lake , where the big canoes come and go with them in drves 
me he made with faces paler than the ermine of the forest 
these he ordered to be traders 
dogs to their women , and wolves to their slaves 
he gave this people the nature of the pigeon 
wings that never tire 
young , more plentiful than the leaves on the trees , and appetites to devour the earth 
he gave them tongues like the false call of the wildcat 
hearts like rabbits 
the cunning of the hog  sleep and waking

ten questons , and no epicharmos of kos 
no examination paper asks everything , and this one did ask a good deal 
bertie and billy wrote the full time allotted , and found that they could have filled an hour more without coming to the end of their thoughts 
comparing notes at lunch , their information was discovered to have been lacking here and there 
nevertheless , it was no failure 
their inner convictions were sure of fifty per cent at least and this was all they asked of the gods 
i was ripping about the ego , said bertie 
i was rather splendid myself , said billy , when i got going 
i gave him a huge ster about memory 
after lunch both retired to their beds and fell into sweet oblivion until seven o clock , when they rose and dined , and after playing a little poker went to bed again pretty early 
me six mornings later , when the professor returned their papers to them , their minds were washed almostas clear of plato and thales as were their bodies of yestrday s dust  the dates and doctrines , hastly memorized to rattle off upon the great occasion , lay only upon the surface of their minds , and after use they quickly evaporated 
to their pleasure and mostgenuine astnishment , the professor paid them high compliments 
bertie s discussion of the double personality had been the mostintelligent which had come in from any of the class 
the illustation of the intoxicated hackdrver who had fallen from his hack and inquired who it was that had fallen , and then had pitied himself , was , said the professor , as original and perfect an illustation of our subjectiveobjectivity as he had met with in all his researches 
billy s suggestons concerning the inherency of time and space in the mind the professor had also found very stiking and independent , particularly his reasoning based upon the wellknown distrtions of time and space which hashish and other drgs produce in us 
this was the sort of thing which the professor had wanted from his stdents  free comment and discussions , the spirit of the course , rather than any stict adherence to the letter 
he had constucted his questons to elicit as much individual discussion as possible and had been somewhat disappointed in his hopes 
yes , bertie and billy were astnished 
their astnishment did not equal that of oscar , who had answered many of the questons in the professor s own language 
oscar received seventyfive per cent for this achievementa good mark 
billy s mark was eightysix and bertie s ninety 
there is some mistke , said oscar to them when they told him  
he hastned to the professor with his tale 
there is no mistke , said the professor 
oscar smiled with increased deference 
he urged , i assure you , sir , those young men knew absolutely nothing 
i was their tutor , and they knew nothing at all 
i taught them all their information myself 
in that case , replied the professor , not pleased with oscar s talebearing , you musthave given them more than you could spare 
good morning 
oscar never understod 
he graduated considerably higher than bertie and billy , who were not able to discover many other courses so favorable to orriginal rresearch as was philosophy 4 
that is twenty years ago , today bertie is treasurer of the new amstrdam trustcompany , in wall steet 
billy is superintendent of passenger traffic of the new york and chicago air line 
oscar is successful too 
he has acquired a lot of information 
his smile is unchanged

209 the bobbsey twins at school chapter i a circus train mamma , how much longer have we got to ride 
asked nan bobbsey , turning  in her seat in the railroad car , to look at her parents , who sat behind  her 
are you getting tired 
asked nan s brother bert 
if you are i will sit  next to the window , and watch the telegraph poles and trees go by 
maybe that s what tires you , nan , he added , and his father smiled , for  he saw that bert had two thoughts for himself , and one for his sistr 
no , i am not tired of the scenery , answered the brownhaired and  browneyed girl , but you may sit next the window , bert , if you like 
thanks 
he exclaimed as he scrambled over to the place his sistr gave  up 
are you tired , dearie 
asked mr 
bobbsey , leaning forward and  smoothing out her daughter s hair with her hand 
if you would like to  sit with me and put your head in my lap , papa can go to another seat and    oh , no , mamma , i am not as tired as that , and nan laughed 
i was just wondering how soon we would be home 
i would rather be back at the seashore , said bert , not turning his gaze  from the window , for the train was passing along some fields justthen ,  and in one a boy was drving home some cows to be milked , as evening was  coming on 
bert was wondering if one of the cows might not chase the  boy 
bert did not really want to see the boy hurt by a cow , of course ,  but he thought that if the cow was going to take after the boy , anyhow ,  he might justas well see it 
the cows were very wellbehaved , and  went along slowly 
yes , the seashore was nice , murmured nan , as she leaned her head back  on the cushioned seat , but i am glad to be going home again 
i want to  see some of the girls , and  yes , and i will be looking for some of the boys , too , put in bert 
school will soon begin , and that s no fun 
mr and mr 
bobbsey smiled at each other , and mr bobbsey , taking out a  timetable , looked to see how much longer they would be on the train 
it s about an hour yet , he said to nan , and she sighed 
really she  was more tired than she cared to let her mother know 
just ead of the two bobbsey childrn were another set of them 
i say  set for the bobbsey childrn came in sets 
there were two pairs of twins , bert and nan , nearly nine years of age ,  and flossie and freddie , almostfive 
whereas the two older  childrn were rather tall and slim , with dark brown hair and eyes , the  littler twins were short and fat , and had light hair and blue eyes 
the  two pairs of twins were quite a contrast and many persons stpped to  look at them as they passed along the steet together 
no , sir , went on bert musingly , school s no fun , and it strts about  a week after we get home 
no chance to have a good time 
we have had fun all summer , replied his sistr 
i rather like school 
mamma , are we going to school this year 
asked flossie , as she looked  back with a quick turning of her head that set her yellow curls to  dancing 
if we are , i am going to sit with flossie  can t i 
asked freddie ,  kneeling in the seat so that he could face back to his father and  mother 
indeed his requestwas not stange , since the two younger twins were  always together even more so than their brother and sistr 
yes , i think you and freddie will strt school regularly this term ,  said mr 
bobbsey , and , if it can be arranged , you may sit together 
we will see about that 
be careful , freddie , do not put your head out of  the window , she cautioned quickly , for the little chap had turned in  his seat again , and was leaning forward to see a horse galloping about a  field , kicking up its heels at the sound of the puffing engine 
it s my turn to sit by the window , anyhow , said flossie 
it is not 
we haven t passed a sttion yet , disputed freddie 
oh , we have so 
cried his little sistr 
freddie bobbsey 
she  pointed her finger at him 
childrn    childrn , said mr 
bobbsey , reprovingly 
are you two taking turns 
asked bert , smiling with an older brother s  superior wisdom 
yes , answered flossie , he was to have the seat next to the window  until we came to a sttion , and then it s to be my turn until we pass  another sttion , and we have passed one , but he won t change over 
well , it was only a little sttion , anyhow , asserted freddie , and it  came awful quick after the lastone 
it isn t fair 
there s a seat up  ead for you , bert , suggestd mr bobbsey , as a  gentleman got up , when the train approached a sttion 
you can sit  there , and let flossie or freddie take your place 
all right , answered bert goodnaturedly , as he got up 
the train rolled on , the two younger twins each having a window now , and  nan occupying the seat with her little brother 
for a time there was  quietness , until mr 
bobbsey said to her husband  hadn t you better get some of the satchels together , richard , and tell  din  what she is to carry 
i think i will , he answered , as he went up the car aisle a little way  to where a very fat colored woman sat 
she was din  , the bobbsey cook ,  and they took her with them always when going away for the summer 
now  they were on their way to their city house , and of course din  came  back , too 
mamma , i am thirst , said flossie , after a bit 
please may i get a  drnk 
i want one , too , said freddie quicky 
come on , flossie , we will both  go down to the end of the car where the water cooler is 
there s no cup , nan said 
i went a little while ago , but a lady let  me take her glass 
if there was a cup , i would rather they did not use it , said mr 
bobbsey 
one never knows who has lasthandled a public cup 
i want a drnk , insistd flossie , a bit fretfully , for she was  tired from the long journey 
i know it , dear , said her mamma gently , and i am getting out the  silver cup for you 
only you mustbe very careful of it , and not drp  it , for it is solid silver and will dent , or mar , easily 
she was  searching in her bag , and presently took out a very valuable drnking  cup , gold lined and with much engraving on it 
the cup had been  presented to flossie and freddie on their firstbirthday , and bore each  of their names 
they were very proud of it 
now be careful , warned mr 
bobbsey , as she held out the cup 
hold  on to the seats as you walk along 
i will carry the cup , said freddie 
i am the biggest you are not 
declared his sistr quickly 
i am justas big 
well , anyhow , i am a boy , went on freddie , and flossie could not deny  this 
boys always carries things , her brother went on 
i will  carry the cup 
very well , but be careful of it , said his mother with a smile , as she  handed it to him 
the two childrn went down the aisle of the car 
they stpped for a moment at the seat where din  was 
is snoop all right 
asked freddie , peering into a box that was made of  slats , with spaces between them for air 
wouldeed an  he am , honey , said din  with a smile , laughing so that she  shook all over her big , fleshy body 
i  specs he is lonesome 
aren t you , snoop 
asked flossie , poking her  finger in one of the cracks , to caress , as well as she could , a fat ,  black cat 
the cat , like din  the cook , went with the bobbseys on all  their summer outings 
well , maybe he am lonesome , admitted din  , with another laugh , but  he is been real good 
he hadn t yowled once    not once 
he will soon be out of his cage 
won t you , snoop 
near it they saw  something else to look at 
this was the sight of a very , very fat lady  who occupied nearly all of one seat in the end of the car 
she was so  large that only a very little baby could have found room beside her 
look  look at her , whispered flossie to freddie , as they paused 
the  fat woman s back was toward them , and she seemed to be much interestd  in looking out of the window 
she is fat , admitted freddie 
did you ever see one so big before 
only in a circus , said flossie 
she would make make two of din  , went on her brother 
she would not , contradicted flossie quickly 
cause din  s black ,  and this lady is white 
that s so , admitted freddie , with smile 
i did not think of that 
a sway of the train nearly made flossic fall , and she caught quickly at  her brother 
look out 
he cried 
you  mos knocked the cup down 
i did not mean to , spoke flossie 
oh , there goes my hat 
get it ,  freddie , before someone stps on it 
her brother managed to get the hat justas it was sliding under the seat  where the fat lady sat 
after some confusion the hat was placed on flossie s head , and once more  she and her brother moved on toward the water cooler 
it was getting  dusk now , and some of the lamps in the car had been lighted 
freddie , carrying the cup , filled it with water at the little faucet ,  and , very politely , offered it to his sistr first  freddie was no  better than mostboys of his age , but he did not forget some of the  little polite ways his mamma was continually teaching him 
one of these  was ladies first though freddie did not always carry it out ,  especially when he was in a hurry 
do you want any more 
he asked , before he would get himself a drnk 
justa little , said flossie 
the silver cup doesn t hold much 
no , i guess it s  cause there s so much silver in it , replied her  brother 
it s worth a lot of money , mamma said 
yes , and it s all ours 
when i grow up i am going to have my half made  into a bracelet 
you are 
if you do there won t be enough left  for me to drnk out of 
well , you can have your share of it made into a watch , and drnk out of  a glass 
that s so , agreed freddie , his face brightening 
he gave his sistr  more water , and then took some himself 
as he drnk his eyes were  constntly looking at the very fat lady who filled so much of her seat 
she turned from the window and looked at the two childrn , smiling  broadly 
freddie was somewhat confused , and looked down quickly 
just then the train gave another lurch and freddie suddenly spilled some of  the water on his coat 
oh , look what you did 
cried flossie 
that s your bestcoat 
i  i couldn t help it , stmmered freddie 
never mind , little boy , said the fat lady 
it s only clean water 
come here and i will wipe it off with my handkerchief 
i would come to you ,  only i am so stut it s hard enough for me to walk anyhow , and when the  train is moving i simply can t do it 
freddie and flossie went to her seat , and with a handkerchief , that  flossie said afterward was almostas big as a table cloth , the fat lady  wiped the water off freddie s coat 
the little boy held the silver cup in his hand , and feeling , somehow ,  that he ought to repay the fat lady s kindness in some way , after  thanking her , he asked  would you like a drnk of water 
i can bring it to you if you would 
thank you , she answered 
what a kind little boy you are 
i saw you  give your sistr a drnk first too 
yes , i would like a drnk 
i have  been wanting one some time , but i did not dare get up to go after it 
i will get it 
cried freddie , eager to show what a little man he was 
he made his way to the cooler without accident , and then , moving slowly ,  taking hold of the seat on the way back , so as not to spill the water ,  he brought the silver cup brimful to the fat lady 
oh , what a beautiful cup , she said , as she took it 
it costa lot of money , too , said flossie 
it s ours  our  birthday cup , and when i grow up i am going to have a bracelet made from  my half 
that will be nice , said the fat lady , as she prepared to drnk 
she never got more than a sip of the water freddie had so kindly  brought her , for , no sooner did her lips touch the cup than there was a  grinding , shrieking sound , a jar to the railway coach , and the train  came to such a sudden stp that many passengers were thrown from their  seats 
flossie and freddie sat down suddenly in the aisle , but they were so fat  that they did not mind it in the least  as surprised as he was , freddie  noticed that the fat lady was so large that she could not be thrown out  of her seat , no matter how suddenly the train stpped 
the little  bobbsey boy saw the water from the cup spill all over the fat lady , and  she held the silver vessel in her big , pudgy hand , looking curiously at  it , as though wondering what had so quickly become of the water 
it s a wreck  the train s off the track 
a man exclaimed 
we have hit something 
cried another 
it s an accident , anyhow , said stll a third , and then every one  seemed to be talking at once 
mr bobbsey came running down the aisle to where flossie and freddie  stll sat , dazed 
are you hurt 
he cried , picking them both up together , which was  rather hard to do 
no  no , said freddie slowly 
oh , papa , what is it 
asked flossie , wondering whether she was going  to cry 
i do not know , my dear 
nothing serious , i guess 
the engineer must have put the brakes on too quickly 
i will look out and see 
knowing that his childrn were safe , mr bobbsey put them down and led  them back to where his wife was anxiously waiting 
they are all right , he called 
no one seems to be hurt 
bert bobbsey looked out of the window 
though darkness had fallen there  seemed to be many lights up  ead of the stpped train 
in the  light bert could see some camels , an elephant or two , a number of  horses , and cages containing lions and tigers stung out along the  track 
why    why , what s this    a circus 
he asked 
look , nan 
see  those monkeys 
why , it is a circus    and the train musthave been wrecked 
exclaimed his sistr 
oh mamma , what can it be 
a brakeman came into the car where the bobbseys were 
there s no danger , he said 
please keep your seats 
a circus train  that was running  ead of us got off the track , and some of the animals  are loose 
our train nearly ran into an elephant , and that s why the  engineer had to stp so suddenly 
we will go on i soon 
a circus , eh 
well , well 
this is an adventure ,  childrn 
we have run into a circus train 
let s watch them catch the  animals 
chapter ii snoop is gone papa , do you think a tiger would come in here 
asked freddie ,  remembering all the stries of wild animals he had heard in his four  years 
or a lion 
asked flossie 
of course not 
exclaimed nan 
can t you see that all the wild  animals are stll in their cages 
maybe some of  em are loose , suggestd freddie , and he almosthoped  so , as long as his father was there to protect him 
i guess the circus men can look after them , said bert 
may i get  off , father , and look around 
i would rather you wouldn t , son 
you can t tell what may happen 
oh , look at that man after the monkey 
cried nan 
yes , and the monkey s gone up on top of the tiger s cage , added bert 
say , this is as good as a circus , anyhow 
me of the big , flaring lights , used in the tents at night , had been  set going so the circus and railroad men could see to work , and this  glare gave the bobbseys and other passengers on the train a chance to  see what was going on 
there s a big elephant 
cried freddie 
see him push the lion s cage  around 
elephants are awful stong 
they couldn t push a railroad train , said flossie 
they could too 
cried her little brother , quickly 
they could not 
could they , papa 
what 
asked mr bobbsey , absentmindedly 
could an elephant push a railroad train 
asked flossie 
i know they could , declared freddie 
couldn t they , papa 
now , childrn , do not argue 
look out of the windows , adivsed their  mother 
while the circus men are trying to catch the escaped animals i will  tell you something more about the bobbseys , and about the other books ,  before this one , relating to their doings 
mr richard bobbsey , and his wife mary , the parents of the bobbsey  twins , lived in an eastrn city called lakeport , on lake metoka 
mr  bobbsey was in the lumber business , and the yard , with its great piles  of logs and boards , was near the lake , on which the twins often went in  boats 
there was also a river running into the lake , not far from the  saw mill 
their house was about a quarter of a mile away from the lumber yard , on  a fashionable steet , and about it was a large lawn , while in the back  sam johnson , the colored man of all work , and the husband of din  , had  a fine garden 
the bobbseys had many vegetables from this garden 
there was also a barn near the house , and in this the childrn had many  good times 
flossie and freddie played there more than did nan and  bert , who were growing too old for games of that sort 
as i have said , bert and nan were rather tall and thin , while flossie  and freddie were short and fat 
mr bobbsey used often to call flossie  his fat fairy , which always made her laugh 
freddie had a pet  name , too 
it was fat fireman , for he often played that he was a  fireman 
putting out makebelieve fires , and pretending he was a fire  engine 
once or twice his father had taken him to see a real one , and  this pleased freddie very much 
in the firstbook of this series , called the bobbsey twins , i told you  something of the fun the four childrn had in their home town 
they had  troubles , too , and danny rugg , one of the few bad boys in lakeport , was  the cause of some 
also about a certain broken window 
what happened  when the twins went coastng , how they had a good time in an ice boat ,  and how they did many other things 
snoop , the fat , black kitten , played a part in the stry also 
the  bobbsey twins were very fond of snoop , and had kept him so many years  that i suppose he ought to be called cat , instad of a kitten , now 
after the firstwinter s fun , told of in the book that began an account  of the doings of the bobbseys , the twins and their parents went to the  home of uncle daniel bobbsey , and his wife , aunt sar  , in meadow brook 
in the book called the bobbsey twins in the country , i wrote down many  of the things that happened during the summer 
if they had fun going off to the country , taking snoop with them , of  course , they had many more good times on arriving at the farm 
there  was a picnic , jolly times in the woods , a fourth of july celebration ,  and though a midnight scare alarmed them for a time , stll they did not  mind that 
though the twins liked the country very much , they soon had a  chance to see something of the ocean , and in the third book of the  series , called the bobbsey twins at the seashore , my readers will find  out what happened there 
there was fun on the sand , and more fun in the water , and once the  little ones got loston an island 
a great strm came up , and a ship  was wrecked , and this gave the twins a chance to see the life savers ,  those brave men who risk their lives to help others 
came closing days at ocean cliff , the home of uncle william and  aunt emily minturn at sunset beach 
school was soon to open , and mr  and mr 
bobbsey were anxious to get back to their town home , for  flossie and freddie were to strt regular lessons now , even though it  was but in the kindergarten class 
goodbyes were said to the ocean , and though dorothy minturn cried a  little when her cousins nan and flossie , and bert and freddie , had to  leave , stll she said she hoped they would come again 
so the  bobbseys were on their way home in the train when the circus accident  happened that brought them to a stp 
so we nearly ran into an elephant , eh 
yes , sir 
our engineer stpped justin time 
if we had hit him we would gone off the track , said freddy 
no , we wouldn t , declared flossie , who seemed bound to strt a  dispute 
perhaps she was so tired that she was fretful 
say , can t you two stp disputing all the while 
asked bert , in a low  voice 
you make papa and mamma nervous 
well , an elephant is big , anyhow , said freddie 
he is , little fat fireman , said nan , come and sit with me , and we  can see the men catch the monkeys 
the work of getting the escaped animals back into their cages was going  on rapidly 
me of the passengers went out to watch , but the bobbseys  styed in their seats , mr bobbsey thinking this best  the catching of  the monkeys was the hardestwork , but soon even this was accomplished 
the wait seemed very tiresome when there was nothing more to watch , and  mr bobbsey looked about for some railroad man of whom he could inquire  how much longer delay there would be 
the conductor came through the  car 
when will we strt 
asked mr bobbsey 
not for some time , i am afraid , spoke the tickettaker 
the wreck is a  worse one than i thought at first and some of the cars of the circus  train are across the track so we can t get by 
we may be here two hours  yet 
that s too bad 
where are we 
justoutside of whitewood 
oh , that s near home 
exclaimed mr 
bobbsey 
why can t we get out ,  richard , walk across the fields to the trolley line , and take that home 
it won t be far , and we will be there ever so much quicker 
well , we could do that , i suppose , said her husband , slowly 
that s what a number of passengers did , said the conductor 
there s  no danger in going out now    all the animals are back in their cages 
that s what we will do , childrn , said their father 
gather up  your things , and we will take the trolley home 
the moon is coming up ,  and it will soon be light 
i am hungry , said freddie , fretfully 
am i , added his twin sistr 
well , i have some crackers and cookies in my bag , replied mr 
bobbsey 
you can eat those on the way 
nan , go tell din  that we are  going to take a trolley 
we can each carry something 
i will carry snoop , exclaimed freddie 
he hurried down the aisle to  where the cook was now stnding , intending to get the box containing his  pet cat 
where s snoop , din  
he asked 
he  he am 
she said , lifting up the slatbox 
he ain t made a sound  in all dis confusion , nuther 
the next moment freddie gave a cry of dismay  snoop s gone 
he wailed 
he broke open the box and he is gone 
oh ,  where is snoop 
ma sakes alive 
cried din  
the box was empty 
a hurried search of the car did not bring forth the black pet 
mr and  mr 
bobbsey , and some of the passengers , joined in the hunt 
there  was no snoop , and a slat that had pulled loose from one side of the box  showed how he had gotten out 
mostlikely snoop got frightened when the train stpped so suddenly ,  and broke loose , said mr bobbsey 
we may find him outside 
i    i hope an elephant did not stp on him said flossie , with a catch  in her breath 
ohooo 
maybe a tiger or a lion has him 
wailed freddie 
oh , snoop 
be quiet , dear , we will find him for you , said mr 
bobbsey , as she  opened her satchel to get out some cookies 
she remembered  something 
freddie , where is that silver cup 
she asked 
you had it to get a  drnk 
did you give it back to me 
no , mamma , i    i he gave the fat lady a drnk from it , spoke flossie , and she did not  give it back 
the train stpped justas she was drnking , went on freddie 
i sat  down on the floor    hard , and i saw the water spill on her 
the fat  lady has our silver cup 
oh , dear 
she is gone    and snoop is gone 
cried flossie 
oh 
oh 
is that so  did you let her take your cup , freddie 
asked his papa 
freddie only nodded 
he could not speak 
that fat lady was with the circus , said one of the men passengers 
maybe you can see her outside 
i will look , said mr bobbsey , quickly 
that cup is too valuable to  lose 
come , childrn , we will see if we can t find snoop also , and then  we will take a trolley car for home 
chapter iii a queer dog papa bobbsey firstlooked for some of the circus men of whom he might  inquire about the fat lady 
there was much confusion , for a circus  wreck is about as bad a kind as can happen , and for some time mr  bobbsey could find no one who could tell him what he wanted to know 
meanwhile mr 
bobbsey kept the four childrn and din  with her ,  surrounding their little pile of baggage off to one side of the tracks 
me of the big torches were stll burning , and the full moon was coming  up , so that there was plenty of light , even if it was night 
oh , but if we could only find snoop 
cried freddie 
here , snoop 
snoop 
he called 
i had much rather find the fat lady , and get back your lovely silver  cup , said mr 
bobbsey 
i hope she hasn t taken it away with her 
she had it in her hand when the train , stpped with such a jerk ,  explained flossie 
oh , but mamma , do not you want us to find snoop     dear snoop 
of course i do 
i want that silver cup very much , too 
i hope  your father finds it 
there never could be another snoop , cried flossie 
could there ,  freddie 
we could get another silver cup 
do not be silly , advised bert , rather shortly 
oh , do not talk that way to them , said nan 
they do love that cat so 
never mind , flossie and freddie 
i am sure we will find him soon 
here  comes papa 
mr bobbsey came back , looking somewhat worried 
did you find her 
asked mr 
bobbsey anxiously 
no , he replied , with a shake of his head 
she was the circus fat  lady all right 
it seems she missed the showtrain , and came on in ours 
when we stpped she got out , and went up  ead 
part of the circus  train , carrying the performers , was not damaged and that has gone on 
the fat lady is with that , so one of the men said 
very likely , she has carried off our silver cup , exclaimed mr 
bobbsey 
oh dear 
can you find her later , richard 
i think so 
it will take some time 
the circus is going to  danville    that s a hundrd miles from here 
i will write to the  managers there , and ask them to get our cup from the fat lady 
where is snoop 
asked freddie , with much anxiety 
i do not know , my dear , answered mr bobbsey 
i asked the circus men  if they had seen him , but they were too busy to remember 
he may be  running around some where 
we can t wait any longer 
we mustget  home 
i will speak to one of the switchmen , who sty around here , and if  they see snoop i will have them keep him for us 
we will come back tomorrow  and inquire 
we want snoop now 
exclaimed freddie , fretfully 
i am afraid we can t get him , said mr 
bobbsey , gently 
come ,  childrn , let s go home now , and leave it to papa 
oh , to think of your  lovely silver cup being gone 
snoop is worse , said flossie , almostcrying 
i    i am sorry i let the fat lady take the cup , spoke freddie 
oh , you meant all right , my dear , said his mamma , and it was very  kind of you 
we really ought to strt 
we may miss a trolley 
come , din  , can you carry all you have 
wouldeed an  i can , mr 
bobbsey 
i su  am sorry  bout dat ar   snoop 
oh , it wasn t your fault , din  , said nan quickly 
he is getting to  be such a big cat that he can easily push the slats off his box , now 
we mustmake it stonger next time 
flossie and freddie wondered if there would be a next time , for they  feared snoop was gone forever 
they did not worry so much about the  silver cup , valuable as it was 
with everyone in the little party carrying something , the bobbsey family  set off across , the fields toward the distnt trolley line that would  take them nearly home 
the moon was well up now , and there was a good  path across the fields 
nan and bert were talking about the wreck , and  recalling some of the funny incidents of catching the circus animals 
flossie and freddie were wondering whether they would ever see their pet  cat again 
they had had him so long that he seemed like one of the  family 
maybe he ran off and joined the circus , said flossle 
maybe , spoke her brother 
he can t do any tricks , so they won t  want him in a show 
he can so do tricks 
he can chase his tail and almostgrab it 
that isn t a trick 
it is so  as much as stnding on your head 
childrn    childrn    i do not know what i will do with you if you  do not stp that constnt bickering , said mr 
bobbsey 
you mustnot  dispute so 
well , mamma , but isn t chasing your tail a trick 
asked flossie 
freddie says it isn t 
well , it isn t a circus trick , anyhow , declared her brother 
i meant  a circus trick 
well , snoop is a good cat , anyhow , went on flossie , and i wish we had  him back 
oh , so do i 
exclaimed freddie , and thus that little dispute ended 
they were walking along through a little patch of woods now , when bert ,  who was the lastone in line , suddenly called out  something is coming after us 
coming after us 
what do you mean 
asked nan quickly , as she hurried  to her father s side 
i mean i have been listning for two or three minutes now , to some animal  following after us along the path 
me big animal , too 
flossie and freddie both ran back and took hold of their mother s hands 
do not scare the childrn , bert , said mr bobbsey , a bit strnly 
did  you really hear something 
yes , father 
it s some animal walking behind us 
listn and you can  hear it your self 
they all listned 
it was very quiet 
from down the hard dirt  path they all heard the pitpat , pitpat of the footstps of some  animal 
it was coming on slowly 
for a moment mr bobbsey thought of the wild animals of the circus 
in  spite of what the men had said perhaps one of the beast might have  escaped from its cage 
the others in the little party evidently thought  the same thing 
mr 
bobbsey drw her childrn more closely about her 
wouldeed an  if it s one ob dem elephants , said din  , an  if he comes  fo  me i will jab m  hat pin in his long nose    dat s what i will 
it can t be an elephant , said mr bobbsey 
one of the big beast  would make more noise than that 
it may be one of the monkeys    i  do not see how they could catch them all    they were so lively and full  of mischief 
oh , if it s a monkey , may we keep it 
begged flossie 
i justlove a  monkey 
mercy , child 
what would we do with it around the house 
cried mr 
bobbsey 
richard , can you see what it is 
mr bobbsey peered down the road 
i can see something , he said 
it s coming nearer 
oh dear 
cried nan , trembling with fear 
justthen a bark sounded    a friendly bark 
it s a dog 
bobbsey 
oh , i am so glad it wasn t an  elephant , and she hugged freddie and flossie 
pooh 
i wasn t afraid 
cried freddie 
if it had been an elephant i    i would give him a cookie , and maybe he would let me ride home on his back 
the animal barked louder now , and a moment later he came into sight on a  moonlit part of the path 
the childrn could see that it was a big ,  shaggy white dog , who wagged his tail in greeting as he walked up to  them 
oh , what a lovely dog 
cried nan 
i wonder where he belongs 
the fine animal came on 
bert snapped his fingers , boyfashion 
instntly the dog stod up on his hind legs and began marching about in  a circle on the path 
oh , what a queer dog 
cried flossie 
oh i wish he was ours 
chapter iv home in an auto down on his four legs drpped the big white dog , and with another wag of  his fluffy tail he came staight for flossie 
be careful 
warned mamma bobbsey 
he won t hurt her 
declared bert 
that s a good dog , anyone can tell  that 
here , doggie 
come here 
he called 
the dog stll advanced toward flossie , who shrank back a bit  timidly 
you never can tell what dogs will do , said mr 
bobbsey 
it is best to be careful 
i guess he knew what flossie said to him , spoke up freddie 
he knows  we like dogs 
the dog barked a little , and , coming up to where flossie was , again  stod on his hind legs 
that s a queer trick , said mr bobbsey 
i guess this dog has been  trained 
he probably belongs around here 
i wish he belonged to us , sighed nan 
like flossie and freddie she ,  too , loved animals 
maybe we can keep him if we do not find snoop 
suggestd freddie 
oh ,  papa , will you get snoop back 
freddie s voice sounded as though he  was going to cry 
yes , yes , of course i will , said mr bobbsey quickly 
he did not want  the childrn to fret now , with stll quite a distnce yet to go home ,  and that in a trolley car 
there were bundles to carry , weary childrn  to look after , and mr 
bobbsey was rather tired also 
no wonder papa  bobbsey thought he had many things to do that night 
come along , childrn , called mr 
bobbsey , it is getting late , and we  are only about half way to the trolley 
oh dear 
if that circus had to  be wrecked i wish it could have waited until our train passed 
are you very tired 
asked her husband 
i can take that valise 
indeed you will not 
you have enough 
lemme have it , massa bobbsey , pleaded din  
i ain t carryin  half  enough 
i s pow ful stong , i is 
nonsense , din  
i can manage , and your arms are  full 
i  i wish she had snoop , said freddie , but he was so interestd in  watching the queer dog that he half forgot his sorrow over the lostcat 
the dog seemed to have made great friends with flossie 
she was patting  him on the head now , for the animal , after marching about on his hind  legs , was down on all fours again 
oh , mamma , he is awful nice 
exclaimed flossie 
he is justas gentle ,  and he is soft , like the little toy lamb i used to have 
indeed he does seem to be a gentle dog , said mr 
bobbsey 
come  along now 
do not pet him any more , or he may follow us 
flossie , and  whoever owns him would not like it 
come on 
forward    march 
called freddie , stutting along the moonlit path as  much like a soldier as he could imitate , tired as he was 
the bobbseys and their faithful din  strted off again toward the  distnt trolley that would take them to their home 
the dog sat down  and looked after them 
i  i wish he was ours , said flossie wistully , waving her hand to the  dog 
the bobbseys had not gone on very far before nan , looking back , called  out  oh , papa , that dog is following us 
he is 
exclaimed mr bobbsey 
that s queer 
he musthave taken a  sudden liking to us 
i guess he will go back where he belongs pretty  soon 
are you getting tired , little fat fireman 
you , my fat  fairy 
oh , no , papa , laughed flossie 
i sat down so much in the train that  i am glad to stnd up now 
am i , said freddie , who made up his mind that he would not say he  was tired if his little sistr did not 
yet , truth to tell , the  little fat fireman was very weary 
on and on went the bobbsey family , and soon bert happened to look back ,  and gave a whiste of surprise 
that dog isn t going home , papa , he said 
he is stll after us , and  look 
now he is running 
they all glanced back on hearing this 
surely enough the big white dog  was running after them , wagging his tail joyfully , and barking from time  to time 
this will never do 
exclaimed mr bobbsey 
whoever owns him may  think we are trying to take him away 
i will drve him back 
go home 
go back , sir 
exclaimed papa bobbsey in strn tones 
the dog stpped wagging his tail 
he sat down on the path , and  calmly waited 
mr bobbsey walked toward him 
oh , do not    do not whip him , papa 
exclaimed flossie 
i do not intend to , said mr bobbsey 
i mustbe strn with him or  he will think i am only playing 
go back 
he cried 
the dog stetched out on the path , his head down between his fore paws 
he    he looks  sad , said freddie 
maybe he hasn t any home ,  papa 
oh , of course a valuable dog like that has a home , declared bert 
maybe they did not treat him kindly , and he is looking for a new  one , suggestd nan , hopefully 
he doesn t seem illtreated , spoke mr 
bobbsey 
oh , i do wish he would  go back , so we could go on 
mr bobbsey pretended to pick up a stne and throw it at the dog , as  mastrs sometimes do when they do not want their dogs to follow them 
this dog only wagged his tail , as though he thought it the bestjoke he  had ever known 
go back 
go back , i say 
cried papa bobbsey in a loud voice 
the dog  did not move 
i guess he won t follow us any more , went on mr bobbsey 
hurry  along now , childrn 
we are almostat the trolley 
he turned away  from the dog , who seemed to be asleep now , and the family went on 
for  a minute or two , as nan could tell by looking back , the dog did not  follow , but justas the bobbseys were about to make a turn in the path ,  up jumped the animal and came trotting on after the childrn and their  parents , wagging his tail so fastthat it seemed as if it would come  loose 
is he coming 
asked flossie 
he certainly is , answered bert , who was in the rear 
i guess he  wants us to take him home with us 
oh , let s do it 
begged flossie 
please , papa , pleaded freddie 
we haven t got snoop now , so let us  have a dog 
i am sure we could teach him to do tricks    he is so  smart 
so he is coming after us stll 
exclaimed mr bobbsey 
well ,  well , i do not know what to do , and he came to a stp on the path 
couldn t we take him home justfor tonight 
asked nan , and then in  the morning we could find out who owns him and return him 
oh , please do , begged freddie and flossie , impulsively 
how can we take him on a trolley car 
asked mr bobbsey 
the  conductor would not let us 
maybe he would    if he was a kind man , suggestd freddie 
we could  tell him how it was , and how we lostour cat 
our silver cup , added flossie 
well , certainly the dog doesn t seem to want to go home , said mr  bobbsey , after he had tried two or three times more to drve the animal  back 
it would not go 
go on a little farther , suggestd mr 
bobbsey 
by the time we get  to the trolley he may get tired , and go back 
if we want to lose  him i think we can , by getting on the car quickly 
we do not want to lose him 
cried freddie 
no , no 
we want to keep him 
he can run along behind  the trolley car 
i will ask the motorman to go slow , papa 
my 
this has been a mixedup day 
sighed mr bobbsey 
i really do not  know what to do 
the dog seemed to think that he was one of the family , now 
he came up  to flossie and freddie and let them pat him 
his tail kept wagging all  the while 
well , we will see what happens where we get to the trolley , decided mr  bobbsey , thinking that there would be the bestand only place to get rid  of the dog 
come along , childrn 
freddie and flossie came on , the dog between them , and this seemed to  suit the fine animal 
he had found friends , now , he evidently thought 
mr bobbsey wondered why so valuable a dog would leave its home 
he  was very much puzzled as to what he should do if the childrn insistd  on keeping the animal , and if it came aboard the trolley car 
there s the car 
exclaimed bert , as they went around another turn in  the path and came to a road 
down it could be seen the headlight of an  approaching trolley , and also the twin lamps of an oncoming automobile 
look out for the auto , childrn 
cried mr 
bobbsey 
they stod at the side of the road , and as the auto came up the man in  it slowed down his machine 
it was a big car and he was alone in it 
well , i declare 
exclaimed the autoist as his engine stpped 
if it  isn t the bobbsey family  twins and all 
what are you doing here , mr  bobbsey 
why , it s mr blake 
exclaimed mr bobbsey , seeing that the autoist was a neighbor , and a business friend of his 
oh , our train was held  back by a circus wreck , so we walked across the lots to the car 
we are  homeward bound from the seashore 
well , well 
a circus wreck , eh 
where did you get the dog 
oh , he followed us , said mr 
bobbsey 
we are going to keep him , too 
exclaimed flossie 
take him in the trolley with us , added her little brother 
well , well 
exclaimed mr blake 
say , now , i have a better plan than  that , he went on 
why should you folks go home in a trolley , when i  have this big empty auto here 
pile in , all of you , and i will get you  there in a jiffy 
come , din  , i see you , too 
yes , s  , massa blake , i se he  
can t lose ole din  
we lostour cat , snoop 
we nearly ran over an elephant , added freddie , bound that his  sistr should not tell all the news 
well , get in the auto , invited mr blake 
do you really mean it 
asked mr bobbsey 
perhaps we are keeping you  from going somewhere 
indeed not 
pile in , and you will soon be home 
can we bring the dog , too 
asked flossie 
yes , there s plenty of room for the dog , laughed mr blake 
lift him  in 
the stange dog did not need lifting 
he sprang into the tonneau of  the auto as soon as the door was opened 
mr and mr 
bobbsey lifted in  flossie and freddie , and nan and bert followed 
in got papa and  mamma bobbsey and mr blake strted off 
this is lovely , said mr 
bobbsey with a sigh of relief 
she was more  tired than she had thought 
it certainly is kind of you , mr blake , said papa bobbsey 
i am only too glad i happened to meet you 
are you childrn  comfortable 
yep 
chorused freddie and flossie 
the dog 
we are holding him so he won t fall out , explained flossie 
she and  her little brother had the dog between them 
on went the auto , and with the telling of the adventures of the day the  journey seemed very short 
on the bobbsey home was reached 
there  were lights in it , for sam , the colored man , had been telephoned to , to  have the place opened for the family 
sam came out on the stop to  greet them and his wife din  
here we are 
cried papa bobbsey 
come , flossie freddie we are home 
flossie and freddie did not answer 
they were fastasleep , their heads  on the shaggy back of the big dog 
chapter v snap does tricks we will have to carry them in , said mr bobbsey , as he looked in the  rear of the auto , and saw his two little twins fastasleep on the dog s  back 
i will take  em , said sam kindly 
many a time i se carried  em in  offen de porch when dey falled asleep 
i will carry  em in 
he did , firsttaking flossie , and then freddie 
he and din   brought in the bundles and valises , while nan and bert and mr and mr 
bobbsey followed , having bidden goodnight to mr blake , and thanking him  for the ride 
where  where are we 
asked flossie , rubbing her eyes and looking  around the room which she had not seen in some months 
an   an  where s our dog 
demanded freddie 
oh , bless your hearts  that dog 
cried mamma bobbsey 
sam took him  out in the barn 
you may see him in the morning , if he doesn t run away  in the night 
the twins looked worried over this suggeston , until sam said  oh , i locked him up good an  proper in a box stll 
wouldeed an  i did ,  mr 
bobbsey 
he won t get away tonight 
that s  good , murmured freddie , and then he fell asleep again 
on the little twins were undrssed and put to bed 
nan and bert soon  followed , but mr and mr 
bobbsey styed up a little later to talk over  certain matters 
it s good to be home again , said mr bobbsey , as he looked about the  rooms of the town house 
yes , but we had a delightful summer , spoke his wife , and the childrn  are so well 
the country was delightful , and so was the seashore 
i think i , too , am glad to be back 
it will be quite a task , though , to  get the childrn ready for school 
flossie and freddie will go  regularly now , i suppose , and with nan and bert in a higher class , it  means plenty of work 
i suppose so , said her husband 
din  is a great help , went on mr 
bobbsey , for she did not mean  to complain 
flossie and freddie had tried a few days in the  kindergarten class at school , but flossie said she did not like it , and ,  as freddie would not go without her , their parents had taken them both  out in the spring 
there will be plenty of time to strt them in the fall , said mr 
bobbsey , and so it had been arranged 
now the four twins were all  to attend the same school , which would open in about a week 
flossie and freddie were both up early the next morning , and , scarcely  halfdrssed , they hurried out to the barn 
whar yo  chillers gwine 
demanded din  , as she prepared to get  breakfast out to see our dog , answered freddie 
is sam around 
yes , he is out dere somewheres , washin  de carriage 
do not yo  let  dat dog bite yo  
we won t , said freddie 
he wouldn t bite anyhow , declared flossie 
sam opened the box stll for them , and out bounced the big white dog ,  barking in delight , and almostknocking down the twins , so glad was he  to see them 
what shall we call him 
asked freddie 
maybe we would better name him  snoop , like our cat 
i guess snoop is gone forever 
no , we must t call him snoop , said flossie , for some day our cat  might come back , and he would want his own name again 
we will call our dog  snap ,  cause see how bright his eyes snap 
if our cat comes back  we will have snoop and snap 
that s a good name , decided freddie , after thinking it over 
snoop  and snap 
i wonder how we can make this dog stnd on his hind legs like  he did before 
bert snapped his fingers and he did it , suggestd flossie 
maybe  he will do it now if you justask him to 
freddie tried to snap his fingers , but they were too short and fat 
he patted the dog an the head and said  stnd up 
at once the dog , with a bark , did so 
he sat up on his hind legs and  then walked around 
both the childrn laughed 
i wonder if he can do any other tricks 
asked flossie 
i am going to try , said her brother 
what trick do you want him to  do 
make him lie down and roll over 
all right , spoke freddie 
now , snap , lie down and roll over 
he  called 
at once the fine animal did so , and then sprang up with a bark ,  and a wag of his tail , as much as to ask  what shall i do next 
oh , isn t he a fine dog 
cried flossie 
i wonder who taught him  those tricks 
let s see if he can do any more , said freddie 
there s a barrel hoop  over there 
maybe he will jump through it if we hold it up oh , let s do it 
cried flossie , as she ran to get the hoop 
snap  barked at the sight of it , and capered about as though he knew justwhat  it was for , and was pleased at the chance to do more of his tricks 
the  hoop was a large one , and freddie alone could not hold it very stady 
flossie took hold of one side 
as soon as they were in position ,  freddie called  come on now , snap 
jump 
snap barked , ran back a little way , turned around and came racing  staight for the twins 
at that moment sam johnson came up running , a  stck in his hand 
he  
he  
shouted the colored man , you let dem chillers alone , dog 
go  way , i tells yo  
that s all right , sam , said freddie 
do not scare him 
he is our new  dog snap , and he is going to do a trick , for the colored gardener had  supposed the dog was running at flossie and freddie to bite them 
snap paid no attention to sam , but raced on 
when a short distnce from  where flosxie and freddie held the hoop , snap jumped up into the air ,  and shot staight through the wooden circle , landing quite a way off 
m  gracious sakes alive 
gasped sam 
dat s a reg lar circus trick`  at s what it am 
he scratched his head in surprise , and the stck he had picked up ,  intending to drve away the dog with , stck staight out 
in a moment  snap raced up , and jumped over the stck 
oh , look 
cried flossie 
another trick 
exclaimed freddie 
m  gracious goodness 
cried sam 
dat su  am wonderful 
snap ran about barking in delight 
he seemed happy to be doing tricks 
let s go tell papa , said freddie 
he will want to know about this 
oh , i do hope he lets us keep him , said flossie 
mr bobbsey had not yet gone to his lumber office 
he listned to what  the little twins had to tell them about snap , who lay on the lawn ,  seeming to listn to his own praises 
a trick dog 
eh 
exclaimed mr bobbsey 
i wonder who owns him 
maybe he escaped from the circus , suggestd bert , who came out just then to see how his pigeons were getting along 
that s it 
cried mr bobbsey 
i wonder i did not think of it before 
the dog musthave escaped from the wrecked circus train , and he followed  us , not knowing what else to do 
that accounts for his tricks 
we can keep him 
can t we 
begged flossie 
hum 
i will have to see about that , said mr bobbsey slowly 
i  suppose the circus people will want him back , for he mustbe valuable 
perhaps some clown trained him 
if we can t have snoop , our cat , we ought to have a dog , asserted  freddie 
i will try to get snoop back , said mr bobbsey 
i will have one of my  men go down to the place where the wreck was , today , and inquire of the  railroad men 
he may be wandering about there 
poor snoop 
while you are about it , suggestd mr 
bobbsey , who was on the  front porch , i wish , richard , that you would see if you can locate that  fat lady , and get back the childrn s silver cup 
i will , replied mr bobbsey 
i will have to write to them anyhow ,  about the dog , and at the same time i will ask about the cup 
though i  do not believe the fat lady meant to keep it 
oh , no , said mr 
bobbsey 
probably she justheld it , in the  excitement over the wreck , and she may have left it in the car 
please write about it 
i will , promised mr bobbsey , as he strted for the office , while the  twins gathered about the new dog , who seemed ready to do more tricks 
chapter vl danny rugg is mean that afternoon a small fire broke out in mr bobbsey s lumber yard 
the  alarm bell rang , and mr 
bobbsey , hearing it , and knowing by the number  that the blaze mustbe near her husband s place of business , came  hurrying down stirs 
oh , i mustgo and see how dangerous it is , she said to din  
it is  too bad to have it happen justafter mr bobbsey comes back from his  summer vacation 
wouldeed it am 
cried the fat , colored cook 
maybe it am only a  little fire , mr 
bobbsey 
i am sure i hope so , was the answer 
as mr 
bobbsey was hurrying down the front walk flossie and freddie saw  her 
where are you going , mamma 
they called 
down to papa s office , she answered 
there s a fire near his place ,  and   oh , a fire 
i am going 
cried freddie 
fire 
fire 
ding , dong 
turn on the water 
he raced about quite excitedly 
oh , i do not know , said mr 
bobbsey , in doubt 
where are nan and  bert 
she asked 
they went down to the lake , said flossie 
oh , mamma , do take us to  the fire with you 
we will bring snap along 
sure , said freddie 
hi , snap 
he called 
the trick dog came rushing from the stble , barking and wagging his  tail 
well , i suppose i might as well take you , said mr 
bobbsey 
you  muststy near me 
we will leave snap home , though 
oh , no 
cried freddie 
he might get lost said mr 
bobbsey 
that was enough for freddie 
he did not want the new pet to get lost  so he did not make a fuss when sam came hurrying up to lock snap in the  stble 
poor snap howled , for he wanted very much to go with the  childrn 
the fire was , as i have said , a small one , in part of the planing mill 
the engines puffed away , and spurted water , and this pleased  freddie 
flossie styed close to her mother , and mr 
bobbsey , once she  found out that the main lumber yard was not in danger , was ready to come  back home 
freddie wanted to sty until the fire was wholly out 
mr bobbsey came from his office to give some directions to the firemen ,  and saw his wife and the two twins 
he took charge of them , and  led them as close to the blaze as was safe 
it will soon be out , he said 
it was only some sawdustthat got on  fire 
i wish i could squirt some water 
sighed freddie 
what s that 
do you want to be a fireman 
asked one of the men in a  rubber coat and a big helmet 
he smiled at mr bobbsey , whom he knew  quite well 
yes , i do , said freddie 
come with me , and i will let you help hold the hose , said the  fireman 
i will look after him , he went on , to mr 
bobbsey , and she  nodded to show that freddie could go 
what a good time the little fellow had , stnding beside a real fireman ,  and helping throw real water on a real fire 
freddie never forgot that 
of course the fire was almostout , and it was only one of the small hose  lines that the fireman let the little fellow help hold , but , for all  that , freddie was very happy 
did you write to the circus people today about our silver cup , and that  trick dog 
asked mr 
bobbsey of her husband , that night 
i declare , i did not 
he exclaimed 
the fire upset me so that it  slipped my mind 
i will do it the firstthing tomorrow 
there is no  special hurry 
how is the dog , by the way 
oh , he is justlovely 
cried flossie 
i do hope we can keep him forever 
exclaimed freddie 
specially  since snoop is gone 
did you hear anything about our cat 
asked nan , of her father 
no 
i sent a man to the railroad company , but no stay cat had been  found 
i am afraid snoop is lost childrn 
oh dear 
cried flossie 
the next day , having learned from the railroad company where the circus  had gone after the wreck , mr bobbsey sent a letter to the manager ,  explaining about the lostsilver cup , and the found circus dog 
he  asked that the fat lady be requestd to write to him , to let him know if  she had taken the cup by accident , and mr bobbsey also wanted to know  if the circus had losta trick dog 
there 
he exclaimed as he sent the letter to be mailed , now we will  justhave to wait for an answer 
nan and bert , and flossie and freddie were soon having almostas much  fun as they had had at the seashore and in the country 
their town  playmates , who had come back from their vacations , called at the bobbsey  home , and made up games and all sorts of sports 
for , said grace lavine , with whom nan sometimes played , school will  soon begin , and we want to have all the fun we can until then 
let s jump rope , proposed nan 
all right , agreed grace 
here comes nellie parks , and we will see who  can jump the most no , you must t do that , said nan 
do not you remember how you once  tried to jump a hundrd , and you fainted 
indeed i do , said grace 
i am not going to be so silly as to try that  again 
we will only jump a little 
on nan and her chums were having good time in the yard 
charley mason , with whom bert sometimes played , came over , and the two  boys went for a row on the lake , in bert s boat 
me little friends of  flossie and freddie came over , and they had fun watching snap do tricks 
for the circus dog , as he had come to be called , seemed to be able to do  some new trick each day 
he could play dead , and say his prayers ,  besides turning a back somersault 
the little twins , who seemed to  claim more share in snap than did nan and bert , did not really know how  many tricks their pet could do 
maybe you will have to give him back to the circus , said willie flood ,  one of freddie s chums 
well , if we do , papa may buy him , or get another dog like him , spoke  flossie 
a few days after this , when bert was out in the front yard , watering the  grass with a hose , along came danny rugg 
now danny went to the same  school that bert did , but few of the boys and none of the girls , liked  danny , because he was often rough , and would hit them or want to fight ,  or would play mean tricks on them 
stll , sometimes danny behaved  himself , and then the boys were glad to have him on their baseball nine  as he was a good hitter and thrower , and he could run fast hello , bert 
exclaimed danny , leaning on the fence 
i hear you have a  trick circus dog here 
who told you 
asked bert , wondering what danny would say next 
oh , jack parker 
he says you found him 
i did not , spoke bert , spraying a bed of geranium flowers 
he  followed us the night of the circus wreck 
well , you took him all the same 
i know who owns him , too 
i am  going to tell that you have got him 
oh , are you 
asked bert 
well , we think he belongs to the circus ,  and my father has written about it , so you needn t trouble yourself 
he doesn t belong to any circus , went on danny 
that dog belongs to  mr peterson , who lives over in millville 
he losta trick dog , and he  adverstsed for it 
he is going to give a reward 
i am going to tell  him , and get the money 
you can t take our dog away 
cried freddie , coming up justthen 
do not you dare do it , danny rugg 
yes , i will 
exclaimed the mean boy , who often teased the smaller  bobbsey twins 
you won t have that dog after today 
do not mind him , freddie , said bert in a low voice 
he is trying to  scare you 
oh , i am eh 
cried danny 
i will show you what i am trying to do 
i will  tell on you for keeping a dog that do not belong to you , and you will be  arrestd  all of you 
freddie looked worried , and tears came into his eyes 
bert saw this ,  and was angry at danny for being so mean 
do not be afraid , freddie , said bert , look , i will let you squirt the  hose , and you can pretend to be a fireman 
oh , fine 
cried freddie , in delight , as he took the nozzle from his  older brother 
justhow it happened neither of them could tell , but the steam of water  shot right at danny rugg , and wet him all over in a second 
hi there 
he cried 
stp that 
i will pay you back for that , fred  bobbsey , and he jumped over the fence and ran toward the little fellow 
chapter vii at school freddie saw danny coming , and did the mostnatural thing in the world 
he drpped the hose and ran 
you know what a hose , with water  burstng from the nozzle will sometimes do if you do not hold it just right 
well , this hose did that 
it seemed to aim itself staight at  danny , and again the rough boy received a charge of water full in the  face 
ha—ha—here 
you quit that 
he gasped 
i will fix you for that 
the water got in his eyes and mouth , and for a moment he could not see 
with his handkerchief he soon had his eyes cleared , and then he came  running toward bert 
danny rugg was larger than bert , and stonger , and , in addition , was a  bullying sort of chap , almostalways ready to fight some one smaller  than himself 
what bert lacked in size and stength he made up in a bold spirit 
he was not at all afraid of danny , even when the bully came rushing at  him 
bert stod his ground manfully 
he had taken up the hose where  freddie had drpped it , and the water was spurting out in a solid  steam 
freddie , having gotten a safe distnce away , now turned and  stod looking at danny 
danny , too , had halted and was fairly glaring at bert , who looked at him  a bit anxiously 
more than once he and the bully had come to blows , and  sometimes bert had gotten the bestof it 
stll he did not like a  fight 
i will get you yet , freddie bobbsey 
cried danny , shaking his fistat  the little fellow 
whereupon freddie turned and ran toward the house 
danny saw that he could not catch him in time , and so he turned to bert 
you put him up to do that  to douse me with water 
cried danny  angrily 
i did not , said bert quietly 
it was justan accident 
i am sorry 
you are not 
i say you did that on purpose or you told freddie to , and  i am going to pay you back 
i tell you it was an accident , insistd bert 
if you want to  think freddie did it on purpose i can t stp you 
well , i am going to hit you justthe same , growled danny , and he  stpped toward bert 
you would better look out , said bert , with justa little smile 
there s  stll a lot of water in this hose , and he brought the nozzle around in  front , ready to squirt on danny if the bad boy should come too near 
danny came to a stp 
do not you dare put any more water on me 
cried the bully 
if you do ,  i will   he doubled up his fist and glared at bert 
do not you come any nearer if you do not want to get wet , said  bert 
this hose might sprinkle you by accident , the same as it did  when freddie had it , he added 
huh 
i know what kind of an accident that was 
spoke danny , with a  sneer 
you would better get out of the way , went on bert quietly 
i want to  sprinkle that flower bed near where you are , and if you are there you  might get wet , and it wouldn t my fault 
i will fix you 
growled danny , springing forward 
bert got ready with  the hose , and there might have been more trouble , except that sam , the  colored man , came out on the lawn 
he saw that something out of the  ordinary was going on , and breaking into a run he called out  am anything de matt  , massa bert 
am yo  habin  trouble wif anybody 
well , i guess it s all over now , said bert , as he saw danny turn and  walk toward the gate 
if yo  need any help , jestrememb  dat i am around , spoke sam , with a  wide grin that showed his white teeth in his black , but kindly face 
i l1 be right handy by , massa bert , yes , i will 
all right , said bert , as he went on watering the flowers 
huh 
you needn t think i am afraid of you 
boastd danny , but he kept  on out of the gate justthe same 
sam went back to his work , of weeding  the vegetable garden and bert watered the flowers 
pretty soon freddie  came back 
did  did danny do anything to you 
the little fellow wanted to know 
no , freddie , but the hose did something to him , said bert 
oh , did it wet him again 
that s what it did 
ha 
ha 
laughed freddie 
i wish i would been here to see it , bert 
well , why did you run 
oh , i  i thought maybe  mamma might want me , answered freddie , but  bert understod , and smiled 
he let freddie finish watering the  flowers , after which freddie played he was a fireman , saving houses from  burning by means of the hose 
snap , the trick dog came running out , followed by flossie , who had just been washed and combed , her mother having put a clean drss on her 
oh , freddie , said the little girl , let s make snap do some tricks 
see if he will jump over the steam of water from the hose 
all right , agreed her little brother 
i will squirt the water out  staight , and you stnd on one side of it and call snap over 
he will jump 
flossie tried this , but at firstthe dog did not seem to want to do this  particular trick 
he played soldier , said his prayers , stod on his  hind legs , and turned a somersault 
he would not jump over the  water 
come , snap , snap 
called flossie 
jump 
snap raced about and barked , and seemed to be having all sorts of fun ,  but jump he would not until he got ready 
when he did freddie  accidentally lowered the nozzle and snap was soaked 
the dog did not mind the water in the least  in fact he seemed to  like it , for the day was warm , and he stod stll and let freddie wet  him all over 
snap rolled about on the lawn , freddie and flossie  taking turns sprinkling 
as might be expected , considerable water got on the two childrn ,  and when snap shook himself , as he often did , to get some of the drps  off his shaggy coat , he gave flossie and her clean drss a regular  shower bath 
nan , coming from the house saw this 
she ran up to flossie , who had the  hose justthen , crying  flossie bobbsey 
oh , you will get it when mamma sees you 
she cleaned  you all up and now look at yourself 
she can t see  there s no looking glass here , said freddie , with a  laugh 
you are justas bad 
cried nan 
you would both better go in the house  right away , and stp playing with the hose 
we are through , anyhow , said freddie 
you ought to see snap jump over  the water 
oh , you childrn 
cried nan , with a shake of her head 
she seemed  like a little mother to them at times , though she was only four years  older 
mr 
bobbsey was very sorry to see flossie so wet and bedrggled , and  said  you should have known better than to play with water with a clean drss  on , flossie 
now i mustpunish you 
you will have to sty in the house  for an hour , and so will freddie 
poor little bobbsey twins 
then it was not a very severe  punishment , and really some was needed 
it was hard when two of their  little playmates came and called for them to come out 
mr 
bobbsey  insistd on the two remaining in until the hour was at an end 
when they had on dr garments , and could go out , there was no one  with whom to play 
i am not going to squirt the hose ever again , said freddie 
neither am i , said his sistr 
never , never 
snap did not say anything 
he lay on the porch asleep , being cooled off  after his sport with the water 
i  i wish we had our cat , snoop , back , said flossie 
we  wouldn t have played in the water 
that s so , agreed freddie 
i wonder where he can be 
they asked their father that night if any of the railroad men had seen  their pet , but he said none had , and added  i am afraid you will have to get along without snoop 
he seems to have  disappeared 
anyhow , you have snap 
some one may come along and claim him , said freddie 
that danny  rugg says he belongs to mr peterson in millville , father , said bert 
well , i will call mr peterson up on the telephone tomorrow , and find  out , spoke mr bobbsey 
that much will be settled , at any rate 
did you hear anything from the circus people about the fat lady 
asked  mr 
bobbsey 
yes , but no news , was her husband s answer 
the circus has gone to  cuba and porto rico for the winter , and i will have to write there 
it  will be some time before we can expect an answer , though , as i suppose  the show will be traveling from place to place and mail down there is  not like it is up here 
we may find the fat lady and the cup some  day 
snoop , too , put in nan 
yes , snoop too 
one fact consoled the bobbseys in their trouble over their lostpet and  cup 
this was the answer received by mr bobbsey from mr peterson 
that gentleman had losta valuable dog , but it was a small poodle , and  unlike big snap 
far no one had claimed the trick dog , and it seemed  likely that the childrn could keep him 
they were very glad about  this 
oh dear 
exclaimed bert , one afternoon a few days following the fun  with the hose , school begins monday 
only three more days of  vacation 
i think you have had a long vacation , returned mr 
bobbsey , and if  freddie and flossie are going to do such tricks as they did the other  day , with the hose , i , for one , shall be glad that you are in school 
i like school , said nan 
there are lot of new girls coming this  term , i hear 
any new fellows 
asked bert , more interestd 
i do not know 
there is a new teacher in the kindergarten , though ,  where flossie and freddie will go 
nellie parks has met her , and says  she is awfully nice 
that s good , spoke flossie 
i like nice teachers 
well , i hope you and freddie will get along well , said mamma bobbsey 
you are getting older you know , and you mustsoon begin to stdy hard 
we will , they promised 
the school bell , next monday morning , called to many rather unwilling  childrn 
the long vacation was over and class days had begun once  more 
the four bobbseys went off together to the building , which was  only a few blocks from their home 
mr tetlow was the principal , and  there were half a dozen lady teachers 
hello , nan , greeted grace lavine 
may i sit with you this term 
oh , i was going to ask her , said nellie parks 
well , i was first spoke grace , with a pout 
we will be in the room where there are three seated desks , said nan with  a smile 
maybe we three can be together 
oh , we will ask teacher 
cried nellie 
that will be lovely 
i am going to sit with freddie , declared flossie 
we are to be  together    mamma said so 
of course , dear , agreed nan 
i will speak to your teacher about it 
bert was walking in the rear with charley mason , when danny rugg came  around a corner 
i know what i am going to do to you after school , bert bobbsey 
called  the bully 
you justwait and see 
a11 right  i will wait spoke bert quietly 
i am not afraid 
by this time they were at the school , and it was nearly time for the  lastbell to ring 
danny went off to join some of his particular chums ,  shaking his fistat bert as he went 
chapter viii bert sees something lessons were not very well learned that firstday in school , but this is  generally the case when the fall term opens after the summer vacation 
justas were the bobbsey twins , nearly all the other pupils were  thinking of what good times they had had in the country , or at the  seashore , and in consequence little attention was paid to reading ,  spelling , arithmetic and geography 
principal tetlow and his teachers were prepared for this , and they  were sure that , in another day or so , the boys and girls would settle  down and do good owrk  sic] 
many of the childrn were in new rooms and  different classes , and this did not make them feel so much at home as  before vacation 
nan bobbsey s firstduty , after reporting to her new teacher , was to go  to the kindergarten room , and ask the teacher there if flossie and  freddie might sit together 
you see , nan explained , this is really their firstreal school work 
they attended a few times before , but did not sty long 
i see , spoke the pretty kindergarten instuctor with a laugh , and we  mustmake it as pleasant for them this time as we can , so they will want  to sty 
yes , my dear , flossie and freddie may sit together , and i will  look after them as much as i can 
oh , there are such a lot of  little tots 
she looked about the room that seemed overflowing with  small boys and girls 
me were playing and talking , telling of their summer experiences 
others seemed frightened , and stod againstthe wall bashfully , little  girls holding to the hands of their little brothers 
nan looked for freddie and flossie 
she saw her little sistr trying to  comfort a small girl who was almostready to cry , while freddie , like  the manly little fellow he was , had taken charge of a small chap in  whose eyes were two large tears , justready to fall 
it was his first day at school 
oh , i am sure your little twin brother and sistr will get along all  right , said the kindergarten teacher , with a smile to nan , as she saw  what flossie and freddie were doing 
they are too cute for anything   the little dears 
they are very good , said nan , only of course they do  things   sometimes 
they wouldn t be real childrn if they did not , answered the teacher 
this was during a recess that had come after the classes were first formed 
on her way back to her room , to see if she could arrange to sit  with grace and nellie at one of the new big desks , nan saw her brother  bert 
he looked a little worried , and nan asked at once  what is the matter , bert 
haven t you got a nice teacher 
oh , yes , she is fine 
exclaimed bert  there s nothing the matter at  all 
yes there is , insistd nan 
i can tell by your face 
it s that  danny rugg 
i am sure 
oh , bert , is he bothering you again 
well , he said he was going to 
why do not you go staight and tell mr tetlow 
he will make danny  behave 
i will go tell him myself 
do not you are  sic] , nan 
cried bert 
all the fellows would call me   sissy ,  if i let you do that 
never mind , i can look out for my self 
i am not afraid of danny 
oh , bert , i hope you do not get into fight 
i won t , nan  if i can help it 
at leasti won t hit first but if he  hits me   bert looked as though he knew what he would do in that case 
oh dear 
cried nan , aren t you boys justawful 
however , she made up her mind that if danny got too bad she would speak  to the principal about him , whether her brother wanted her to or not 
he won t know it , thought nan 
she had no trouble in getting permission from her teacher for herself  and her two friends to sit together , and soon they had moved their books  and other things to one of the long desks that had room for three  pupils 
meanwhile flossie and freddie got along very well in the kindergarten 
at first justas the others did , they gave very little attention to  what the teacher wanted them to learn , but she was very patient , and  soon all the class was gathered about the sand table , in the little low  chairs , making fairy cities , caves , and even makebelieve seashore  places 
this is like the one where we were this summer , said flossie , as she  made a hole in her sand pile to take the place of the ocean 
if i had  water and a piece of wood i could show you where there was a shipwreck ,  she said to the girl next to her 
that isn t the way it was , spoke freddie , from the other side of the  room 
there was more sand at the seashore than on this whole table   yes , on ten tables like this 
there was not 
cried flossie 
there was too 
insistd her brother 
childrn  childrn 
called the teacher 
you mustnot argue like  that  ever  in school , or out of it 
now we will sing our worksong ,  and after that we will march with the flags , and she went to the piano  to play 
all the little ones liked this , and the dispute of flossie and  freddie was soon forgotten 
bert kept thinking of what might happen between himself and danny rugg  when school was out , and when his teacher asked him what the pilgrim  fathers did when they firstcame to settle in new england bert looked up  in surprise , and said  they fought 
fought 
exclaimed the teacher 
the book says they gave thanks 
well , i meant they fought the  er  the indians 
stmmered bert 
poor bert was thinking of what might take place between himself and the  bully 
well , yes , they did fight the indians , admitted the teacher , but that  wasn t what i was thinking of 
i will ask you another queston in  histry 
i am not going to tire you with an account of what went on in the  classrooms 
there were mosty lessons there , such as you have  yourselves , and i know you do not care to read about them 
bert did not see danny rugg at the noon recess , when the bobbsey twins  and the other childrn went home for lunch 
when school was let out  in the afternoon , and when bert was talking to charley mason about a new  way of making a kite , danny rugg , accompanied by several of his chums ,  walked up to bert 
it was in a field some distnce from the school , and  no houses were near 
now i have got you , bert bobbsey 
taunted danny , as he advanced with  doubledup fist 
what did you want to squirt the hose on me that time  for 
i told you it was an accident , said bert quietly 
i say you did it on purpose 
i said i would get even with you , and now  i am going to 
i do not want to fight , danny , said bert quietly 
huh 
he is afraid 
sneered jack westy , one of danny s friends 
yes , he is a coward 
taunted danny 
i am not 
cried bert stutly 
take that 
exclaimed danny , and he gave bert a push that nearly  knocked him down 
bert put out a hand to save himself and stuck danny ,  not really meaning to 
there 
he hit you back 
cried one boy 
yes , go on in , now , dan , and beat him 
oh , i will fix him now , boastd danny , circling around bert 
bert was  carefully watching 
he did not mean to let danny get the bestof him if  he could help it , much as he did not like to fight 
danny stuck bert on the chest and bert hit the bully on the cheek 
danny jumped forward swiftly and tried to give bert a blow on the  head 
bert stpped to one side , and danny slipped down to the  ground 
as he did so a white box fell from his pocket 
bert knew what kind of a  box it was , and what was in it , and he knew now , what had stined  danny s fingers so yellow , and what made his clothes have such a queer  smell 
for the box had in it cigarettes 
danny saw where it had fallen , and picked it up quickly 
he came  running at bert again , but a boy called  look out 
here comes mr tetlow , the principal 
this was a signal for all the boys , even bert , to run , for , though  school was out , they stll did not want to be caught at a fight by one  of the teachers , or mr tetlow 
anyhow , you knocked him down , bert , said charley mason , as he ran on  with bert 
you beat 
he did not  i slipped , said danny 
i can fight him , and i will ,  too , some day 
i am not afraid of you , answered bert 
mr tetlow did not appear to have seen the fight that amounted to so  little 
perhaps he pretended not to 
chapter ix off to the woods whether danny rugg was afraid the principal had seen him trying to force  a fight on bert , or whether the unexpected fall that came to him , caused  it , no one knew , but certainly , for the next few days , danny let bert  alone 
when he passed him he scowled , or shook his fist or muttered  something about getting even , but this was all 
perhaps it was the thought of what bert had seen fall from danny s  pocket that made the bully less anxious to keep up the quarrel 
at any  rate , bert was left alone and he was glad of it 
he was not afraid , but  he liked peace 
the school days went on , and the classes settled down to their work for  the long winter term 
the thought of the snow and ice that would  comparatively soon be with them , made the bobbsey twins rejoice 
charley mason and i are going to make a dandy big bob this year , said  bert one day 
it s going to carry ten fellows 
no girls 
asked nan with a smile 
she was walking along behind  her brother , with grace and nellie 
sure , we will let you girls ride once in a while , said charley , as he  caught up to his chum 
you can t ster 
i stered a bob once , said grace , who was quite athletic for her age 
it was danny rugg s , too 
pooh 
his is a little one alongside the one charley and i are going to  make 
exclaimed bert 
ours will be hard to ster , and it s going to  have a gong on it to tell folks to get out of the way 
that s right , agreed charley 
we would better strt it right away ,  bert 
it may soon snow 
it doesn t feel so now , spoke nan 
it is very warm 
it feels more  like ice cream cones 
if you will come with me i will treat you all to some , exclaimed  nellie parks , whose father was quite well off 
i have some of my  birthday money left 
oh , but there are five of us 
cried nan , counting 
that is too much   twentyfive cents , nellie 
i have got fifty , and really it is very hot today 
it was warm , being the end of september , with indian summer near at  hand 
well , let s go to johnson s , suggestd nellie 
they have the best cream 
oh , here comes flossie and freddie 
exclaimed nan 
we do not want to  take them , nellie 
that means  of course i will take them 
exclaimed nellie , generously 
i have got  fifty cents , i told you 
i will give them each a penny and let them run along home , offered bert 
no , i am going to treat them , too , insistd nellie 
come on 
she  called to the little twins , we are going to get ice cream cones , it s so  warm 
oh , goodie 
cried flossie 
i was justwishing for one 
was i , added her brother 
i will ask you to my party next week , the little girl went on 
i am  going to have one on my birthday 
oh , are you really , flossie 
asked nan 
i hadn t heard about it 
yep  i am 
mamma said i could , but she told me not to tell 
i do not  care , i wanted nellie to know , as she is going to treat us to cones 
it s half my party ,  cause my birthday s the same day , explained  freddie 
you can come to my party at the same time , nellie 
thank you , dear , i shall 
now let s hurry to the stre , for it s  getting warmer all the while 
the ice cream in the funny little cones was much enjoyed by all 
bert  and charley walked on together eating , and talking of the bob sled they  were going to make 
they passed danny rugg , who looked rather enviously  at them 
hey , charley , called danny , come here , i want to speak to you 
i am busy now , answered charley 
bert and i have something to do 
have i 
i have got a dandy plan 
well , i will see you later , spoke charley 
he had once been quite friendly with danny , but he grew not to like his  ways , and so became more chummy with bert , who was very glad , for he  liked charley 
the two boys went on to bert s barn , where they were going to build the  bob sled 
the girls , with flossie and freddie , went on the bobbsey  lawn , where there were some easy chairs 
they sat in the shade of the  trees , and freddie had snap do some of his tricks for the visitors 
can he jump through a hoop , covered with paper as they do in the  circus 
asked nellie 
oh , we never thought to try that , said freddie 
i am going to make  one , and , filled with this new idea , he hurried into the house 
din  , he said , i want some paper and past 
land sakes , chile 
what yo  gwine t  do now 
asked the colored cook 
make a kite , an  take snoop up in de air laik yo  brother bert done  once 
no , we are not going to do that , answered the little boy 
we are  going to cover a hoop with paper , and make snap jump through it , like in  a circus 
m  goodness mustrd pot 
cried din  
what will yo  all be up to  next 
i do not know , answered freddie 
will you make me some past ,  din  
you know we haven t got snoop , anyhow , so we couldn t send  him up on a kite tail , added freddie 
de  me 
yo  chilluns done make me do de moststwuk 
complained  din  , but she laughed , which showed that she did not really mean it ,  and set at mixing some flour and water for the past 
flossie and freddie insistd on making the paper covered hoop  themselves 
they strted , but they got so much of the stcky stff on  their hands and faces that nan feared they would soil their clothes , so  she insistd on being allowed to do the pastng for them 
we can help , can t we 
asked freddie 
yes , said nan 
even for nan covering a hoop with paper was not as easy as she thought  it would be 
grace and nellie helped , but sometimes the wind would blow  the paper away justas they were ready to fold it around the rim of the  hoop 
the past would get on the girls  hands 
what are you doing 
asked bert , as he and charley came from the barn 
they had to stp work on their job , as they could not find a long enough  plank 
the  sic] decided to get one from mr bobbsey s lumber yard ,  later 
we are going to have snap do the circus trick of jumping through a paper  hoop , explained nan 
only we can t seem to get the hoop made 
i will do it , offered bert , and as he and charley had often pastd paper  on their kite frames they had better luck , and soon the hoop was ready 
come , snap 
called freddie , it having been settled that he and flossie  were to hold the hoop for the dog to leap through 
snap , always ready  for fun , jumped up from the grass where he had been sleeping , and  frisked about , barking loudly 
now you hold him there , charley , directed bert , pointing to a spot  back of where freddie and flossie stod 
i will go over here and  call him 
he will come running , and when he gets near enough , freddie ,  you and flossie hold up the paper hoop 
he will go right through it 
it worked out justas the childrn had planned 
snap raced away from  charley , when he heard bert calling 
he ran right between flossie and  freddie , who raised the hoop justin time 
rip 
tear 
burstthe paper , and snap sailed through the hoop justas  he probably had often done in the circus , perhaps from the back of a  horse 
oh , that was fine 
cried flossie 
let s make another hoop 
let s make a lot of  em , and have a circus with snap , and charge money  to see him , and then we can buy a lot of ice cream for our party 
oh , yes 
agreed his sistr 
well , they did make more hoops , and snap seemed to enjoy jumping through  them 
when mr 
bobbsey heard about the circus plans she decided it  would make too much confusion 
besides , you have to help me get ready for your party , she said to the  two little twins 
this took their mind off the proposed circus , but for several days after  that they had much fun making hoops for snap to jump through 
bert and charley got a long plank from the lumber yard , and spent much  time after school in the bobbsey barn , working over their bob sled 
it  was harder than they had thought it would be , and they had to call in  some other boys to help them 
mr bobbsey , too , gave his son some  advice about how to build it 
flossie and freddie liked it very much in school 
the kindergarten  teacher was very kind , and took an interestin all her pupils 
oh ,  mamma 
cried flossie , coming in one day from school , i have learned how  to make a house 
i can make a lantern , and a chain to hang it on , and i can put it  in front of flossie s house 
exclaimed freddie 
please , mother ,  may i have some bread and jam 
i am awful hungry 
yes , dear , go ask din  , said mr 
bobbsey , with a smile 
then  you may show me how you make houses and lanterns and a chain 
are they  real 
no , said flossie , they are only paper , but they look nice 
i am sure they must said their mother 
after each of the twins had been given a large slice of bread and butter  and jam , they showed the latestthing they had learned at school 
flossie did manage to cut out a house , that had a chimney on it , and a  door , besides two windows 
freddie took several little narrow stips of paper , and pastng the ends  together , made a lot of rings 
each ring before being pastd , was  slipped into another , and soon he had a paper chain 
to make the  lantern he used a piece of paper made into a roll , with slits all around  the middle of it where the light would have come out had there been a  candle in it 
the handle was a narrow slip of paper pastd over the  top of the lantern 
very fine indeed , said mamma bobbsey 
run out now to play 
if you  sty in the house too much you will soon lose all the lovely tan you got  in the country , and at the seashore 
childrn , said the principal to the bobbseys and all the others in  school the next day , i have a little treat for you 
tomorrow will be a  holiday , and , as the weather is very warm , we will close the school at  noon , and go off in the woods for a little picnic 
oh , good 
cried a number of the boys and girls , and , though it was  againstthe rules to speak aloud during the school hours , none of the  teachers objected 
i expect you all to have perfect marks from now until friday , mr  tetlow went on 
you may bring your lunches to school with you friday  morning , if your parents will let you , and we will leave here at noon ,  and go to ward s woods 
it was rather hard work to stdy after such good news , but , somehow , the  pupils managed it 
finally friday came , and nearly every boy and girl  came to school with a basket or bundle holding his or her lunch 
mr 
bobbsey put up two baskets for her childrn , nan taking one and bert the  other 
oh , we will have a lovely time 
cried freddie , dancing about on his  little fat legs 
twelve o clock came , and with each teacher at the head of her class , and  mr tetlow marching in front of all , the whole school strted off for  the woods 
chapter x a scare the way to the woods where the little school outing was to be held ran  close to the road on which the bobbsey house stod 
as freddie and  flossie , with nan and bert , marched along with the others , freddie cried  out  0h , i hope we see mamma , and then we can wave to her 
yes , and maybe she will come with us , suggestd flossie 
wouldn t that  be nice 
pooh 
exclaimed bert 
mamma s too busy to come to a picnic today 
she is expecting company 
yes , added nan , the ministr and his wife are coming , and mamma s  cooking a lot of things 
why , does a ministr eat more than other folks 
asked freddie 
if  they does , i am going to be a ministr when i grow up 
i thought you were going to be a fireman , said bert 
well , i can be a fireman week days and a ministr on sundays , said the  little fellow , thus solving the problem 
do they eat so much ,  nan 
no , of course not , only mamma wants to be polite to them , so she has a  lot of things cooked up , so that if they do not like one thing they can  have another 
folks always give their bestto the ministr 
i am surely going to be one , too , declared flossie 
i like good  things to eat 
i hope our ministr isn t very hungry ,  cause then  there will be some left for us when we come home from this picnic 
why , flossie 
cried nan 
we have a lovely lunch with us 
plenty , i am  sure 
well , i am awful hungry , nan , said the little girl 
besides , sammie  jones , and his sistr julia , haven t any lunch at all 
i saw them , and  they looked terrible hungry 
couldn t we give them some of ours 
if we  have so much at home 
of course we could , and it is very kind of you to think of them , said  nan , as she patted her little sistr on her head 
i will look after  sammie and julia when we get to the grove 
in spite of what nan and bert had said about mr 
bobbsey being very  busy , flossie and freddie looked anxiously in the direction of their  house as they walked along 
no sight of their mother greeted them 
they did see a friend , however , and this was none other than snap , their  new dog , who , with many barks and wags of his fluffy tail , ran out to  meet his little mastrs and mistesses 
here , snap 
snap 
called freddie 
come on , old fellow 
the dog  leaped all about him 
let s take him to the picnic with us , suggestd flossie 
we can have  lots of fun 
he can eat the scraps , said nan 
shall we , bert 
i do not care 
maybe mr tetlow wouldn t like it 
you ask him , bert , pleaded flossie 
tell him snap will do tricks to amuse us 
bert goodnaturedly strted  ead to speak to the principal , who was  talking with some of the teachers , planning games for the little folk 
flossie and freddie were patting their pet , when danny rugg , and one of  his friends came along 
that dog can t come to our picnic 
he  might bite some of us 
snap never bites 
cried freddie 
of course not , said flossie 
well , he can t come to this picnic 
spoke danny , angrily 
go on  home 
he cried , sharply , stoping to pick up a stne 
snap growled and  showed his teeth 
there 
cried danny 
i told you he would bite 
he will not , danny rugg 
exclaimed nan , who had gone up front for a  minute to speak to some of the older girls 
he only growled because  you acted mean to him 
now you leave him alone , or i will tell mr tetlow  on you 
pooh 
think i care 
i say no dog can come to our picnic 
go on  home 
with raised hand danny approached snap 
again the dog  growled angrily 
he was not used to being treated in this way 
look out , danny rugg , said nan , severely , or he may jump on you , and  knock you down 
he wouldn t bite you , though , mean as you are , unless i  told him to do so 
i am not afraid of you 
cried danny , more angry than before 
i will get  a stck and then we will see what will happen , and he looked about for  one 
do not let danny beat snap 
pleaded flossie , tears coming into her  eyes 
i won t , said nan , looking about anxiously for bert 
she saw him  coming back , and felt better 
by this time danny had found a club , and  was coming back to where flossie , freddie and nan , with some of their  friends , were walking along , snap in their midst i will make that dog go home now 
cried danny 
i am not going to get  bitten , and have hyperfobia , or whatever you call it 
i will tell mr  tetlow if you do not make him go home 
oh , do not be so smart 
exclaimed bert , stpping out from behind a  group of girls 
i have told mr tetlow myself that snap is following us ,  and he said to let him come along 
you needn t take the trouble ,  danny rugg 
if you try to hit our dog i will have something more to  say , and bert stpped boldly forth 
huh 
i am not afraid of you , sneered danny , but he let the club drp ,  and walked off with his own particular chums 
did mr tetlow say snap could come 
asked freddie , anxiously 
yes 
he said he would be good to drve away the cows if they bothered us ,  answered bert , with a smile 
after this little trouble , the bobbseys and their friends went on toward  the grove in the woods where the picnic was to be held 
there was  laughing and shouting , and much fun on the way , in which snap shared 
boys and girls would run to one side or the other of the path to gather  late flowers 
me would pick up odd stnes , or pine cones , and others  would find curious little creeping or crawling things which they called  their friends to see 
each teacher had charge of her special class , but she did not look too  closely after them , for it was a day to be happy and free from care ,  with no thought of school or lessons 
we will make snap do some tricks when we get to the grove , said flossie 
yes , we will have a little circus , added her brother 
can he stnd on his head 
one girl wanted to know 
well , he can turn a somersault , and he is on his head for a second while  he is doing that , explained freddie , proudly 
can he roll over and over 
a boy wanted to know 
we had a dog , once ,  that could 
snap can , too , said flossie 
roll over , snap 
she ordered , and the  dog , with a bark , did so 
the childrn laughed and some clapped their  hands 
they thought snap was about the bestdog they had ever seen 
no accidents happened on the way to the grove , except that one little  boy tried to cross a brook on some stnes , instad of the plank which  the others used 
he slipped in and got his feet wet , but as the day was  warm no one worried much 
finally the grove was reached 
it was in a wooded valley , with hills on  either side , and a cold , clear spring of water at one end , where  everyone could get a drnk 
that always seems to be what is most wanted at a picnic    a drnk of water 
mr tetlow called all the childrn together , before letting them go off  to play , and told them at what time the strt for home would be made , so  that they would not be late in coming back to the meeting place 
now , he said , have the bestfun you can 
play anything you wish   school games if you like  but do not get too warm or excited 
do not go too far away 
you may eat your luncheon when you like 
let s eat ours now , suggestd flosssie 
i am awful hungry 
am i , said freddie 
nan and bert decided that the little ones  might at leasthave a sandwich and a piece of cake 
nor did they forget  the two little jones childrn , who had no lunch 
the bobbseys were well  provided and soon sammie and julia were smiling and happy as they sat  beneath a tree , eating 
came all sorts of games , from tag and jumping rope , to blindman s  bluff and hideandseek 
snap was made to do a number of tricks , much  to the amusement of the teachers and childrn 
danny rugg , and some of  the older boys , got up a small baseball game , and then danny , with one  or two chums , went off in a deeper part of the woods 
bert heard one of  the boys ask another if he had any matches 
i know what they are going to do , whispered bert to nan 
what 
she asked 
smoke cigarettes 
i saw danny have a pack 
nan was much shocked , but she did not see anything 
she was glad bert  did not smoke 
bert went off with some boys to see if they could catch any fish in the  deeper part of the brook , about half a mile from the picnic grove , and  nan , with one or two girls about her own age , took a little walk with  flossie and freddie to gather some late wild flowers that grew on the  side of one of the hills 
they found a number of the blossoms , and were making pretty bouquets of  them , when freddie , who had gone on a little  ead of the rest came  running back so fastthat he nearly rolled to the bottom of the hill , so  fat and chubby was he 
what s the matter 
what is it 
asked nan , catching her brother just in time 
up there 
he gasped 
it s up there 
a great big black one 
a big black what  bug 
asked nan , ready to laugh 
no 
a big black snake 
i almoststpped on it 
a snake 
oh , dear 
screamed the girls 
call mr tetlow 
he is got a book about snakes , and  he will know what to do 
come on 
cried nellie parks 
i am going to run 
am i 
added grace lavine 
oh , it may chase us 
in fright the childrn turned , freddie looking back at the spot where he  thought he had seen the snake 
chapter xi danny s trick nan bobbsey stod for a moment , she hardly knew why 
perhaps she wanted  to see the big snake of which freddie spoke 
it certainly was not  because she liked reptiles 
she thought she saw something long and black wiggling toward her ,  and , with a little exclamation of fright , she , too , turned to follow the  others 
as she did so , she saw their dog snap come running up the  hill , barking and wagging his tail 
he seemed to have lostthe childrn  for a moment and to be telling them how glad he was that he had found  them again 
staight up the hill , toward where freddie had said the snake was ,  rushed snap 
here 
come back 
do not go there 
cried nan 
no , do not let him  he may be bitten 
added flossie 
come here ,  snap 
snap evidently did not want to mind 
on up the hill he rushed ,  pausing now and then to dig in the earth 
nearer and nearer he came to  where the little bobbsey boy had said the snake was hiding in the grass  and bushes 
oh , snap 
snap 
cried freddie 
do not go there 
snap kept on ,  and freddie , afraid lesthis pet dog be bitten , caught up a stne and  threw it at the place 
his aim was pretty good , but instad of scaring  away the snake , or drving back snap , the fall of the stne only made  snap more eager to see what was there that his friends did not want him  to get 
with a loud bark he rushed on , and the childrn , turning to look , saw  something long and black , and seemingly wiggling , come toward them 
oh , the snake 
the snake 
cried nan 
run 
run 
shouted grace 
come on 
exclaimed nellie parks , in loud tones 
freddie 
freddie 
called flossie , afraid lesther little brother be  bitten 
snap rushed at the black thing so fiercely that he turned a somersault  down the hill , and rolled over and over 
he did not mind this , and  in an instnt was up again 
once more he rushed at the black object ,  but the childrn did not watch to see what happened , for they were  running away as fastas they could 
freddie , anxious as to what would become of snap if he fought a  snake , looked back 
he saw a stange sight 
the dog had in his mouth  the long , black thing , and was running with it toward the bobbseys and  their friends 
oh , nan 
nan 
look 
look 
cried freddie 
snap has the snake 
he is bringing it to us 
oh , he must t do that 
shouted nan 
it may bite him or us 
run 
run fastr 
shrieked grace 
even though it was down hill the childrn could not run as fastas  snap , and he soon caught up to them 
running on a little way  ead he  drpped the black thing 
instad of wiggling or trying to bite , it  was i very stll 
it  it s dead , said nan 
snap has killed it 
freddie was braver now 
he went closer 
why  why 
he exclaimed 
it isn t a snake at all 
it s only an old  black root of a tree , all twistd up like a snake 
look , nan   flossie 
taking courage , the girls went up to look 
snap stod over it , wagging  his tail as proudly as though he had captured a real snake 
as freddie  had said , it was only a tree root 
it did look a lot like a snake in the grass , said the little  fellow 
it musthave , agreed nan 
it looked like one even when snap had it 
i am glad it wasn t 
am i , spoke grace , and nellie made like remark 
snap frisked about , barking as though to ask praise for what he had  done 
he is a good dog , observed freddie , hearing which the animal almost wagged his tail off 
if it had been a real snake he would have gotten  it 
wouldn t you 
went on the little boy 
if barks meant anything , snap said , with all his heart , that he  certainly would  that not even a dozen snakes could frighten a big dog  like him 
the childrn soon got over the little scare , and went back up the hill  again to gather more flowers 
snap went with them this time , running  about here and there 
if there are any real snakes , said freddie , he will scare them away 
i guess there aren t any 
i hope not , said nan , but she and the others kept a sharp lookout 
however , there was no further fright for them , and soon , with their  hands filled with blossoms the bobbseys and the others went back to the  main party 
me of the teachers were arranging games with their pupils , and nan ,  flossie and freddie joined in , having a good time 
when it was  almosttime to strt for home , mr tetlow blew loudly on a whiste he  carried to call in the stagglers 
where s bert 
asked flossie , looking about for her older brother 
i guess he hasn t come back from fishing yet , said nan 
come ,  flossie and freddie , i have a little bit of lunch left , and you might as  well eat it , so you won t be hungry on the way home 
the littler bobbsey twins were glad enough to do this 
they had to  have a drnk , and nan went with them to the spring , carrying a glass  tumbler she had brought 
this isn t like our nice silver cup that the fat lady took in the  train , said freddie , as he passed the glass of water very carefully to  flossie 
no , she said , after she had taken her drnk 
i wonder if papa will  ever get that back 
he said , the other day , remarked nan , as she got some water for  freddie , that he hadn t heard from the circus yet 
i think he  will 
it isn t like snoop , our cat 
we do not know where he is , but  we are pretty sure the fat lady has the cup 
poor snoop 
cried freddie , as he thought of the fine black cat 
maybe some of the railroad men have him 
maybe , agreed flossie 
when they got back to where the teachers and principal were , bert and  the boys who bad gone fishing had returned 
they had one or two small  fish 
i am going to have mamma cook them for my supper , said bert , proudly  holding up those he had caught 
they are too small    there won t be anything left of them after  they are cleaned , said nan , who was quite a little housekeeper 
oh , yes , there will , declared her brother 
i am going fishing again  tomorrow and , catch more 
mr tetlow was going about among the teachers , asking if all their  pupils were on hand , ready for the march back 
danny rugg and some of  his close friends were missing 
they ought not to have gone off so far , said mr tetlow , as he blew  several times on the whiste 
on danny and the other boy , were seen  coming from a distnt part of the grove 
one of the boys , harry white ,  looked very pale , and not at all well 
what is the matter 
asked mr tetlow , and he looked curiously at danny  and the others , and sniffed the air as though he smelled something 
i  i guess i ate too many  apples , said harry , in a faint voice 
we found an orchard , and  i told you not to go into orchards , and take fruit , said mr tetlow ,  severely 
the man said we could , remarked danny 
we asked him 
you should not have eaten so many , said mr tetlow 
i can t see  how ripe apples , which are the only kind there are this time of year   could make you ill unless you ate too many , and he looked at danny and  harry sharply 
they did not answer 
the march home was not as joyful as the one to the grove had been , for  mostof the childrn were tired 
they all had had a fine time , and  there were many request of the teachers to have another picnic the next  week 
oh , we can t have them every week , my dears , said miss franklin , who  had charge of flossie , freddie and some others in the kindergarten  class 
besides , it will soon be too cool to go out in the woods 
in a  little while we will have ice and snow , and thanksgiving and christas 
that will be better than picnics , said freddie 
i am going to have a  new sled 
i am going to get a new doll , that can walk , declared flossie , and then  she and the others talked about the coming holidays 
at school several days in the following week little was talked of except  the picnic , the snake scare from the old tree root , the catching of the  fish , and the illness of harry white , for that boy was quite sick by the  time town was reached , and mr tetlow called a carriage to send him  home 
i can guess what made him sick too , said bert to nan , privately 
what 
she asked 
smoking cigarettes 
how do you know 
because when i and some of the other fellows were fishing we saw danny  and his crowd smoking in the woods 
they offered us some , but we  wouldn t take any 
harry said he was sick then , but danny only laughed  at him 
that danny rugg is a bad boy , said nan , severely 
she was soon to  see how much meaner danny could be 
workmen had recently finished putting some new water pipes , and a place  for the childrn to drnk , in the school yard , and one morning , speaking  to the whole school , mr tetlow made a little speech , warning the  childrn not to play with the faucets , and spray the water about , as  some had done , in fun 
whoever is caught playing with the faucets in the yard after this will  be severely punished , he said 
as it happened , flossie and freddie were not at school that day , freddie  having a slight sore throat 
his mother kept him home , and flossie  would not go without him 
they did not hear the warning , and bert  and nan did not think to tell the smaller childrn of it 
two days later freddie was well enough to go back to class , and flossie  accompanied him 
it was at the morning recess when , as freddie went to  get a drnk at one of the new faucets , danny saw him 
a gleam of  mischief came into the eyes of the school bully 
want to see the water squirt , freddie 
asked danny 
that s a new  kind of faucet 
it squirts awful far 
does it 
asked freddie , innocently 
how do you make it 
he had no  idea it was forbidden fun 
justput your thumb over the hole , and turn the water on , directed  danny 
you , too , flossie 
it won t hurt you 
danny looked all around , thinking he was unobserved as he gave this bad  advice 
naturally , freddie and flossie , being so young , suspected  nothing 
they covered the opening of the faucet with their thumbs , and  turned on the water 
it spurted in a fine spray , and they laughed in  glee 
that they wet each other did not matter 
danny , seeing the success of his trick , walked off as he saw mr tetlow  coming 
the bobbsey twins were so intent on spurting the water that  they did not observe the principal until he was close to them 
they strted as he called out sharply  freddie 
flossie 
stp that 
you know that it is forbidden 
go to  my office at once and i will come and see you later 
you will be  punished for this 
with tears in their eyes the little twins obeyed 
they could not  understnd it 
chapter xii the childrn s party when mr tetlow , a little later , entered his office he found flossie and  freddie stnding by one of the windows , looking out on the other  childrn marching to their classrooms 
they had cried a little , but had  stpped now 
i am very sorry to have to punish you two twins , said the principal ,  but i had given stict orders that no one was to play with that water 
why did you do it 
because , answered flossie 
danny rugg told us to , added freddie 
he said it was a new kind of  faucet 
now be careful , warned mr tetlow 
often before he had heard pupils  say that someone else told them to break certain rules 
are you sure  about this 
he asked 
yes 
sir , said freddie , eagerly 
danny told us to do it 
did not you know it was forbidden 

no , sir , answered flossie 
why , i spoke of it in all the rooms 
we wasn t here yestrday or the day before , said flossie 
freddie  was sick 
mr tetlow began to understnd 
i will look this up , he said , and if find  he was interrupted by a boy from one of the higher classes coming in  with a note from his teacher 
she wanted a new box of chalk 
when you go back , george , said the principal to the boy , as he gave  him what the teacher had sent for , go to miss hegan s class , and have  her send danny rugg to me 
flossie and freddie say he told them to  spray water with one of the new faucets 
yes , sir , he did 
exclaimed george 
i heard him , but i did not think  they would do it 
he did tell them 
at this unexpected information mr tetlow was much surprised 
if that is the case , danny is the one to be punished , he said 
i am  sorry , flossie and freddie , that i suspected you 
you may go back to  your class , and i will write your teacher a note , saying you may go out  half an hour  ead of the others to make up for coming to my office 
after this , no matter whether anyone tells you or not , do not spray  the water 
no , sir , we won t 
exclaimed the bobbsey twins , now happy again 
danny rugg was punished by being kept in after school for several days ,  and mr tetlow sent home a note to his father , explaining what a mean  trick the bully had played 
i wish i had heard danny telling you that  justto get you in  trouble , said bert , when he was told of what had happened 
i would have  fixed him 
oh , do not get into any more fights , begged nan 
bert did not come to blows with danny over this latesttrouble , but he  did tell the bully , very plainly , what he thought of him , and said if  danny ever did a thing like that again that he would not get off so  easily 
oh , i am not afraid of you , sneered danny 
lessons and fun made up many school days for the bobbsey twins 
as  the fall went on , lessons grew a little harder 
even freddie and  flossie , young as they were , had little tasks to do that kept them busy 
they liked their school and the teacher , and many were the queer  stries they brought home of the happenings in the classroom 
it was now toward the end of october , and the weather was getting  cooler , though during the day it was stll very warm at times 
the  twins , as did their friends , looked forward to the coming of winter and  the christas holidays 
thanksgiving , too , would be a time of rejoicing and of good things to  eat , and this occasion was to be made more of than usual this time , for  some boys and girls the bobbseys had met in the country and at the  seashore were to be invited to spend a few days in lakeport 
before this there was another event down on the program 
this was  to be a party for flossie and freddie , the occasion being their joint  birthdays 
we are going to have candy 
cried freddie , when the arrangements  were talked over 
ice cream    added flossie    a whole freezer full 
aren t we ,  mamma 
well , i guess a small freezer full won t be any too much , said mr 
bobbsey , smiling 
i hope none of you eat enough to make yourselves  ill 
we won t , promised freddie and flossie 
there were busy times in the home of the twins the next few days , for  though nan and bert s birthdays were not to be observed , stll they were  to have their part in the jolly celebration 
invitations were sent out , on little sheets of note paper , adorned with  flowers , and in cute little envelopes 
flossie and freddie took them to  the postffice themselves 
my 
what a lot of mail 
exclaimed the clerk at the stmp window , as he  saw the childrn drpping the invitations into the slot 
uncle sam  will have to get some extra men to carry that around , i guess 
what s  it all about 
we are going to have a party , said flossie , proudly 
justthen danny rugg came into the postffice 
a party 
eh 
he sneered 
i am coming to it , i am 
i am going to  have two plates of ice cream 
you are not 
cried freddie 
my mamma wouldn t let a boy like you  come to our party 
specially not after what you did  telling us to play in the water ,  added freddie 
you can t come 
yes , i can , insistd danny , justto tease the childrn 
for a moment flossie and freddie almostbelieved him , he seemed so much  in earnestabout it 
you can t come you haven t any invitation , said flossie , suddenly 
i will take one of those you put in the box , went on the mean boy 
he won t dare  will he 
freddie appealed to the mail clerk 
i should say not 
if he does uncle  sam will be after him 
well , i am coming to that party all the same 
insistd danny , with a  grin on his freckled face 
flossie and freddie were so worried about him that they told their  mother , but she assured them that danny would not come to spoil their  fun 
finally the afternoon and evening of the party arrived , for the little  folks were to come justbefore supper , play some games , eat , and then  sty until about nine o clock 
flossie and freddie had been drssed in their prettiestclothes , and nan  and bert also attired for the affair 
the ice cream had come from the  stre , all packed in ice and salt , and din  had set it out on the back  stop , where it would be cooler 
din  was very busy that day 
she hurried about here and there , helping  mr 
bobbsey 
sam , her husband , also had plenty to do 
i  clar t  gracious goodness 
din  exclaimed , i su  will get thin  ef dish ye  keeps up 
i ain t set down a minute dis blessed day 
my  feet will drp off soon i  specs 
will they , really , din  
asked freddie 
can we watch  em fall 
bress yo  hearts , honeys 
exclaimed the colored cook , i did not mean  it jestdat way 
suffin s su  gwine t  happen    i feels it in  m  bones 
something was to happen , though not exactly what din  expected 
finally all was in readiness for the guest 
the good things to eat  were in the kitchen , all but the ice cream , which , as i have said , was  out on the back porch 
flossie and freddie had gone to the front door  nearly a dozen times to see if any of the guest were in sight 
snap ,  as a special favor , had been allowed to sty in the house that  afternoon , for the twins were going to make him do tricks for their  friends 
there came a ring at the door bell 
here they come 
here they come 
cried flossie 
let me answer , too , cried freddie , and they both hurried through the  front hall to greet the firstguestat their party 
chapter xiii an unpleasant surprise quickly , after the firstguest had arrived came the others 
nellie  parks , grace lavine friends of nan , and willie porter and his sistr  sadie , came first and freddie and flossie let them in , the porter  childrn being some of their bestiked playmates 
all the childrn wore their bestclothes , and for a time they were a bit  stff and unnatural , stnding shyly about in corners , againstthe walls ,  or sitting on chairs 
the boys seemed to all crowd together in one part of the room , and the  girls in another 
flossie and freddie , nan and bert , were so busy  answering the door that they did not notice this at first but aunt sar  , their mother s sistr , who had come over to help mr 
bobbsey , looking in the parlor and library , saw what the trouble was 
my 
she cried , with a goodnatured laugh , as she noticed how stff  the childrn were 
this will never do 
you are not that way at school ,  i do not believe 
come , be lively 
mix up  play games 
pretend this  is recess at school , and make as much noise as you like 
for a moment the boys and girls did not know what to think of this  invitation 
justthen snap , the circus dog , came in the room , and ,  with a bark of welcome , he turned a somersault , and then marched around  on his hind legs , carrying a broomstck like a gun  pretending he was a  soldier 
bert had given it to him 
how the childrn laughed and clapped their hands 
snap barked  so loudly  for he liked applause that there was noise enough for even  jolly aunt sar  
after that there was no trouble 
the boys and girls  talked together and soon they were playing games , and having the best kind of fun 
for some of the games simple prizes had been offered and it was quite  exciting toward the end to see who would win 
flossie and freddie  thought they had never had such a good time in all their lives 
nan and  bert were enjoying themselves , too , with their friends , who were  slightly older than those who had been asked for the younger bobbsey  twins 
going to jerusalem , was one game that created lots of enjoyment 
a  number of chairs were placed in the centre of the room , and the boys and  girls marched around them while mr 
bobbsey played the piano 
there was one less chair than there were players , so that when the music  would suddenly stp , which was a signal for each one who could , to sit  down , someone was sure to be left 
this one had to sty out of the  game 
a chair would be taken away , so as always to have one less than the  number of players , and the game went on 
it was great fun , scrambling  to see who would get a seat , and not be left without one , and finally  there was but one chair left , while grace lavine and john blake marched  about 
mr 
bobbsey kept playing quite some time , as the two went  around and around that one chair 
everyone was laughing , wondering who  would get a seat and so win the game , when , all at once , mr 
bobbsey  stpped the music 
she had her back turned so it would be perfectly  fair 
grace and john made a rush for the one chair , but grace got to it first  and so she won 
well , i am glad you did , anyhow , said john , politely 
other games were peanut races and potato scrambles 
in the first each player had a certain number of peanuts and they had to strt at one  end of the room , and lay the nuts at equal distnces apart across to the  other side , coming back each time to their pile of peanuts to get one 
metimes a boy would slip , he was in such a hurry , or a girl would drp  her peanuts , and this made fun and confusion 
nan won this race easily 
in the potato scramble several rows of potatoes were made across the  room 
each player was given a large spoon , and whoever firsttook up all his or her potatoes in the spoons one at a time , and piled  them up at the far end of the room , won the game 
in this charley mason  was successful , and won the prize    a pretty little pin for his tie 
the afternoon wore on , and , almostbefore the childrn realized it the  hour for supper had arrived 
they were not sorry , either , for they all  had good appetites 
come into the dining room , childrn , invited mr 
bobbsey 
oh 
such gasps of pleased surprise as were heard when the childrn  saw what had been prepared for them 
for mr and mr 
bobbsey , while  not going to any great expense , and not making the childrn s party too  fanciful , had made it beautiful and simple 
the long table was set with dishes and pretty glasses 
there were  flowers in the centre , and at each end , and also blooms in vases about  the room 
from the centre chandelier to the four corners of the  table , were stings of green smilax in which had been entwined  carnations of various colors 
the lights were softly glowing on the pretty scene , and there were  prettily shaded candles to add to the effect 
what caught the eyes  of all the childrn more than anything else were two large cakes  one  at either end of the table 
on each cake burned five candles , and on one cake was the name  flossie , while the other was marked freddie 
the names were in pink  icing on top of the white frostng that covered the birthday cakes 
oh 
oh 
oh 
could be heard all about the room 
isn t that too  sweet for anything 
i guess they are sweet 
piped up freddie in his shrill little voice ,   cause din  put lots of sugar in  em 
did not you , din  
he  looked at din  , who had thrusther laughing , black , goodnatured face  into the dining room door 
dat s what i did , honey 
dat s what i did 
she exclaimed 
if  anybody s got a toofache he would better not eat any ob dem cakes ,  cause  dey su  am sweet 
how the childrn laughed at that 
all ready , now , childrn , sit down , said mr 
bobbsey 
your names  are at your plates 
there was a little confusion getting them all seated , as those on one  side of the table found that their name cards were on the other side 
flossie and freddie , and nan and bert , helped the guest to find  their proper places and soon everyone was in his or her chair 
can t snap sit with us , too 
asked freddie , looking about for his pet ,  who had done all his tricks well that evening 
no , dear , said mr 
bobbsey 
snap is a good dog , but we do not want  him in the dining room when we are eating 
it gives him bad habits 
can t i send him out some cakes 
asked flossie , for snap had  almostas large a sweet tooth as the childrn themselves 
yes , as it is your birthday , i suppose you can give him some of your  good things , said mamma bobbsey 
here , din  
called freddie to the cook , as he piled a plate full of  cakes 
please give these to snap 
land sakes goodness me alive 
cried din  
dat su  am queer 
feedin  a dog jestlaik a human at a party 
i can t bring m self to  it , nohow 
i will take  em out to him , said her husband 
the feastbegan , and such a feastas it was 
mr 
bobbsey , knowing  how easily the delicate stmachs of childrn can be upset , had wisely  selected the food and sweets , and she saw to it that no one ate too  much , though she was gently suggestve about it instad of ordering 
do not eat too much , advised freddie to some of the friends who sat  near him 
we have got a lot of ice cream coming 
save room for that 
that s so  i almostforgot , spoke jimmie black 
a little later mr 
bobbsey said to din   i think you may bring in the cream now , and i will help you serve it 
yes , ma am 
oh , goodie 
cried freddie 
ice cream s coming 
he waved his  spoon above his head 
freddie  freddie 
din  went out on the back stop , looked around and came running back to  the dining room , where mr 
bobbsey was 
din  s eyes were big with  wonder and surprise 
mr 
bobbsey 
mr 
bobbsey 
she cried 
suffin s done gone an   happened 
what is it 
asked mamma bobbsey , quickly 
is anyone hurt 
no m , but dat ice cream freezer hate jestgone and walked right off de  back stop , an  it ain t dere at all , nohow 
de ice cream is all gone 
the childrn looked at one another with pained surprise showing on their  faces 
the ice cream was gone 
chapter xiv a coat button astnishment , surprise and disappointment were so great for a few  seconds after the discovery that the bestpart of the party  the ice  cream  was gone , that no one knew , what to say 
flossie burstout  with  are you sure , din  
maybe it fell off the porch 
deed an  it did not , honey gal 
i done looked eberywhar fo  dat  freezer , an  it s jestgone complete 
maybe snap took it , suggestd freddie , as a lasthope 
once he took  my book and hid it 
snap , did you take the ice cream 
snap barked and wagged his tail , looking rather pained at being asked  such a queston 
no , indeedy , snap couldn t take off a big freezer like dat , declared  din  
it wasn t snap 
who could it have been 
asked nan 
everyone had stpped eating  while this talk went on 
who could have taken our ice cream 
dat s what i do not know , honey , answered the colored cook 
dat s why  i comed in he  to tell yo  mamma 
i  spects , mr 
bobbsey , dat we would  better phonograph fo  de police 
phonograph  i guess you mean telephone 
do not you , din  
asked mr 
bobbsey , with a smile 
yes m , dat s what i done mean 
or else maybe we kin send m  man sam  down to de sttion house fo   em 
no , i had better telephone , in case it is necessary 
perhaps i had  better take a look out there 
perhaps the man from the stre may have  set the cream off to one side 
no m , he did not do dat 
i took p ticlar notice where he set it 
dere s a wet ringmark on de porch where de freezer was ,  count of de  salty water leakin  out 
an  dat wet ringmark am all dat s left ob de  cream , dar now 
din  , stnding with her hands on her hips , looked  at the strtled childrn , whose mouths were justready for the ice  cream 
well , i am going to have a look , anyhow , said bert 
come on , charley 
maybe , after all , that danny rugg is up to some of his tricks 
i am with you , bert 
cried charley 
we ought to have some sort of  a light 
it s dark out 
i will get my little pocket electric light , said bert 
he had one , and  it gave a good light 
he went to his room for it 
flossie and freddie did not know what to do 
that their lovely party  should be spoiled by the missing ice cream seemed too bad to be true 
mamma , if we can t find this ice cream , can t we buy more 
flossie  wanted to know 
the girls justwant some  so bad 
the boys , too , added freddie 
oh , i guess we will manage to get some fo you , if we can t find this ,  answered mr 
bobbsey 
we may have to wait a little while for it ,  though 
well , we will have a look , said bert , as he came down with his little  electric lamp 
me of his own particular chums , including charley  mason , followed him out to the back porch , din  was in her kitchen ,  looking behind tables , under the sink , in the pantry and all about ,  hoping that , somehow or other , the freezer might have gotten in there 
it was not to be found 
well , here s where it stod , said bert , as he looked at the round , wet  mark on the porch where the freezer had set 
he flashed his torch on  it , and then cried out  and look , boys , here are some spots of water that musthave leaked from  the wooden tub that holds the tin freezer 
see , the water has drpped  down on each stp 
this is the way they carried off our ice cream 
the others could see a trail of water drps leading from the stop down  the stps and along the stne walk at the side of the bobbsey house 
now we can follow and see justwhere they took our cream 
cried bert 
this is the way indians used to trail the white settlers 
let me come 
cried freddie , hearing this 
i want to help hunt  whoever took our ice cream 
no , you would better sty back there , said bert 
why 
his little brother wanted to know 
because it might be  tramps  who have it , and there would be trouble ,  said bert 
wait until i get my cap pistl 
cried freddie 
i can scare a tramp  with that 
no , you go back there , and sty in the house , went on bert 
if we  find tramps have it , we will get a policeman 
it might be that a tramp did stal up on the stps , and lift off the  freezer , said mr 
bobbsey 
bert , be careful , she called to her son ,  who set off in the darkness with his chums , flashing his electric light  from time to time 
i will look out 
he called back 
for some distnce it was easy to see which way the ice cream freezer had  been carried , for there were the marks of the drpping water 
these stpped about the middle of the sidewalk , and seemed to go over in  the grass 
we can t see  em now , spoke charley 
that s too bad 
well , we will keep on this way in a staight line , suggestd bert 
maybe they took the freezer down back of our berry bushes to eat the  cream 
i hope they left some , said john anderson , in a mournful sort of  voice 
hurrying on after bert , the boys looked eagerly about in the darkness  for a sign of the missing ice cream 
there were not many chances of  them finding it , for though bert s electric torch gave a brilliant light  for a short distnce , it was not very large 
what s over there 
asked charley , pausing and pointing to a patch of  blackness 
an old barn , that we used to use before we had our new one built ,  answered bert 
why 
well , maybe they took the ice cream in there to eat it , went on  charley 
is it open 
yes , it s never locked 
say , we will take a look in there , anyhow 
exclaimed bert 
come on , fellows 
he led the way , the others following 
as they approached the big ,  deserted barn frank black exclaimed in a whisper  i see a light 
do i 
added will evans 
it s moving around , spoke charley mason 
it s them , all right , decided bert 
the tramps who took our ice  cream are in there , all right 
what makes you think they are tramps 
asked will 
well , i am not sure , of course , admitted bert 
we can soon tell 
come on 
are you  are you going up there 
sked charley 
sure 
why not 
i think we can scare em away 
the other boys hesitated 
me of them were older than bert , and when  they saw that he was determined to go on , they made up their minds that  they would not let him go alone 
all right  go  ead  we are with you , said charley 
bert and the others advanced 
as they walked on they could see the  light in the barn more plainly 
as they stpped for a moment they  could hear voices talking in low tones 
more than one , whispered charley 
yes , three or four , said bert 
they walked  ead again , when suddenly charley stpped on a stck that  broke with a loud snap 
in an instnt the light in the barn went out ,  and then could be heard the footstps of several persons running away 
there they are 
shouted bert , dashing forward 
come on , fellows 
we will get  em now 
that s right 
cried charley 
come on , surround  em 
of course this was all said for effect , as the boys had no idea of  trying to capture the tramps , or whoever it was that had taken the ice  cream 
bert thought that they could scare the thieves away , for the  latter could not tell , in the darkness , how many , nor who were after  them 
flashing his light , bert dashed  ead , followed by the others 
into the  big barn they went , and , justas they entered the main part , they had a  glimpse of someone running out of a side door 
there they go 
cried charley 
we can catch  em 
no , let  em go , advised bert 
here s our ice cream 
let s see if  there s any left 
if there is we will take it back to the party 
we  might get into trouble if we went after those fellows 
by the gleam of the electric light they could all see the freezer of  cream in the middle of the barn floor , near some upturned boxes 
a  hast look showed that only a little had been taken out 
there s plenty left 
we surprised  em justin time 
now  let s get beck to the house 
it was rather a triumphant procession that went back to the home of the  bobbsey twins , carrying the recovered ice cream freezer 
such a  shout of delight from flossie , freddie and the others as greeted the  boys 
is there any left 
asked freddie 
plenty , said bert 
did you catch the bad tramps 
flossie wanted to know 
they got away , her brother said 
never mind , we scared them  before they had a chance to eat much 
i  clar t  goodness sakes alive 
gasped din  , when she saw the ice  cream freezer carried into her kitchen , yo  am suttinly a smart boy ,  massa bert  dat s what yo  su  am 
oh , well , the others helped me find it , said bert , modesty 
as din  and mr 
bobbsey were dishing out the cream , the colored cook  uttered a cry 
look out 
she exclaimed 
dere s suffin black in dere , mr 
bobbsey 
maybe it s a stne dem careless tramps put in 
wait  till i gits it  out 
with a longhandled spoon din  fished for the black thing , and got it 
she put it in a dish , with a small portion of the ice cream , and when  the latter had melted , bert , who was inspecting the object , gave a cry  of surprise 
why , it s a button    a coat button 
he exclaimed 
a button 
how in the world could that get in there 
asked his mother 
unless you boys drpped it in when you were carrying the cream 
bert and the other boys quickly looked at their coats 
there were no  buttons missing 
an  it su  wasn t in when de cream come he  , said din  
i knows ,  fo i took off de kiver an  looked in t  see how hard it were froze 
dat  button got in since 
yes , and i think i know how , too 
exclaimed bert 
how 
asked freddie 
it was drpped in by whoever took the freezer 
they musthave been  eating the cream right out of the can , and maybe they drpped the button  in 
i will save it 
what for 
asked nan , wonderingly 
i may be able to find out by it , who took the freezer , went on bert 
i am going to look at the coats of all the fellows in school next week ,  and if i find one with the button like this missing , i will know what to  think 
be careful not to accuse anyone wrongly , cautioned his mother 
bert put the button carefully away , and the party guest were soon  eating their ice cream , and discussing the disappearance of the freezer  and the finding of it by the boys 
with the playing of more games ,  and the singing of songs , the affair came to a close , and goodnights  were said 
we have had a lovely time 
glad you did  come again , invited the small  bobbsey twins 
even snap seemed to have enjoyed himself 
when the house was settling down to quietness for the night , and  when din  and mr 
bobbsey were picking up the dishes , the circus dog  marched around like a soldier , with a stck for a gun , and one of the  fancy caps , that came in the surprise packets , on his head 
when bert went to bed that night he laid the button found in the ice  cream where he would be sure to see it in the morning 
i am going to find out whose coat that came off of , he said to himself 
the little bobbsey twins slept late the next morning , and so did nan ,  but bert was up early 
i am going over to the barn , and see if i can tell by looking around it ,  how many were at our freezer , he said 
there was nothing there to help him in his search 
me old boxes ,  placed in a sort of circle , showed where the ones who had taken the ice  cream , had restd to eat it 
they musthave had spoons with them , said bert to himself , as he  looked about , that shows they came all prepared to take our ice cream 
they musthave known it was going to be here 
well , i will see whose  coat has a button missing 
it took bert some days to look carefully at the coats of the various  boys in school , who might have been guilty of taking the cream 
for a  time he had no luck , and then , one afternoon , as he noticed danny rugg  wearing a coat he seldom had on , bert walked slowly up to him , clasping  the button , with his hand , in his pocket 
his heart beat fastas he noticed that from the middle of danny s coat a  button was gone 
a glance at the others showed bert that they were justlike the one  found in the ice cream freezer 
i see you have losta button , danny , said bert , slowly 
hey 
exclaimed the bully , with a strt 
i see you have losta button , repeated bert 
yes , i guess it drpped off 
maybe it s home somewhere , said danny 
no , it isn t  it s here 
exclaimed bert , suddenly holding the button  out to him 
chapter xv thanksgiving for a moment danny rugg juststred at bert 
the bully swallowed a  sort of lump that came in his throat , and said  that isn t my button 
isn t it 
asked bert , politely 
why , it justmatches the others on  your coat , and it s got a few threads in the holes , and there are some  threads in your coat , justwhere the button was pulled off 
i guess  it s your button , all right , danny 
danny did not say anything 
he looked from the button to bert , and then  at the space on his coat where a button should have been , but where one  was missing 
well  well , he stmmered 
maybe it is off my coat , but  but how  did you get it , bert bobbsey 
i found it , was the answer 
do not you want it back 
he held it out to danny , who took it slowly 
well , went on bert , with a queer little smile at his enemy , why do not  you ask me where i found it , danny7 huh 
i do not care where you found it 
i s pose you picked it up  around the school yard , where i lostit , playing tag with the fellows 
no , you did not lose it there , went on bert , stll smiling 
you have  another guess coming , danny 
pooh 
i do not care where you found it , and danny was about to turn  away 
wait a minute , said bert 
suppose i say that this button was found  in our freezer of ice cream , that you and some other boys took off our  stop the night of flossie s and freddie s party , danny 
what about  that 
it isn t  i did not  you can t prove anything about me , bert bobbsey ,  and if you go around telling that i took your ice cream , i  but danny did not know what else to say 
he was confused and his face  was white and red by turns , for he realized that bert had good proof of  what he said 
better go slow , advised bert , calmly 
i do not intend to go around  telling what you did 
i justwant to let you know that i am sure you  took our ice cream 
i  i began danny 
you are only trying to fool me 
he exclaimed 
that button wasn t in it at all 
wasn t it 
asked bert , quietly 
well , you justask charley mason , or  any of the fellows who were at the party , what we found in the freezer ,  and see what they say 
danny had nothing to reply to this 
thrustng the button in his pocket  he walked off 
bert was sure he had found the boy who had taken the ice  cream 
later , from a boy who had been friends with danny for some time , but  whose father , afterward , decided that his son was getting into bad  company , and made him cease playing with the school bully , bert learned  that danny had planned to take the ice cream freezer off the porch 
he and several boys did this , carrying it to the old barn 
they had  provided themselves with large spoons , and were having a good time ,  eating the cream , when they heard the approach of bert and his friends ,  and fled , leaving the cream behind 
it was during a dispute as to who should have the right to firstdip  into the freezer that danny and a boy named jake harkness had a  stuggle , and in this danny losta button which fell into the ice cream  without anyone knowing it 
the coat danny wore that night he did not  put on again for some time , but when he did bert saw the missing button 
danny knew that he had been found out , and for a time he had little to  say 
bert was boy enough not to be able to keep altogether quiet  over his discovery 
from time to time he would ask danny  lostany more buttons , lately 
you let me alone 
danny would reply , surlily 
of course this made talk , the boys wanting to know what it meant , and at  lastthe stry came out 
this made danny so angry that he picked  several quarrels with bert 
on his part bert tried to avoid them , but  at lasthe could stnd it no longer , and he and danny came to blows  again , danny stiking first bert had been brought up with the idea that fighting , unless it could  absolutely be avoided , was not gentlemanly , but in this case he could  not get out of it 
he and danny went at each other with their fist clenched , a crowd of  other boys looking on , and urging one or the other to do their best for  both danny and bert had friends , though bert was the bestliked 
danny stuck bert several times , and bert hit back , once hitting danny  in the eye 
bert s lip was cut , and when the fight was over both boys  did not look very nice 
everyone said bert had the bestof it 
oh , bert 
exclaimed his mother , when he came home after the trouble  with danny 
you have been fighting 
yes , mother , i have , he admitted 
i am sorry , but i couldn t help it 
danny rugg hit me first  i couldn t run away , could i 
it was a hard queston for a mother to answer 
no mother likes to think  her son a coward , and that was what the boys would have called bert had  he not stod up to danny 
i  i justhad to 
continued bert 
i beat him , anyhow , mother 
mr 
bobbsey cried a little , and then she made the bestof it , and  bathed bert s cut lip and bruised forehead 
she told his father about  it , too , and mr bobbsey , after hearing the account , asked  who won 
well , bert says he did 
um 
well , i have no doubt but what he did 
he is getting quite stong 
oh , richard 
exclaimed mr 
bobbsey , in dismay 
well , boys will er  have their little troubles , said her husband 
i am sorry bert had to fight , but i am glad he wasn t a coward 
he  must t fight any more 
mr bobbsey sat down to read the evening paper 
the weather was getting cooler 
several nights there had been heavy  frost , and for some time the papers had been saying that it was going  to snow , but the white flakes did not sift down from the sky 
thanksgiving was approaching 
it was the end of the fall term of  school , and there were to be examinations to see who would pass into the  next higher classes for the winter season 
of course in the case of freddie and flossie , who were stll in the  kindergarten , the examinations were not very hard , but they were soon to  go into the regular primary class , where they would learn to read 
both the twins were very anxious for this 
bert and nan had somewhat  harder lessons to do , and they had to answer more difficult questons in  the examinations 
i am glad to say that all of the bobbsey twins were promoted , and  freddie and flossie came home very proud to tell that when they went  back again , after the thanksgiving holidays , they would be in the primer  reading book 
such preparations as went on for thanksgiving 
din  was busy from  morning until night , and when the little twins made inquiries about the  turkey they were to have mr bobbsey said it would be the biggesthe  could buy 
an  i se gwine t  stff him wif chestuts an  oystrs , said din  
i  tells you what , chilluns , yo  all am suttinly gwine to hab one grand  feed 
i wish everybody was , said flossie , a bit wistully 
i hope our cat  snoop , wherever he is , has plenty of milk , and some nice turkey bones 
i guess he will have , said mamma bobbsey , gently 
i hope all the poor childrn in our school have enough to eat , said  freddie 
mr tetlow said for us to bring what we could for them 
you never told me 
exclaimed mr 
bobbsey 
why did not you 
i  would have sent something 
neither bert nor nan had thought to mention at home that a collection  would be taken at the school for the poor families in the town 
as  soon as mr 
bobbsey heard what freddie said she telephoned to her  husband 
mr bobbsey went to see mr tetiow , and from him learned that  there were a number of families who would not have a very happy  thanksgiving 
the lumber merchant gave certain orders to his grocer and butcher ,  and if a number of poor people were not well supplied with food that  gladsome season , it was not the fault of mr bobbsey 
i am getting a little  ead of my stry 
a few days before thanksgiving mr 
bobbsey , with a letter in her hand ,  came to where the four twins were in the sitting room , talking over what  they wanted for christas 
guess who are coming to spend thanksgiving with us 
cried mamma  bobbsey , as she waved the letter in the air 
uncle bobbsey 
guessed nan 
uncle minturn , said bert 
the little twins guessed other friends and relatives , and finally mr 
bobbsey said  yes , your uncle bobbsey and uncle minturn are coming , and so are your  aunts , and cousin harry , cousin dorothy and also hal bingham , whom you  met at the seashore 
oh , what a jolly thanksgiving it will be 
cried the bobbsey twins 
chapier xvi mr tetlow asks questons thanksgiving was celebrated in the bobbsey home as it never had been  before 
i am afraid if i told you all that went on , of the big ,  brownroastd turkey , of the piles of crisp turkey , of the pumpkin and  mince pies , of the nuts and candies , of the big dishes of cranberry  sauce , and the plum pudding that din  carried in high above her head   i am afraid if i told you of all these things there would be trouble 
for i am sure you would all be writing to me to ask where the bobbseys  lived , so that you might go and see them , and perhaps spend christas  with them 
not that they would not be glad to have you , but they have  so many friends that their house is sure to be filled over the holidays 
i will simply say that there was the grandesttime ever , and let it  go at that 
uncle and aunt bobbsey  uncle and aunt minturn , from the country and  seashore , came , with cousin dorothy and cousin harry then , also , hal  bingham arrived , and the bobbsey twins took great delight in showing  their former playmates about lakeport 
isn t it lonesome at the seashore now 
asked nan of dorothy , as she  walked with her cousin about the busy steets of the town 
not at all , answered dorothy 
the sea is never lonesome for me 
it  always seems to be telling me something , winter or summer 
i love it in the summer , said nan , but in the winter it seems so cold  and cruel 
that is because you do not know it as well as i do , said dorothy 
hal , harry , and bert had fine times together 
there was no skating , and  the little flurry of snow there had been was not enough for coastng ,  but they had other fun 
do your ducks miss our duck downy 
asked freddie of his cousin harry 
well , i guess they do , was the laughing answer , for freddie and  flossie had a pet duck which they took about with them almostas  faithfully as they did snoop 
how is downy , anyhow 
asked harry 
he is fine , answered the little fellow 
want to see him 
he took  his cousin out to the barn where downy had a pen all to himself 
snoop s gone , said freddie , and so is our silver cup , but maybe we will  get that back 
it s in a circus 
in a circus 
cried harry 
i should think your cat might be in a  circus , but not a silver cup 
we do not know where snoop is , went on freddie ,  cause he got away at  the time of the circus wreck , and he explained about it 
we are  almostsure the circus fat lady has our cup 
the thanksgiving holidays came to an end at lastand , much to the regret  of the bobbseys , their visitors , old and young , had to go back to their  homes 
you will come again at christas , won t you 
asked flossie as she  said goodbye 
we will try , said her uncle bobbsey 
maybe there won t be room ,  with santa claus and all his reindeers 
oh , we will make room for you , spoke freddie 
santa claus won t sty  long 
with a merry peal of laughter the visitors went off to the sttion ,  waving farewells 
came rather a quiet time at the bobbsey house ,  as there always is when visitors go 
there seems to be a sort of  loneliness , when company leaves , no matter how many there are in the  family , nor what fun there is 
the feeling soon passes 
well , we will soon be at school again , said bert , a day or so before the  opening of the winter term 
i wish we would get some snow 
it would  be more fun 
yes , said freddie 
we could build snow forts and have snowball  fights 
i wish it would snow hard 
do i , so we could ride down hill , said nan 
is your big bob  nearly done , bert 
no , charley and i have quite a lot of things to do on it yet , but we are  going to work every night after school now , and it will soon be  finished 
i am going to have skates for christas , announced freddie 
i hope  the lake will be frozen over by then 
i guess it will be , returned bert 
it s getting colder every night 
the bobbseys were back at school 
for a time nan and bert , who were in  a higher grade , did not like it so well , as they had a stange teacher ,  and lessons , too , were more difficult 
they were not childrn who  gave up easily , and soon they were at the head of their class as usual 
their teacher , too , was much nicer than they had thought at first  they  had considered her strn , but it was only her way , and soon wore off 
as for freddie and flossie , they had advanced but little except in  reading , and this opened a new world to them 
we will soon be reading books , boastd freddie , on his way home one day 
i am going to read all about firemen , soldiers and indians 
oh , i am not , said flossie 
i am going to read how to be a nurse , so i  can take care of you when you are hurt 
that will be nice , said freddie 
one day , at recess , bert saw jim osborne motioning to him in a secret  sort of fashion 
come on with us , said jim , who was a new boy in school 
danny rugg  and some of the restof us are going to have some sport 
what doing 
asked bert 
smoking cigarettes back of the coal house 
i have got a whole pack 
no 
i do not smoke , said bert quietly 
b  
you are afraid 
sneered jim 
cigarettes can t hurt you 
it s only cigars and pipes that do 
yes , i admit i am afraid , said bert 
i am afraid of getting sick 
besides , i promised my mother i wouldn t smoke until i was twentyone ,  and i am not going to tell a stry 
anyhow , i have got an uncle who  smokes , and he says cigarettes are worse than a pipe or cigars , and he  ought to know 
aw , come on 
urged jim 
no , said bert firmly , and he would not go 
jim went off with danny  and some of the other boys , and they were laughing among themselves 
bert felt that they were laughing at him , but he did not mind 
there was to be an examination of the school by some of the members of  the board of education late that afternoon , and , directly after recess ,  mr tetlow went to each room to tell the pupils and teachers to get  ready for it , and to put certain work on the blackboards , so it could be  seen 
when the principal got to the room where danny rugg and his particular  chums sat , mrtetlow , sniffing the air suspiciously , said  i smell smoke 
i have been noticing it , too , said the lady teacher 
perhaps the  furnace does not work properly 
it isn t that kind of smoke , went on mr tetlow 
it is tobacco  smoke 
have any of you boys been smoking during recess 
he asked  strnly , looking across the room 
no one answered 
danny , jim , and some of the others seemed to be  stdying their geography lessons very hard 
i justwant to say a word about cigarette smoking , went on mr tetlow ,  for that is usually how a boy begins 
of smoking in general , when a  boy gets to be a man , i have nothing to say 
me say it is injurious ,  and others not , in moderation 
there can be no doubt that for a  growing boy to smoke is very harmful 
again i ask if anyone here has  been smoking 
no one replied 
the guilty boys bent deep over their books and did not  look up 
well , i am sure someone here has , said mr tetlow 
i can smell it  plainly 
he walked down the aisles , looking sharply from one boy to  another 
if he was sure who were the guilty ones he gave no sign 
i want to add , said mr tetlow , that not only is cigarette smoking  harmful to the smoker , but it is dangerous 
many fires have been caused  in that way 
if i find out who of my pupils have been smoking around  the school they will be severely punished 
chapter xvii the firstsnow there was considerable talk among the boys in danny s room after mr  tetlow departed 
it was noticed that danny and some of his  particular friends looked around with rather frightened faces , over  their shoulders , as they talked among themselves 
what they said could  not be heard , for they spoke in whispers 
i hope you weren t one of those boys , bert , said nan , as she passed  her brother on the way home from school that afternoon 
if you were  you needn t worry , he said , with a smile 
i am not ready to smoke  yet 
nor ever , i hope , said nan , as she turned up her little nose 
it   it smells so 
nothing more was heard of the smoking matter for several days , and it  was about forgotten , when something else came to claim the attention of  the bobbsey twins and their friends 
it was toward the close of school one afternoon , when all the pupils  were wishing the hands of the clock would point to lettingout time ,  that nan , looking from the window , and away from her arithmetic book ,  saw a few white flakes of snow sifting lazily down 
at once she was all  attention , and her lesson was forgotten 
oh 
she thought , it s snowing 
it looks as if it would be a big  strm 
oh , i am so glad 
nan did not know all the trouble and misery a big snow strm can cause ,  so she may be forgiven for wishing for one 
she only saw the side of it  that meant fun for her and her friends 
the flakes were coming down fastr now , and there was about them  something which seemed to tell that this strm would be more than a mere  flurry or squall , and that it would keep up for some time , making big  drfts 
now a number of other pupils in the room had noticed the strm , and  eyes were out of doors rather than on books 
the teacher saw that she  was not getting the attention of her class , and she understod the  reason 
now , boys and girls , she said gently , you can have a good time in the  snow after you get out of here 
please give attention to your  lessons for a few minutes more 
you will be finished 
nan  bobbsey , you may go to the board and do the third example 
nan was thinking so much of the fun she might have riding down hill ,  or snowballing with her friends , that she got the example wrong , and had  to go to her seat 
nor was bert any more successful 
bert was busy thinking about putting a bell and a stering wheel on the  new bob he and charley had made , and when he was asked how many times  two and a half went into ten he answered   three 
he was thinking how  many times he would ring the bell on the bob when he came to a steet  crossing 
when the bobbsey twins , little and big , came out of school the snow was  coming down more thickly 
the flakes were not so large , but there were  more of them , and they blew here and there in the wind , drfting into  piles that would make the shoveling off of walks hard the next day 
there were justabout enough of the white crystls on the ground , when  the school childrn came out to make a few snowballs , and this they at  once proceeded to do 
danny rugg , who had not forgiven bert for the many times the bobbsey lad  had gotten the bestof him , threw a ball at freddie 
bert was on  the watch , and managed to jump up and catch the white missile in his  hand 
he threw it at danny , stiking him on the neck 
here 
where you throwin  
demanded danny , in angry tones 
the same place you are , replied bert , not a bit afraid 
good weather  for ice cream , danny , he added , and danny went off in an angry fashion 
other boys and girls too , threw the snowballs , but it was in goodnatured  fun , and no one was hurt 
me rough boys did use hard snowballs , but  they were soon left to play among themselves , while the others amused  themselves with soft and fluffy missiles , which , breaking as they hit ,  scattered the white stff all over , harming no one 
the girls , while they played at this sport , also indulged in washing the  faces of each other 
with handsful of snow they rubbed the ears and  cheeks of their chums so that there came a healthy glow to the skin 
one or two childrn , who lived near the school , ran in their yards as  soon as the classes were dismissed , and brought out their sleds 
the snow was too thin to pack well and at bestthe coastng was not  good 
it soon will be , declared bert , as he and charley walked along 
we mustfinish our bob in a hurry 
all right 
we will work on it late tonight 
so the sound of hammer , plane and saw was heard in the old barn ,  where the sled was being built , until nearly ten o clock 
she ought to go very fast exclaimed charley , as they paused to look  at their sled 
i am sure she will , agreed bert 
we will put some carpet on the top  of the main board , for a cushion for some of the girls 
his chum  agreed that this would be a good plan , and so the bob was made very  attractive for the girls 
bert and charley took the big sled out for a private trial on a little  hill behind the barn without telling anyone about it 
they slid down  very swiftly , and as they were walking up again bert said  i think we have a fastone all right , charley 
i am sure we have , was the answer 
it will pass anything on the main hill , went on bert , and his friend  believed him 
the strm kept up all night , and in the morning there was snow enough to  suit anyone 
bert laughed as he looked out of the window and saw it 
there will be coastng now all right 
he cried , as he saw the big  stetch of white over the fields and on the hills 
we can have bob  sled races , too 
can t we come 
asked flossie 
we like sled rides , added freddie 
you may come part of the time , answered bert 
big sleds aren t  for little folks like you 
not far from the bobbsey home was a long hill that was mostexcellent  for coastng 
it was on this that charley and bert had decided to test their new sled on a long stetch 
as they hauled it from the barn where it had been made , and strted to  pull it to the hill , there were many laughs at the odd homemade affair 
for bert and charley had done mostof the work themselves , and it was  rather rough 
she will never coast cried one boy , with a laugh 
he was quite a  friend of danny s 
here comes the sled that can , though 
cried another , and danny himself  came into view , pulling a fine , new , big bob after him 
that s the faststone on the hill , boastd another lad who was  helping danny pull his sled 
well , i think ours is fast too , said bert calmly 
do you want to race 
asked danny with a sharp glance at bert 
i do not mind , was the answer 
it was after school , following the  firstsnow , and the hill was justright for coastng 
come on 
come on 
cried a number of boys and girls , as they heard  what went on between danny and bert 
there s going to be a race on the  big hill between the big bobs 
there was much excitement 
the sleds were the two largestowned by  anyone in the neighborhood , and both were fine ones 
danny had bought  his , but bert and charley had made theirs , and so , though it was not so  fancy , it was stonger 
mosteyes were on danny s sled , for it was  painted in bright colors , and brightly varnished 
it had a red cushion  of carpet on the top , and places at the side to restone s feet 
the bob of bert and charley was built justthe same , but it was painted  in homemade fashion , and the carpet seat was an old and faded one 
it had a new gong and a fine big stering wheel 
all ready for the race , cried danny , as he got his sled in position 
who s going down with me 
a number of boys came forward 
who s going with bert and me 
asked charley , and several others  stpped forward 
go  ead , if you want to come in last sneered danny , as he got his  sled in place 
i will tell  em you are coming , bert 
all right , was the cool answer 
get an , boys 
on both sleds were filled , and all was ready for the big race    the  firstof the season 
chapter xviii a night alarm are you all ready 
called danny to bert , looking over at the homemade  bob , and there was something like contempt in his tone 
all ready , answered bert 
i will strt as soon as you give the word 
we ought to have someone to shove us off , suggestd danny 
it won t  be fair if one or the other gets a headstrt 
hi 
he is afraid already 
cried charley mason 
he knows we are going  to beat 
i am not 
retorted danny 
it will be a walkover for me once i strt 
i do not want bert bobbsey saying i took advantage of him , after the  race is over 
you needn t be afraid  i won t say so  i won t have to , replied  bert 
all the same i think it would be better if we each had a push 
i want to be fair , too 
hey , bert 
called a shrill voice , as the elder bobbsey lad was looking  about for some on the hill to whom he might appeal 
can t i ride down  with you , bert 
it was freddie who called , and he came runnining up , anxious to take  part in the exciting race 
no , freddie , not this time , explained bert kindly 
i want only large  boys with me in the race 
i will give you a ride afterward 
after i beat him , he means , sneered danny 
come on , let s race if we are going to , called some of the boys on  danny s sled 
yes 
do not sty here all day 
get a move on 
we will beat , anyhow , what s the use of racing 
there were only a few of things that those on the big new sled of  danny s , called to those on bert s bob 
on their part bert s friends  voiced such remarks as  we are not so stong on looks , but we will get there first we are going to give danny a tow to the bottom of the hill 
he won t know he is moving , once bert s sled gets strted going 
well , what are we going to do 
asked danny at last  shall we shove  off ourselves 
justthen there came along two large boys , frank cobb , and his  particular chum , irving knight 
what s going on here 
a race 
asked frank 
it looks that way , said irving 
oh , will you push us off 
begged bert , appealing to frank , whose  father worked in mr bobbsey s lumber yard 
sure we will , answered frank goodnaturedly 
take the other sled ,  irving , he said to his chum , and we will give  em an even strt 
we will see which beats , and may the bestsled win 
that s what i say 
cried irving 
the two larger boys took their places behind the bobs 
they slowly  shoved them to the edge of the hill , held them there a moment , and , at a  nod to each other , shoved them down evenly 
hurray 
cried the crowd of other coastrs 
there they go 
danny s  ead 
no , bert s sled is 
shouted his admirers 
as a matter of fact , though , both sleds were even at the strt 
on and  on they went very swiftly , for the hill had been worn smooth 
bert  saw his bob getting  ead a little , and he felt that he was going to win  easily 
he was glad too soon , for , a little later , danny s sled shot  ead ,  and for some distnce was in the lead 
can t you beat him , bert 
whispered charley mason , who sat justbehind  his chum 
i hope so , was the answer 
i can t really do anything 
we just have to depend on the sled , you know 
ster a little more over to the left , suggestd another boy 
it  looks smoother there 
i will , said bert , and he turned the stertng wheel of his bob while  luke morton , in the rear , pulled hard on the bell , making it clang out a  loud warning 
look out where you are going , bert bobbsey 
warned danny , looking back 
you are coming over on my side of the hill 
no i am not 
i am away from the middle even , said bert 
besides , i am  behind you 
i know you are , and you are going to sty there 
i do not want you to  run into me 
bert thought of the time , the winter before , when danny had run into  him , and broken his sled , but he said nothing 
he did not want that  kind of an accident to be repeated if he could help it 
on , on and on dashed the big bobs , with the crowd on the hill , and a  number of coastrs scattered along the way , watching anxiously 
as soon  as bert had stered over to the left his sled began to go fastr , as the  snow was packed better there 
he was fastcatching up to danny , when  one of the boys on that bob , looking back , saw it , and warned the  stersman 
he is coming , danny , he cried 
oh , he is 
eh 
well , he won t pass me , and danny stered his sled  over directly in front of bert s , almostcausing bert to collide vith  him 
shame 
cried some watchers 
that wasn t fair 
let him keep on his own side then , warned danny 
this mean trick did danny little good for , though bert was forced to  go to the right , to avoid crashing into danny , he , mostunexpectedly ,  found good coastng there , and he shot  ead until his sled was even  with that of the bully s 
better look out , danny , warned the boy sitting directly back of him 
he is crowding us fast oh , it s only a spurt 
we will soon be at the bottom of the hill and  win 
on and on came bert s bob , the flier 
it was a little  ead of danny s  now , and the latter , seeing this , stered over , thinking the going was  better there 
look out 
warned bert 
who s crowding over now 
well , i have got a right here 
snarled danny 
bert knew his rights also , and would not give away 
he held to his  place , and danny dared not come too close 
as bert found himself  on smooth , hardpacked snow , he stered as staight as he could 
more  and more  ead of danny he went , until he was fully in front of him 
we are going to win 
we are going to win 
cried bert s friends 
we are  going to win the race 
danny was wild with anger 
he stered his sled over sharply , hoping to  get on the same track as was bert and so pass him 
it was not to  be 
danny took too sudden a turn , and the next instnt his bob  overturned , spilling everyone off 
there was a cry of surprise at the accident , and some of those on bert s  sled looked back 
bert himself looked staight  ead as a stersman  always should 
danny s upset 
cried charley 
i am sorry 
now he will claim the race wasn t fair 
that is what danny did when he picked himself up , and walked down to  meet bert , whose bob got safely to the foot of the hill , and so won the  race 
aw , i would have beaten if you hadn t gotten in my way so i had to ster  over , cried danny 
do not talk that way now , said irving , who , with frank cobb had come to  the end of the hill 
bert beat you fair and square 
aw , well grumbled danny 
i will race over again , if you like , offered bert 
yes , and do the same thing , grumbled danny 
i will not 
i know my  sled is the best but few others , save those who hoped for a ride on it , agreed with the  bully , and bert s homemade bob was held to be champion of the hill 
came many more coast , bert giving nan and flossie and freddie , and  a number of their little girl and boy friends , several rides 
until late that evening the coastng kept up , and bert and charley were  congratulated on all sides for the fine bob they had made 
what fun  bert had home after supper , telling of how he had won the race 
it was in the middle of the night , when the bobbsey household was  awakened by the ringing of fire bells 
they all heard the alarm , and as  papa bobbsey counted the number , he said to his wife  that mustbe near here 
guess i will look 
it s a windy night and a  fire in my lumber yard would be very bad 
as he went to the window he saw a glare on the sky in the direction of  the lake 
it is near here 
he said 
the engines are going pastour house 
i would  better take a look 
can i come 
asked the little fat fireman from his cot 
take me ,  papa 
chapter xix who was smoking 
mr bobbsey laughed , though he was worried about the fire 
it seemed so  odd for freddie to want to go out in the cold , dark night 
not this time , my fat fireman 
it may be only a  pile of rubbish on fire 
i will tell you about it when i come back 
where does it seem to be 
asked mr 
bobbsey 
down near the lake , answered her husband 
i am afraid , he added in a  lower voice , that it may be our boathouse 
it seems to be about  there 
oh , i hope not 
she exclaimed 
stll , better that than our own  house 
if it s near the lake , papa , said flossie who heard part of what her  father said , it will be easy to put it out , for there is plenty of  water 
pooh 
engines have their own water 
exclaimed freddie , who had rather  hazy notions as to how fire engines work 
he was getting over his  disappointment about not being allowed to go with his father , and had  again cuddled down in his warm crib 
another engine dashed by the bobbsey house , and the ringing of the alarm  bell increased 
the voices and footstps of many persons , as they  rushed on to the blaze , could also be heard , and there resounded the cry  of  fire 
fire 
fire 
bert , who had been aroused with the others of the household , was  drssing in his room 
he felt that his father would let him go to the  fire 
at any rate he intended to be all ready when he made his request  so as not to cause delay 
are you going , bert 
asked nan , as from her room , next to that of her  brother , she heard him moving around 
i am , if father will take me , he said 
it s too cold for me 
nan exclaimed with a shiver , as she went back in  bed again 
she had gotten up to peer from the window at the red glare  in the sky 
from the third floor , where din  slept , the colored cook now called  down  am anybody sick , mr 
bobbsey 
what am de matt  down dere 
it s a fire , din  
answered her mistess 
oh good land a massy 
do not tell me dat 
she cried 
sam  
sam 
wake  up 
de house is on fire an  you se got t  sabe me 
no , no , din  
cried mr 
bobbsey , to calm the cook 
it isn t this  house 
it s down by the lake 
if you look out of your window you can  see it 
din  hurried across to her window , and evidently saw the reflection of  the blaze , for she exclaimed  thank goodness it ain t ye  
m  goodness , but i su  was skarit fo   a minute 
by this time mr bobbsey had drssed , and had strted downstirs 
bert  came out of his room , also ready for the steet 
may i come , father 
he asked 
well , i declare 
exclaimed mr bobbsey , in surprise 
you got  drssed too , did you 
yes , sir 
may i come 
mr bobbsey hesitated a moment , and then , with a smile , said  well , i suppose so , since you are all ready 
i am taking bert , he  called to his wife 
freddie , you will have to be the fat fireman while  i am gone , and look after the house 
that s what i will , said freddie , and if any sparks fly over here  i will throw the bath room sponge on  em 
good 
cried mr bobbsey , and then , he and bert hurried out 
the fire was now larger , as they could see when they got out in the  steet 
there was no wind and the flames went staight up in the air 
there were not many buildings down by the lake , only some boat shelters  and places like that 
the bobbsey s boathouse was a fine large one ,  having recently been made bigger as mr bobbsey was thinking of buying a  new motor boat 
mr bobbsey and his son hurried on , following the crowd that filled the  steet leading to the lake 
several gentlemen knew the lumber merchant ,  and called to him 
i guess you are glad this isn t your lumber yard , said one 
yes , indeed , was the answer 
i had a little fire there once , and i  do not want another 
i am afraid this is some of my property justthe  same 
is that so 
yes , it looks to be my boathouse 
it does 
cried another man 
oh , father 
cried bert 
our nice boathouse 
well , the firemen may save it , said mr bobbsey 
we will hope so ,  anyhow , he added 
they had not gone on much farther before mr bobbsey and bert could see  that it was indeed their boathouse on fire 
one side was all ablaze ,  and the flames were slowly , but surely , eating their way over the whole  place 
two engines were now pumping steams of water on the fire ,  and they might put it out before too much damage was done 
mr bobbsey rushed forward , and , as the policemen and firemen knew him ,  they let him get close to the boathouse 
you sty here , bert , said mr bobbsey to his son 
where are you going 
bert wanted to know 
i am going to see if we can save any of the boats 
there was a sailing craft , a number of rowboats , and a small gasoline  launch in the boathouse 
they had been stred away for the winter 
come on , men 
cried mr bobbsey , as he saw some of his workmen in the  crowd 
help me save the boats 
all rushed forward willingly , and , as there was part of the place where  the flames had not yet reached , they could make their way into the  house 
they began lowering the boats into the icy water , while the  firemen played the several lines of hose on the flames 
the third engine was now working , and so much water was pumped that even  a larger fire could not have stod it for very long 
the blaze began to  die down , and when mr bobbsey and his men were about to lower the  gasoline launch into the icy water the chief ran up , saying  you do not need to do that 
we have got the fire under control now 
it  will soon be out 
are you sure 
asked the lumber merchant 
yes 
you can see for yourself 
leave the boat there 
it will be all  right 
mr bobbsey looked , and was satisfied that the larger part of the  boathouse would be saved 
he and his men stpped their work 
went outside to cool off 
a little later the fire was practically out , but one engine continued to  throw water on the smouldering sparks 
the crowd began to leave now ,  for there was nothing more to see , and it was cold 
my 
exclaimed bert as his father came back to where he had left his  son , it did not take long to settle that fire 
no , we have a good fire department , replied mr bobbsey 
the fire chief came up to mrbobbsey , who expressed his thanks for the  quick work of the firemen 
have you any idea what strted the fire , mr bobbsey 
asked the chief 
was the boathouse in use 
no , was the answer 
it had been closed for the winter some time ago   in fact as soon as the carpenters finished making the changes 
no one  was in it as far as i know 
how do you account for this 
asked the chief , as he held out a  box partly filled with cigarettes 
i picked these up in the living  room , he went on , for the boathouse had one room carpeted , and fitted  with chairs and tables , and electric lights where the family often spent  evenings during summer 
you found those cigarettes in the living room of the boathouse 
asked  mr bobbsey 
i did 
the queston is who was smoking 
went on the chief 
in my  opinion the end of a cigarette thrown aside , or perhaps a lighted match  drpped in some corner , strted this fire 
who was smoking 
a confession the chief handed mr bobbsey the halfemptied cigarette box 
mr  bobbsey turned it over and over in his hand , as though trying to learn  to whom it belonged 
they are something i never use , he said 
i do not suppose we could  tell , from this , who had it 
no , and the chief shook his head 
it s a common kind , and a good  many of the stres sell  em 
a good many of the boys smoke  em , too   that s the worstof it , and he looked at bert a bit sharply 
oh , you needn t be afraid for my boy 
exclaimed mr bobbsey hastly 
i have bert s promise that he won t smoke until he is man , and perhaps  he won t want to then 
good 
exclaimed the chief heartily 
that s what i like to hear 
it s as certain as guns is , and nothing more certain than them , that  some one was smoking in your boathouse , and set fire to it 
i wish  we could find out who it was 
do i 
exclaimed mr bobbsey 
if only to teach them a lesson on  how dangerous it is to be careless 
well , i suppose we can t do  anything more , and he sighed , for half the beautiful boathouse was in  ruins 
mr bobbsey and bert were soon at home , telling the news to the folks 
freddie s eyes opened wide in surprise as he listned to the account of  how the firemen had put out the fire 
oh , i wish i could have been there 
he cried 
i could have helped 
what caused the fire 
asked mr 
bobbsey of her husband , when the  childrn had gone to bed again 
me boys  or some one else smoking cigarettes , the chief thinks 
we  found a halfemptied box 
in her room nan heard the word cigarettes and she wondered if her  brother could be at fault , for she remembered he had told her how once  some boys had asked him to go off in secret and smoke 
mr bobbsey was up early , for he wanted to see by daylight what damage  the fire had done , and he also wanted to see the insurance company about  the loss 
the beautiful boathouse looked worse in the daylight than it  had at night , and the neat living room , where some of the bobbseys had  spent many happy hours , while others of them were out in the boats , was  in ruins 
the fire chief came down while mr bobbsey was there , and they talked  matters over 
the chief said he would send one of his men around to the  different stres that sold cigarettes , to try and learn if boys had  purchased any that afternoon , for it was againstthe law to sell  cigarettes to anyone under sixteen years of age 
one afternoon danny s father , mr rugg , came home unexpectedly , and ,  wanting something that was out in his barn went to get it 
as he  entered the place he heard a scramble of feet , some excited whispers ,  and then silence 
he was sure that some one was in the place and had  run to hide 
who s there 
called mr rugg sharply 
there was no answer , but he  listned and was sure he heard some one in the little room where the  harness was kept 
he walked over to the door , and tried to open it 
me one on the  inside was holding it , but mr rugg gave a stong pull , and the door  flew open 
to the surprise of mr rugg he saw his son danny , and a  number of boys , hiding there , and the smell of cigarette smoke was very  stong 
danny 
exclaimed his father strnly , what does this mean 
we  were  playing 
stmmered danny 
playing hide and seek 
to play that is it necessary to smoke 
mr rugg asked sharply 
we  we aren t smoking , answered danny 
not now , but you have been 
i can smell it plainly 
go into the  house , danny , and these other boys mustgo home 
if i find them smoking  in my barn again i shall punish them 
you might have set it on fire 
danny had nothing to say , indeed , there was little he could say 
he had  been caught in the act 
the other boys slunk off , and danny went into the house , his father  following 
danny , i am very sorry to learn this , said mr rugg 
i did not know  that you smoked  a boy of your age 
well , i never smoked much 
lots of the fellows smoke more than i do 
that is no excuse 
it is a bad habit for a boy 
you may go to your  room 
i will consider your case later 
from then on mr rugg did some hard thinking 
he began putting two and  two together as the old saying has it 
he remembered the bobbsey  boathouse fire 
on that occasion danny had come in late , and there had  been the smell of smoke on his clothes 
mr rugg went to his son s room 
a search showed a number of empty  cigarette boxes , and cigarette pictures , and the boxes were all of the  same kind  the kind that had been found in the halfburned boathouse 
danny was accused by his father of having been smoking in the boathouse  justbefore the fire , and danny was so miserable , and so surprised at  being caught in the barn , that he made a full confession 
tearfully he  told the stry , how he and some other boys , finding the boat house  unlocked , for some unknown reason , had gone in , and smoked to their  heart s content 
they did not mean to cause the fire , and had no idea that they were to  blame 
one of the boys was made ill by too much smoking , and they all  hurried away 
they musthave left a smouldering stmp of cigarette in some corner ,  or a carelessly thrown match , that strted the blaze 
when the  fire bells sounded , and they learned what had happened , danny and all  the boys promised each other that they would keep the secret 
well , danny , i can t tell you how sorry i am , said mr rugg , when the  confession was over 
rry not only that mr bobbsey s boathouse was  burned , but because you have deceived me , and your good mother , and  smoked in secret 
i feel very badly about it 
danny did , too , for though he was not a very good boy , his heart was in  the right place , and with a little more care he might have been a  different character 
there was , however , hope for him 
you mustbe punished for this , went on mr rugg , and this punishment  will be that you are not to have the motor boat i promised you for next  summer 
perhaps it will be a lesson to you 
danny wept bitterly , for he had counted very much on having this boat 
it was a good lesson to him 
mr rugg also told the fathers of the  other boys whom he caught with his son , and these boys were punished in  different ways 
mr rugg also informed mr bobbsey how the boathouse had been set afire ,  and expressed his sorrow 
so the mystry was cleared up 
the fat lady s letter well , remarked nan bobbsey , a few days after it had become known that  danny rugg was to blame for the fire in the boathouse , i wish we could  find out , as easily as we found out about danny , who has our cat snoop 
do i , added flossie 
poor snoop 
i do miss him so much 
do i 
exclaimed freddie 
snap is a nice dog , and i guess i  like dogs better than cats , anyhow 
why , freddie bobbsey 
cried nan 
do not you love snoop any more 
oh , yes ,  course i do , but then he isn t here to be loved , and snap  is 
yes , i guess that does make a difference , admitted nan 
i wonder if  papa wouldn t let us go down to the railroad office and inquire once  more about him 
maybe , as it s getting cold weather now , snoop will  come in from the fields where he may have been stying ever since the  railroad wreck 
let s ask , cried freddie , always ready for action 
it was saturday , and there was no school 
bert had gone off coastng on  his new bob , but nan did not want to go , her mother having asked her to  sty and help with the dustng 
now the little bit of housework was  over , and nan was free 
we will go down to papa s office , she said to flossie and freddie , and  ask him if we can go to the railroad 
i know one of the ticket agents  and he can tell us of whom to ask about our cat 
mr 
bobbsey had no objections , and soon , with f1ossie and freddie at  her side , nan set off for her father s office in the lumber yard 
the  smaller twins were delighted 
maybe we can find our silver cup , too , suggestd freddie , as they  trudged along in the snow , now and then stpping to make a white ball ,  which he threw at the fence or telegraph pole 
the fat lady has our cup  i am sure of that , said flossie 
well , we can ask papa if he has heard from the circus people ,   suggestd nan 
mr bobbsey was rather surprised to see his three childrn come into the  office , but he was glad to meet them , for it made a break in his day s  work 
after a little thought he said they might go to the railroad  office to inquire about snoop 
nan and her brother and sistr went in a  trolley car , and were soon at the depot 
to their disappointment there was no news of snoop 
the fat , black  cat seemed to have completely disappeared 
i have had the switchmen and trackmen keep a lookout for some time past  the agent told nan , for mr bobbsey did a large business in shipping  lumber over the railroad , and many of the men were his friends 
one of  the switchmen near where the wreck was , caught a lot of cats , that must have been living out in the fields all summer , went on the agent , but  they were all sorts of colors 
none was pure black , so i knew they could  not be yours 
i am sorry 
yes , so are we , replied nan 
well , i guess snoop is lostfor good 
he has been away a long time now 
on the way back to mr bobbsey s office , the trolley car got off the  track , on account of so much snow on the rails , and the childrn spent  some time watching the men get it back , the electricity from the wire  and rails making pretty flashes of blue fire 
what luck 
asked mr bobbsey , as the three came in his private office ,  their faces shining and red with the glow of winter 
none , said nan sadly 
snoop is gone 
have you heard from the circus fat lady yet , papa 
asked flossie 
yes , we want our cup back , added her brother 
no word yet , answered mr bobbsey 
that circus is traveling all over  cuba , and the letters i sent never seem to catch up to them 
however , i  am sending one on  ead now , to a city where they will soon give a show 
the fat lady will find it there waiting for her , and she may answer  then 
with this the childrn had to be content 
getting back home ,  flossie and freddie took out their sleds and went for a coaston a small  hill , not far from their home 
this was where the smaller childrn had  their fun , leaving the larger hill for the bigger girls and boys 
well , after this i think we all need something to cheer us up , said  papa bobbsey , who came home from the office early that day 
oh , have you got something good 
asked nan , for she saw a queer little  twinkle in her father s eyes , and she knew that this generally meant a  treat of some kind 
i have some good news , if you would like to hear it , he said , as he  drw a letter from his pocket 
is it to tell that some of our friends are coming to see us 
asked  bert 
well , yes , i think you will call it a visit from a friend  at least part of it , said papa bobbsey 
now listn 
this is a letter from the  fat lady in the circus 
what 
cried flossie  the one who has our cup 
the same , said mr bobbsey with a smile 
she has more than your  cup 
listn , and he read the letter 
it was too long to put it all in here , but it went on to say how the fat  lady really had the valuable silver cup belonging to the twins 
they loaned it to me to drnk from , she wrote , and when the train  stpped so suddenly , there was so much confusion that i put it in my  valise by mistke 
i have had it ever since and have been wondering how  i could send it back to you 
the circus went to cuba soon after that ,  and has been traveling around that island ever since 
i have only just received your lastletter asking me about the cup , or i would have  answered before 
if you will send me directions how to ship the cup to  you i shall be very glad to return it 
oh goodie 
cried freddie 
we will have our nice cup again 
is that all in the letter , papa , 
asked flossie 
no , not quite , he said 
i will read a little more , and be read  when our circus was wrecked we losta valuable trick dog 
he could  play soldier , say his prayers , turn somersaults , and do a number of  tricks 
the ringmastr feels very badly about losing him , and has tried  to locate him , but without success 
if you should hear of anyone near  you having such a dog we would be much obliged if you would send him to  us as he belongs to the circus 
there was a moment of silence after mr bobbsey read this , and then  freddie said  why that mustbe snap  our pet dog 
oh , papa you won t give him back  to the circus 
will you 
snap and snoop all of the bobbsey twins  nan , bert , flossie and freddie  looked so  serious over the prospect of losing snap that mr bobbsey had to laugh 
he justcouldn t help it 
well , i do not see anything to make fun over , said nan , with a little  pout 
why , you all act as though you had lostyour bestfriend  or were  going to 
well , snap is one of our bestfriends , aren t you snap 
stll , if he belongs to the circus i do not see but what i will have to  send him back , went on mr bobbsey , slowly 
at this flossie burstinto tears , and mr 
bobbsey , putting her arms  about the little girl , said to her husband  are you in earnestrichard 
do not tease the child 
i am not , mary 
the fat lady wrote justthat 
i believe the dog we  have does belong to the circus 
we will have to give him up i suppose , and mr 
bobbsey sighed , for  she had grown very much attached to the fine animal 
well , we won t have to send him back right away , said mr bobbsey 
i  will have to get more particulars 
i did not finish the fat lady s  letter 
what 
is there more news in it 
asked nan 
listn , said mr bobbsey , as he went on reading  we are sorry about losing our trick dog , the fat lady wrote , but i  picked up a big black cat when i walked out of the train 
i brought him  to cuba with me , and i am teaching him tricks 
he may be as valuable as  our dog was 
a black cat 
cried nan 
it s our snoop 
shouted freddie , yes , that s it 
the fat lady has  our cat as well as our cup 
oh , papa , make her give back our snoop 
mr bobbsey laughed 
you see how it is , he said 
she has our cat , and we have their dog 
we will have to give up our dog to get our cat 
the bobbsey twins had not thought of this before 
they looked stangely  at one another 
papa 
cried freddie , jumping up and down in his excitement , can t we  keep both  the circus dog and our cat 
oh , do please , let us 
maybe snap would fight snoop , said flossie 
we wouldn t want  that 
freddie thought for a moment 
i do not believe he would , he said at last well , said papa bobbsey , after a bit , i 11 see what i can do 
i will  write to the fat lady , telling her how to ship your silver cup , and also  how to send snoop 
i will ask if we can buy snap 
how will that do 
fine 
cried all the bobbsey twins at once , and they made a rush for  mr bobbsey , hugging and kissing him 
the letter was sent to the fat lady , and then came a time of anxious  waiting 
never before had the childrn seemed to care so much for snap 
one day a letter came , saying that the silver cup had been sent , and  also snoop , the cat 
what about snap , papa 
asked nan 
does she say the circus will sell him 
no , the man who owns him is away for a few days 
when he comes back he  will let me know 
anyhow , you will have your cup and cat back 
we want snap , too 
several more days passed 
they lengthened into a week , and stll no  news came from where the circus was   all the bobbsey twins could hope  was that their cat and cup were on the way , and that the man who owned  snap would consent to sell him 
the twins did not feel much like having fun 
there was a warm spell ,  and all the snow had melted 
one day an express wagon stpped in front of the bobbsey house 
it was a saturday , and there was no school , and , as it happened , all  four of the twins were in 
two boxes for you , mr 
bobbsey , said the drver , as he opened his  receipt book 
i will bring them in while you sign 
the man came up the walk with two boxes 
one was small , and the other  larger , with slats on one end 
from this box came a peculiar noise 
listn 
cried bert 
it s a cat 
shouted freddie 
it s snoop  our snoop 
cried flossie 
quickly the boxes were carried into the house 
bert got a hammer and  screw drver and soon had opened the one containing the black cat 
snap , the dog , walked slowly into the room 
oh dear 
cried flossie as she saw him , now maybe they will fight 
i will hold snap , volunteered freddie 
come on , snoop 
come out 
cried bert , as he pried off the lastslat 
meouw 
cried snoop , as he came slowly out of the box in which he had  ridden from cuba 
out walked the black cat 
he looked about him stangely for a moment ,  and then began to purr , and rubbed up againstflossie s legs 
they all looked anxiously at snap 
the dog glanced at the cat ,  stetched lazily and wagged his tail 
snoop came over to him , and the  two animals sniffed at each other , mr 
bobbsey holding snap by the  collar 
to the surprise of all , snoop rubbed againstthe legs of  the dog , and , on his part , snap , wagging his tail in friendly , welcoming  fashion , put out his red tongue and licked snoop s fur 
he is kissing snoop 
he is kissing snoop 
cried freddie 
yes , they love each other 
exclaimed flossie 
they are not going to  fight 
oh , how glad i am 
she danced in delight 
oh , if only we can keep snap now , said nan , while mr 
bobbsey ,  satisfied that the two animals would be friends , had opened the other  express box 
it contained the twins  silver cup , so long missing 
mr bobbsey came home soon after that his face was smiling 
oh , papa 
flossie greeted him , snoop came , and snap kissed him 
may we keep snap , papa 
asked freddie 
yes , was mr bobbsey s answer 
i have a letter from the circus man ,  and he will sell snap to me 
i have already sent the money 
there  is another letter from the fat lady , telling about some of the new  tricks she taught snoop , so you can make him do them 
oh 
oh 
oh 
cried the bobbsey twins in firelight , as they looked at  their two pets 
what lots of things have happened since we came back from the  seashore , said nan , little later 
i wonder if the restof the winter  will be as lively as this firstpart has been 
maybe , said bert with a smile 
whether it was or not you may learn by reading the next volume of  this series , to be called   the bobbsey twins at snow lodge , in which  we will once more hear of the doings of flossie , freddie nan and bert 
after reading the fat lady s second letter the twins got snoop to do  some of the tricks the cat had learned 
he was not as smart at them as  snap was at his , but then cats never do learn to do tricks as well as do  dogs 
stll everyone agreed that the fat lady had done her training well 
as  for snap , he and snoop became firmer friends every day , and often the  cat went to sleep on snap s back , or between his forepaws as he lay  stetched out in front of the fire 
the silver cup , which , with snoop , had gone on such a long journey ,  was put back in its place on the mantle , to be admired by all 
now my little stry has come to an end , but i hope you childrn who have  read it will care to hear more of the bobbsey twins and the things they  did 
i will say goodbye for a while , trustng to meet you all again

information about project gutenberg  since the monstr had broken his fast and , as was natural enough , his appetite had grown to be enormous , and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had justeaten up 
when he caught sight of cadmus , therefore , he set up another abominable hiss , and flung back his immense jaws , until his mouth looked like a great red cavern , at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his lastvictim , whom he had hardly had time to swallow 
cadmus was so enraged at the destuction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the drgon s jaws nor for his hundrds of sharp teeth 
drwing his sword , he rushed at the monstr , and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth 
this bold method of attacking him took the drgon by surprise 
for , in fact , cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat , that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him , nor do him the leastharm in the world 
thus , though the stuggle was a tremendous one , and though the drgon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail , yet , as cadmus was all the while slashing and stbbing at his very vitals , it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away 
he had not gone his length , however , when the brave cadmus gave him a sword thrustthat finished the battle 
creeping out of the gateway of the creature s jaws , there he beheld him stll wriggling his vastbulk , although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child 
do not you suppose that it made cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor , friendly people , who had followed the cow along with him 
it seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved , or to see them perish in one way or another 
here he was , after all his toils and troubles , in a solitary place , with not a single human being to help him build a hut 
what shall i do 
cried he aloud 
it were better for me to have been devoured by the drgon , as my poor companions were 
cadmus , said a voice but whether it came from above or below him , or whether it spoke within his own breast the young man could not tellcadmus , pluck out the drgon s teeth , and plant them in the earth 
this was a stange thing to do 
nor was it very easy , i should imagine , to dig out all those deeprooted fangs from the dead drgon s jaws 
cadmus toiled and tugged , and after pounding the monstous head almostto pieces with a great stne , he at lastcollected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two 
the next thing was to plant them 
this , likewise , was a tedious piece of work , especially as cadmus was already exhaustd with killing the drgon and knocking his head to pieces , and had nothing to dig the earth with , that i know of , unless it were his sword blade 
finally , however , a sufficiently large tract oœ ground was turned up , and sown with this new kind of seed 
although half of the drgon s teeth stll remained to be planted some other day 
cadmus , quite out of breath , stod leaning upon his sword , and wondering what was to happen next 
he had waited but a few moments , when he began to see a sight , which was as great a marvel as the mostmarvelous thing i ever told you about 
the sun was shining slantwise over the field , and showed all the moist dark soil justlike any other newlyplanted piece of ground 
all at once , cadmus fancied he saw something glistn very brightly , firstat one spot , then at another , and then at a hundrd and a thousand spots together 
on he perceived them to be the stel heads of spears , sprouting up everywhere like so many stlks of grain , and continually growing taller and taller 
next appeared a vastnumber of bright sword blades , thrustng themselves up in the same way 
a moment afterwards , the whole surface of the ground was broken by a multitude of polished brass helmets , coming up like a crop of enormous beans 
rapidly did they grow , that cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one 
in short , before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was , he beheld an abundant harvestof what looked like human beings , armed with helmets and breastlates , shields , swords , and spears 
before they were well out of the earth , they brandished their weapons , and clashed them one againstanother , seeming to think , little while as they had yet lived , that they had wastd too much of life without a battle 
every tooth of the drgon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief 
up sprouted also a great many trumpeters 
with the firstbreath that they drw , they put their brazen trumpets to their lips , and sounded a tremendous and earshattering blast so that the whole space , justnow so quiet and solitary , reverberated with the clash and clang of arms , the bray of warlike music , and the shouts of angry men 
enraged did they all look , that cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword 
how fortunate would it be for a great conqueror , if he could get a bushel of the drgon s teeth to sow 
cadmus , said the same voice which he had before heard , throw a stne into the midstof the armed men 
cadmus seized a large stne , and flinging it into the middle of the earth army , saw it stike the breastlate of a gigantic and fiercelooking warrior 
immediately on feeling the blow , he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had stuck him 
uplifting his weapon , he smote his next neighbor a blow that cleft his helmet asunder , and stetched him on the ground 
in an instnt , those nearestthe fallen warrior began to stike at one another with their swords , and stb with their spears 
the confusion spread wider and wider 
each man smote down his brother , and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory 
the trumpeters , all the while , blew their blast shriller and shriller 
each soldier shouted a battle cry , and often fell with it on his lips 
it was the stangestspectacle of causeless wrath , and of mischief for no good end , that had ever been witnessed 
after all , it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought , in which men have slain their brothers with justas little reason as these childrn of the drgon s teeth 
it ought to be considered , too , that the drgon people were made for nothing else 
whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another 
well , this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was stewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off 
of all the thousands that began the fight , there were only five left stnding 
these now rushed from different parts of the field , and , meeting in the middle of it , clashed their swords , and stuck at each other s hearts as fiercely as ever 
cadmus , said the voice again , bid those five warriors sheathe their swords 
they will help you to build the city 
without hesitating an instnt , cadmus stpped forward , with the aspect of a king and a leader , and extending his drwn sword amongstthem , spoke to the warriors in a strn and commanding voice 
sheathe your weapons 
forthwith , feeling themselves bound to obey him , the five remaining sons of the drgon s teeth made him a military salute with their swords , returned them to the scabbards , and stod before cadmus in a rank , eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain , while awaiting the word of command 
these five men had probably sprung from the biggestof the drgon s teeth , and were the boldestand stongestof the whole army 
they were almostgiants indeed , and had good need to be so , else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight 
they stll had a very furious look , and , if cadmus happened to glance aside , would glare at one another , with fire flashing out of their eyes 
it was stange , too , to observe how the earth , out of which they had so lately grown , was incrustd , here and there , on their bright breastlates , and even , begrimed their faces 
justas you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots , when pulled out of their native soil 
cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men , or some odd kind of vegetable 
although , on the whole , he concluded that there was human nature in them , because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons , and so ready to shed blood 
they looked him earnesty in the face , waiting for his next order , and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another , all over the wide world 
cadmus was wiser than these earthborn creatures , with the drgon s fierceness in them , and knew better how to use their stength and hardihood 
come 
you are strdy fellows 
make yourselves useful 
quarry some stnes with those great swords of yours , and help me to build a city 
the five soldiers grumbled a little , and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities , not to build them up 
cadmus looked at them with a strn eye , and spoke to them in a tone of authority , so that they knew him for their mastr , and never again thought of disobeying his commands 
they set to work in good earnest and toiled so diligently , that , in a very short time , a city began to make its appearance 
at first to be sure , the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition 
like savage beast , they would doubtless have done one another a mischief , if cadmus had not kept watch over them , and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts , when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes 
in course of time , they got accustmed to honestlabor , and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living at peace , and doing good to one s neighbor , than in stiking at him with a twoedged sword 
it may not be too much to hope that the restof mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earthbegrimed warriors , who sprang from the drgon s teeth 
now the city was built , and there was a home in it for each of the workmen 
the palace of cadmus was not yet erected , because they had left it till the last meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture , and make it very commodious , as well as sttely and beautiful 
after finishing the restof their labors , they all went to bed betimes , in order to rise in the gray of the morning , and get at leastthe foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall 
when cadmus arose , and took his way towards the site where the palace was to be built , followed by his five strdy workmen marching all in a row , what do you think he saw 
what should it be but the mostmagnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world 
it was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stne , and rose high into the air , with a splendid dome and a portico along the front , and carved pillars , and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king 
it had grown up out of the earth in almostas short a time as it had taken the armed hostto spring from the drgon s teeth 
what made the matter more stange , no seed of this sttely edifice ever had been planted 
when the five workmen beheld the dome , with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious , they gave a great shout 
long live king cadmus , they cried , in his beautiful palace 
the new king , with his five faithful followers at his heels , shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank  oh 
it was all very puzzling , but apparently these people in unfamiliar drss knew what they were about 
yet they were odd and the room was odd 
it seemed he was in some newly estblished place 
he had a sudden flash of suspicion 
surely this wasn t some hall of public exhibition 
if it was he would give warming  a piece of his mind 
it scarcely had that character 
in a place of public exhibition he would not have discovered himself naked 
suddenly , quite abruptly , he realised what had happened 
there was no perceptible interval of suspicion ,  no dawn to his knowledge 
abruptly he knew that his trance had lastd for a vastinterval 
as if by some processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that peered into his 
he looked at them stangely , full of intense emotion 
it seemed they read his eyes 
he framed his lips to speak and could not 
a queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almostat the moment of his discovery 
he looked at his bare feet , regarding then silently 
his impulse to speak passed 
he was trembling exceedingly 
they gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty tast , and the assurance of returning stength grew 
thatthat makes me feel better , he said hoarsely , and there were murmurs of respectful approval 
he knew now quite clearly 
he made to speak again , and again he could not 
he pressed his throat and tried a third time 
how long 
he asked in a level voice 
how long have i been asleep 
me considerable time , said the flaxenbearded man , glancing quickly at the others 
how long 
a very long time 
yesyes , said gr am , suddenly test 
i want is itit issome years 
many years 
there was somethingi forget what 
i feel confused 
you he sobbed 
you need not fence with me 
how long 
he stpped , breathing irregularly 
he squeezed his eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer 
they spoke in undertones 
five or six 
he asked faintly 
more 
very much more than that 
morel  more 
he looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles of his face 
he looked his queston 
many years , said the man with the red beard 
gr am stuggled into a sitting position 
he wiped a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand 
many years 
he repeated 
he shut his eyes tight , opened them , and sat looking about him , from one unfamiliar thing to another 
how many years 
he asked 
you mustbe prepared to be surprised 
well 
more than a gross of years 
he was irritated at the stange word 
more than a what 
two of them spoke together 
me quick remarks that were made about decimal he did not catch 
how long did you say 
asked gr am 
how long 
do not look like that 
tell me 
among the remarks in an undertone , his ear caught six words  more than a couple of centuries 
whats 
he cried , turning on the youth who he thought had spoken 
who says 
what was that 
a couple of centuries 
yes , said the man with the red beard 
two hundrd years 
gr am repeated the words 
he had been prepared to hear of a vastrepose , and yet these concrete centuries defeated him 
two hundrd years , he said again , with the figure of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind 
then , oh , but 
they said nothing 
youdid you say 
two hundrd years 
two centuries of years , said the man with the red beard 
there was a pause 
gr am looked at their faces and saw that what he had heard was indeed true 
it can t be , he said querulously 
i am draming 
trances 
trances do not last that is not rightthis is a joke you have played upon me 
tell mesome days ago , perhaps , i was walking along the coastof cornwall 
his voice failed him 
the man with the flaxen beard hesitated 
i am not very stong in histry , sir , he said weakly , and glanced at the others 
that was it , sir , said the youngstr 
boscaste , in the old duchy of cornwallit s in the southwestcountry beyond the dairy meadows 
there is a house there stll 
i have been there 
boscaste 
gr am turned his eyes to the youngstr 
that was itboscaste 
little boscaste 
i fell asleepsomewhere there 
i do not exactly remember 
i do not exactly remember 
he pressed his brows and whispered , more than two hundrd years 
i he began to speak quickly with a twitching face , but his heart was cold within him 
if it is two hundrd years , every soul i know , every human being that ever i saw or spoke to before i went to sleep , mustbe dead 
they did not answer him 
the queen and the royal family , her ministrs , of church and stte 
high and low , rich and poor , one with another is there england stll 
that s a comfort 
is there london 
e this is london , eh 
you are my assistnt custdian 
assistntcustdian 
these 
eh 
assistntcustdians to 
he sat with a gaunt stre on his face 
why am i here 
no 
do not talk 
be quiet 
let me he sat silent , rubbed his eyes , and , uncovering them , found another little glass of pinkish fluid held towards him 
he took the dose 
it was almostimmediately sustining 
directly he had taken it he began to weep naturally and refreshingly 
presently he looked at their faces , suddenly laughed through his tears , a little foolishly 
two hundrdyears  
he said 
he grimaced hystrically  and covered up his face again 
after a space he grew calm 
he sat up , his hands hanging over his knees in almostprecisely the same attitude in which isbistr had found him on the cliff at pentargen 
his attention was attracted by a thick domineering voice , the footstps of an advancing personage 
what are you doing 
why was i not warned 
surely you could tell 
meone will suffer for this 
the man mustbe kept quiet 
are the  doorways closed 
all the doorways 
he mustbe kept perfectly quiet 
he mustnot be told 
has he been told anything 
the man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark , and gr am looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short , fat , and thickset beardless man , with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin 
very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almostmet over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes , gave his face an oddly formidable expression 
he scowled momentarily at gr am and then his regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard 
these others , he said in a voice of extreme  irritation 
you had better go 
go 
certainlygo now 
see the doorways are closed as you go 
the two men addrssed turned obediently , after one reluctant glance at gr am , and instad of going through the archway as he expected , walked staight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway 
then came a stange thing 
a long stip of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap , hung over the two retreating men and fell again , and immediately gr am was alone with the new comer and the purplerobed man with the flaxen beard 
for a space the thickset man took not the slightestnotice of gr am , but proceeded to interrogate the otherobviously his subordinateupon the treatment  of their charge 
he spoke clearly , but in phrases only partially intelligible to gr am 
the awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but of constrnation and annoyance to him 
he was evidently  profoundly excited 
you mustnot confuse his mind by telling him things , he repeated again and again 
you mustnot confuse his mind 
his questons answered , he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression 
feel queer 
he asked 
very 
the world , what you see of it , seems stange to you 
i suppose i have to live in it , stange as it seems 
i suppose so , now 
in the firstplace , hadn t i better have some clothes 
they said the thickset man and stpped , and the flaxenbearded man met his eye and went away 
you will very speedily have clothes , said the thickset  man 
is it true indeed , that i have been asleep two hundrd 
asked gr am 
they have told you that , have they 
two hundrd  and three , as a matter of fact 
gr am accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed mouth 
he sat silent for a moment , and then asked a queston , is there a mill or dynamo near here 
he did not wait for an answer 
things have changed tremendously , i suppose 
he said 
what is that shouting 
he asked abruptly 
nothing , said the thickset man impatiently 
it s people 
you will understnd better laterperhaps 
as you say , things have changed 
he spoke shortly , his brows were knit , and he glanced about him like a man trying to decide in an emergency 
we mustget you clothes and so forth , at any rate 
better wait here until some can come 
no one will come near you 
you want shaving 
gr am rubbed his chin 
the man with the flaxen beard came back towards them , turned suddenly , listned for a moment , lifted his eyebrows at the older man , and hurried off through the archway towards the balcony 
the tumult of shouting grew louder , and the thickset man turned and listned also 
he cursed suddenly under his breath , and turned his eyes upon gr am with an unfriendly expression 
it was a surge of many voices , rising and falling , shouting and screaming , and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries , and then a snapping  like the crackling of dr stcks 
gr am stained his ears to drw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult 
he perceived , repeated again and again , a  certain formula 
for a time he doubted his ears 
surely these were the words   how us the sleeper 
show us the sleeper 
the thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway 
wild 
he cried , how do they know 
do they know 
or is it guessing 
there was perhaps an answer 
i can t come , said the thickset man 
i have him to see to 
shout from the balcony 
there was an inaudible reply 
say he is not awake 
anything 
i leave it to you 
he came hurrying back to gr am 
you musthave clothes at once , he said 
you cannot stp hereand it will be impossible to he rushed away , gr am shouting unanswered questons after him 
in a moment he was back 
i can t tell you what is happening 
it is too complex  to explain 
in a moment you shall have your clothes made 
yesin a moment 
then i can take you away from here 
you will find out our troubles soon enough 
those voices 
they were shouting 
mething about the sleeperthat s you 
they have some twistd idea 
i do not know what it is 
i know nothing 
a shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistnct mingling  of remote noises , and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room 
he listned for a moment , regarding a ball of crystl , nodded , and said a few indistnct words 
he walked to the wall through which the two men had vanished 
it rolled up again like a curtain , and he stod waiting 
gr am lifted his arm and was astnished to find what stength the restratives had given him 
he thrustone leg over the side of the couch and then the other 
his head no longer swam 
he could scarcely credit his rapid recovery 
he sat feeling his limbs 
the man with the flaxen beard reentered from the archway , and as he did so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man , and a lean , greybearded man , carrying a roll , and wearing a tightlyfitting costme of dark green , appeared therein 
this is the tailor , said the thickset man with an introductory gestre 
it will never do for you to wear that black 
i cannot understnd how it got here 
i shall 
i shall 
you will be as rapid as possible 
he said to the tailor 
the man in green bowed , and , advancing , seated himself by gr am on the bed 
his manner was calm , but his eyes were full of curiosity 
you will find the fashions altered , sire , he said 
he glanced from under his brows at the thickset man 
 , he opened the roller with a quick movement , and a confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his knees 
you lived , sire , in a period essentially cylindrcal the victorian 
with a tendency to the hemisphere in hats 
circular curves always 
now he flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of a  keyless watch , whirled the knob , and beholda little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial , walking and turning 
the tailor caught up a pattern of bluish white satin 
that is my conception of your immediate treatment , he said 
the thickset man came and stod by the shoulder of gr am 
we have very little time , he said 
trustme , said the tailor 
my machine follows 
what do you think of this 
what is that 
asked the man from the nineteenth century 
in your days they showed you a fashionplate , said the tailor , but this is our modern development see here 
the little figure repeated its evolutions , but in a different costme 
or this , and with a click another small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to the dial 
the tailor was very quick in his movements , and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these things 
it rumbled again , and a crophaired anaemic lad with features of the chinese type , clad in coarse pale blue canvas , appeared together with a complicated  machine , which he pushed noiselessly on little castrs into the room 
incontinently the little kinetoscope was drpped , gr am was invited to stnd in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some instuctions to the crophaired lad , who answered in guttural tones and with words gr am did not recognise 
the boy then went to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the corner , and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in little discs , pulling them out until the discs were flat againstthe body of gr am , one at each shoulder blade , one at the elbows , one at the neck and so forth , so that at lastthere were , perhaps , two score of them upon his body and limbs 
at the same time , some other person entered the room by the lift , behind gr am 
the tailor set moving a mechanism  that initiated a faintsounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine , and in another moment he was knocking up the levers and gr am was released 
the tailor replaced his cloak of black , and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some refreshing fluid 
gr am saw over the rim of the glass a palefaced young man regarding him with a singular fixity 
the thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully ,  and now turned and went through the archway towards the balcony , from which the noise of a distnt crowd stll came in gust and cadences 
the cropheaded  lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine 
they ran the entire thing on its easy , noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where a twistd cable looped rather gracefully from the wall 
they made some connexion and the machine became energetic and swift 
what is that doing 
asked gr am , pointing with the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer 
is that some sort of forcelaid on 
yes , said the man with the flaxen beard 
who is that 
he indicated the archway behind him 
the man in purple stoked his little beard , hesitated , and answered in an undertone , he is howard , your chief guardian 
you see , sire ,it s a little difficult to explain 
the council appoints a guardian and assistnts 
this hall has under certain restictions been public 
in order that people might satisfy themselves 
we have barred the doorways for the firsttime 
i thinkif you do not mind , i will leave him to explain 
odd said gr am 
guardian 
council 
turning his back on the new comer , he asked in an undertone , why is this man glaring at me 
is he a mesmerist  mesmerist he is a capillotomist capillotomist yesone of the chief 
his yearly fee is sixdoz lions 
it sounded sheer nonsense 
gr am snatched at the lastphrase with an unstady mind 
sixdoz lions 
he said 
did not you have lions 
i suppose not 
you had the old pounds 
they are our monetary units 
what was that you saidsixdoz 
yes 
six dozen , sire 
of course things , even these little things , have altered 
you lived in the days of the decimal systm , the arab systmtens , and little hundrds and thousands 
we have eleven numerals now 
we have single figures for both ten and eleven , two figures for a dozen , and a dozen dozen makes a gross , a great hundrd , you know , a dozen gross a dozand , and a dozand dozand a myriad 
very simple 
i suppose so , said gr am 
about this capwhat was it 
the man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder 
here are your clothes 
he said 
gr am turned round sharply and saw the tailor stnding at his elbow smiling , and holding some palpably new garments over his arm 
the cropheaded boy , by means of one finger , was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had arrived 
gr am stred at the completed suit 
you do not mean to say 
justmade , said the tailor 
he drpped the garments  at the feet of gr am , walked to the bed on which gr am had so recently been iying , flung out the translucent mattress , and turned up the looking glass 
as he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner 
the man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by the archway 
the tailor was assistng gr am into a dark purple combination garment , stckings , vest and pants in one , as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the balcony 
they began speaking quickly in an undertone , their bearing had an unmistkable quality of anxiety 
over the purple undergarment came a i complex but graceful garment of bluish white , and i gr am was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself , sallowfaced , unshaven and shaggy stll , but at leastnaked no longer , and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful 
i mustshave , he said regarding himself in the glass 
in a moment , said howard 
the persistnt stre ceased 
the young man closed his eyes , reopened them , and with a lean hand extended , advanced on gr am 
he stpped , with his hand slowly gestculating , and looked about him 
a seat , said howard impatiently , and in a moment the flaxenbearded man had a chair behind gr am 
sit down , please , said howard 
gr am hesitated , and in the other hand of the wildeyed  man he saw the glint of stel 
do not you understnd , sire 
cried the flaxenbearded  man with hurried politeness 
he is going to cut your hair 
oh 
cried gr am enlightened 
you called him a capillotomistrecisely  
he is one of the finestartist in the world 
gr am sat down abruptly 
the flaxenbearded man disappeared 
the capillotomistcame forward with graceful gestres , examined gr am s ears and surveyed him , felt the back of his head , and would have sat down again to regard him but for howard s audible impatience 
forthwith with rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements he shaved gr am s chin , clipped his moustche , and cut and arranged his hair 
all this he did without a word , with something of the rapt air of a poet inspired 
as soon as he had finished gr am was handed a pair of shoes 
suddenly a loud voice shoutedit seemed from a piece of machinery in the cornerat onceat once 
the people know all over the city 
work is being stpped 
work is being stpped 
wait for nothing , but come 
this shout appeared to perturb howard exceedingly 
by his gestres it seemed to gr am that he hesitated between two directions 
abruptly he went towards the corner where the apparatus stod about the little crystl ball 
as he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the archway that had continued  during all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound , roared as if it were sweeping past and fell again as if receding swiftly 
it drw gr am after it with an irresistble attraction 
he glanced at the thickset man , and then obeyed his impulse 
in two stides he was down the stps and in the passage , and , in a score he was out upon the balcony upon which | the three men had been stnding 
chapter v the moving ways he went to the railings of the balcony and stred upward 
an exclamation of surprise at his appearance ,  and the movements of a number of people came from the spacious area below 
his firstimpression was of overwhelming architecture 
the place into which he looked was an aisle of titanic buildings , curving spaciously in either direction 
overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge width of the place , and a tracery of translucent material shut out the sky 
gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down through the girders and wires 
here and there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables 
a cliff of edifice hung above him , he perceived as he glanced upward , and the opposite facade was grey and dim and broken by great archings , circular perforations , balconies ,  buttresses , turret projections , myriads of vastwindows , and an intricate scheme of architectural relief 
athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering 
here and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stutness were fastned , and droped in a step curve to circular openings on the opposite side of the space , and even as gr am noted these a remote and tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrestd his attention 
this little  figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher fastning of one of these festons , hanging  forward from a little ledge of masonry and handling some wellnigh invisible stings dependent from the line 
suddenly , with a swoop that sent gr am s heart into his mouth , this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round opening on the hither side of the way 
gr am had been looking up as he came out upon the balcony , and the things he saw above and opposed to him had at firstseized his  attention to the exclusion of anything else 
suddenly he discovered the roadway 
it was not a roadway at all , as gr am understod such things , for in the nineteenth century the only roads and steets were beaten tracks of motionless earth , josting rivulets of vehicles between narrow footways 
this roadway was three hundrd feet across , and it moved 
it moved , all save the middle , the lowestpart 
for a moment , the motion dazzled his mind 
he understod 
under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to gr am s right , an endless flow rushing along as fastas a nineteenth century express train , an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures of the steet 
upon it were seats , and here and there little kiosks , but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein 
from this nearestand swiftestplatform a series of others descended to the centre of the space 
each moved to the right , each perceptibly slower than the one above it , but the difference in pace was small enough to permit  anyone to stp from any platform to the one adjacent ,  and so walk uninterruptedly from the swiftestto the motionless middle way 
beyond this middle way was another series of endless platforms rushing with varying pace to gr am s left 
seated in crowds upon the two widestand swiftestplatforms , or stpping  from one to another down the stps , or swarming over the central space , was an innumerable and  wonderfully diversified multitude of people 
you mustnot stp here , shouted howard suddenly  at his side 
you mustcome away at once 
gr am made no answer 
he heard without hearing 
the platforms ran with a roar and the people were shouting 
he perceived women and girls with flowing hair , beautifully robed , with bands crossing between the breast 
these firstcame out of the confusion 
he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costme was the pale blue that the tailor s boy had worn 
he became aware of cries of the sleeper 
what has happened to the sleeper 
it seemed as though the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of human faces , and then stll more thickly 
he saw pointing fingers 
he perceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade justopposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blueclad people 
me sort of stuggle had sprung into life 
people seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on either side , and carried away againsttheir will 
they would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick of the confusion , and run back towards the conflict 
it is the sleeper 
verily it is the sleeper , shouted  voices 
that is never the sleeper , shouted others 
more and more faces were turned to him 
at the intervals along this central area gr am noted openings , pits , apparently the heads of stircases going down with people ascending out of them and descending into them 
the stuggle it seemed centred about the one of these nearestto him 
people were running down the moving platforms to this , leaping dexterously from platform to platform 
the clustring  people on the higher platforms seemed to divide their interestbetween this point and the balcony 
a number of strdy little figures clad in a uniform of bright red , and working methodically together , were employed it seemed in preventing access to this descending stircase 
about them a crowd was rapidly accumulating 
their brilliant colour contrastd vividly with the whitishblue of their antagonist , for the stuggle was indisputable 
he saw these things with howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm 
then suddenly howard was gone and he stod alone 
he perceived that the cries of the sleeper grew in volume , and that the people on the nearer platform were stnding up 
the nearer swifter platform he perceived was empty to the right of him , and far across the space the platform running in the opposite direction was coming crowded and passing away bare 
with incredible swiftness a vastcrowd had gathered in the central space before his eyes 
a dense swaying mass of people , and the shouts grew from a fitful crying  to a voluminous incessant clamour  the sleeper 
the sleeper 
yells and cheers , a waving of garments  and cries of stp the ways 
they were also crying another name stange to gr am 
it sounded like ostog 
the slower platforms were soon thick with active people , running againstthe movement so as to keep themselves opposite to him 
stp the ways , they cried 
agile figures ran up swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearestto him , were borne rapidly pasthim , shouting stange ,  unintelligible things , and ran back obliquely to the central way 
one thing he distnguished  it is indeed the sleeper 
it is indeed the sleeper , they testfied 
for a space gr am stod without a movement 
he became vividly aware that all this concerned him 
he was pleased at his wonderful popularity , he bowed , and , seeking a gestre of longer range , waved his arm 
he was astnished at the violence of uproar that this provoked 
the tumult about the descending stirway rose to furious violence 
he became aware of crowded balconies , of men sliding along ropes , of men in trapezelike seats hurling athwart the space 
he heard voices behind him , a number of people descending the stps through the archway 
he suddenly  perceived that his guardian howard was back again and gripping his arm painfully , and shouting inaudibly in his ear 
he turned , and howard s face was white 
come back , he heard 
they will stp the ways 
the whole city will be in confusion 
he perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars behind howard , the redhaired man , the man with the flaxen beard , a tall man in vivid vermilion , a crowd of others in red carrying stves , and all these people had anxious eager faces 
get him away , cried howard 
why 
i do not see you mustcome away 
his face and eyes were resolute , too 
gr am s glances went from face to face , and he was suddenly aware of that mostdisagreeable flavour in life , compulsion 
me one gripped his arm 



he was being drgged away 
it seemed as though the tumult suddenly became two , as if half the shouts that had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung into the passages of the great building behind him 
marvelling and confused , feeling an impotent desire to resist gr am was half led , half thrust along the passage of blue pillars , and suddenly he found himself  alone with howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward 
chapter vi the hall of the atlas from the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when gr am found himself in the lift , was altogether barely five minutes 
as yet the haze of his vastinterval of sleep hung about him , as yet the initial stangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched everything with wonder ,  with a sense of the irrational , with something of the quality of a realistc dram 
he was stll detached , an astnished spectator , stll but half involved in life 
what he had seen , and especially the lastcrowded tumult , framed in the setting of the balcony , had a spectacular turn , like a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre 
i do not understnd , he said 
what was the trouble 
my mind is in a whirl 
why were they shouting 
what is the danger 
we have our troubles , said howard 
his eyes avoided gr am s enquiry 
this is a time of unrest and , in fact , your appearance , your waking justnow , has a sort of connexion he spoke jerkily , like a man not quite sure of his breathing 
he stpped abruptly 
i do not understnd , said gr am 
it will be clearer later , said howard 
he glanced uneasily upward , as though he found the progress of the lift slow 
i shall understnd better , no doubt , when i have seen my way about a little , said gr am puzzled 
it 
will beit is bound to be perplexing 
at present it is all so stange 
anything seems possible 
anything in the details even 
your counting , i understnd , is different 
the lift stpped , and they stpped out into a narrow but very long passage between high walls , along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables 
what a huge place this is 
is it all one building 
what place is it 
this is one of the city ways for various public services 
light and so forth 
was it a social troublethatin the great roadway place 
how are you governed 
have you stll a police 
several , said howard 
several 
about fourteen 
i do not understnd 
very probably not 
our social order will probably seem very complex to you 
to tell you the truth , i do not understnd it myself very clearly 
nobody does 
you will , perhapsbye and bye 
we have to go to the council 
gr am s attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his inquiries and the people in the  passages and halls they were traversing 
for a moment his mind would be concentrated upon howard and the halting answers he made , and then he would lose  the thread in response to some vivid unexpected impression 
along the passages , in the halls , half the people seemed to be men in the red uniform 
the pale blue canvas that had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear 
invariably these men looked at him , and saluted him and howard as they passed 
he had a clear vision of entering a long corridor , and there were a number of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class 
he saw no teacher , but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice proceeded 
the girls regarded him and his conductor , he thought , with curiosity and astnishment 
he was hurried on before he could form a clear idea of the gathering 
he judged they knew howard and not himself , and that they wondered who he was 
this howard , it seemed , was a person of importance 
then he was also merely gr am s guardian 
that was odd 
there came a passage in twilight , and into this passage a footway hung so that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon , but no more of them 
vague impressions of galleries and of casual astnished passersby turning round to stre after the two of them with their redclad guard 
the stmulus of the restratives he had taken was only temporary 
he was speedily fatigued by this excessive hast 
he asked howard to slacken his speed 
presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great steet space , but this was glazed and did not open , and they were too high for him to see the moving platforms below 
he saw people going to and fro along cables and along stange , fraillooking ridges 
thence they passed across the steet and at a vastheight above it 
they crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass , so clear that it made him giddy even to remember it 
the floor of it also was of glass 
from his memory of the cliffs between new quay and boscaste , so remote in time , and so recent in his experience , it seemed to him that they mustbe near four hundrd feet above the moving ways 
he stpped , looked down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red multitudes , minute and fore shortened , stuggling and gestculating stll towards the little balcony far below , a little toy balcony , it seemed , where he had so recently been stnding 
a thin haze and the glare of the mighty globes of light obscured everything 
a man seated in a little open work cradle shot by from some point stll higher than the little narrow bridge , rushing down a cable as swiftly almostas if he were falling 
gr am stpped involuntarily to watch this stange passenger vanish in a great circular opening below , and then his eyes went back to the tumultuous stuggle 
along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots 
this broke up into individuals as it approached the balcony , and went pouring down the slower ways towards the dense stuggling crowd on the central area 
these men in red appeared to be armed with stcks or truncheons 
they seemed to be stiking and thrustng 
a great shouting , cries of wrath , screaming , burstout and came up to gr am , faint and thin 
go on , cried howard , laying hands on him 
another man rushed down a cable 
gr am suddenly  glanced up to see whence he came , and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of cables and girders , dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of windmills , and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky 
howard had thrusthim forward across the bridge , and he was in a little narrow passage  decorated with geometrical patterns 
i want to see more of that , cried gr am , resistng 
no , no , cried howard , stll gripping his arm 
this way 
you mustgo this way 
the men in red following them seemed ready to enforce his orders 
me negroes in a curious wasplike uniform of black and yellow appeared down the passage , and one hastned  to throw up a sliding shutter that had seemed a door to gr am , and led the way through it 
gr am found himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber 
the attendant in black and yellow crossed this , thrustup a second shutter and stod waiting 
this place had the appearance of an anteroom 
he saw a number of people in the central space , and at the opposite end a large and imposing doorway at the top of a flight of stps , heavily curtained but giving a glimpse of some stll larger hall beyond 
he perceived white men in red and other negroes in black and yellow  stnding stffly about those portals 
as they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below , the sleeper , and was aware of a turning of heads , a hum of observation 
they entered another little passage in the wall of this antechamber , and then he found himself on an ironrailed gallery of metal that passed round the side of the great hall he had already seen through the curtains 
he entered the place at the corner , so that he received the fullestimpression of its huge proportions 
the black in the wasp uniform stod aside like a welltrained servant , and closed the valve behind him 
compared with any of the places gr am had see thus far , this second hall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness 
on a pedestl at the remote end , and more brilliantly lit than any other object , was a gigantic white figure of atlas , stong and stenuous , the globe upon his bowed shoulders 
it was the firstthing to stike his attention , it was so vast so patiently and painfully real , so white and simple 
save for this figure and for a dais in the centre , the wide floor of the place was a shining vacancy 
the dais was remote in the greatness of the area 
it would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group of seven men who stod about a table on it , and gave an inkling of its proportions 
they were all drssed in white robes , they seemed to have arisen that moment from their seats , and they were regarding gr am stadfasty 
at the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances 
howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this mighty labouring figure 
he stpped 
the two men in red who had followed them into the gallery came and stod on either hand of gr am 
you mustremain here , murmured howard , for a few moments , and , without waiting for a reply , hurried away along the gallery 
why 
began gr am 
he moved as if to follow howard , and found his path obstucted by one of the men in red 
you have to wait here , sire , said the man in red 
why 
orders , sire 
whose orders 
our orders , sire 
gr am looked his exasperation 
what place is this 
he said presently 
who are those men 
they are the lords of the council , sire 
what council 
the council 
oh 
the council 
he perceived there were now eight , though how the newcomer had arrived he had not observed 
they made no gestres of greeting 
they stod regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might have stod in the steet regarding a distnt balloon that had suddenly floated into view 
what council could it be that gathered there , that little body of men beneath the significant white atlas , secluded from every eavesdrpper in this impressive spaciousness 
why should he be brought to them , and be looked at stangely and spoken of inaudibly 
howard appeared beneath , walking quickly across the polished floor towards them 
as he drw near he bowed and performed certain peculiar movements , apparently of a ceremonious nature 
he ascended the stps of the dais , and stod by the apparatus at the end of the table 
gr am watched that visible inaudible conversation 
occasionally , one of the whiterobed men would glance towards him 
he stained his ears in vain 
the gestculation of two of the speakers became  animated 
he glanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants 



when he looked again howard was extending his hands and moving his head like a man who protest 
he was interrupted , it seemed , by one of the whiterobed men rapping the table 
the conversation lastd an interminable time to gr am s sense 
his eyes rose to the stll giant at whose feet the council sat 
ce they wandered at lastto the walls of the hall 
it was decorated in long painted panels of a quasijpanese type , many of them very beautiful 
these panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark metal , which passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries , and the great stuctural lines of the interior 
the facile grace of these panels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the centre of the scheme 
gr am s eyes came back to the council , and howard was descending the stps 
as he drw nearer his features could be distnguished , and gr am saw that he was flushed and blowing out his cheeks 
his countenance was stll distrbed when presently he reappeared along the gallery 
this way , he said concisely , and they went on in silence to a little door that opened at their approach 
the two men in red stpped on either side of this door 
howard and gr am passed in , and gr am , glancing back , saw the whiterobed council stll stnding in a close group and looking at him 
the door closed behind him with a heavy thud , and for the firsttime since his awakening he was in silence 
the floor , even , was noiseless to his feet 
howard opened another door , and they were in the firstof two contiguous chambers furnished in white and green 
what council was that 
began gr am 
what were they discussing 
what have they to do with me 
howard closed the door carefully ,  heaved a huge sigh , and said something in an undertone 
he walked slanting ways across the room and turned , blowing out his cheeks again 
ugh 
he grunted , a man relieved 
gr am stod regarding him 
you mustunderstnd , began howard abruptly , avoiding gr am s eyes , that our social order is very complex 
a half explanation , a bare unqualified sttement would give you false impressions 
as a matter of factit is a case of compound interestpartlyyour small fortune , and the fortune of your cousin warming which was left to youand certain other beginningshave become very considerable 
in other ways that will be hard for you to understnd ,  you have become a person of significanceof very considerable significanceinvolved in the world s affairs 
he stpped 
yes 
we have grave social troubles 
yes 
things have come to such a pass that , in fact , is advisable to seclude you here 
keep me prisoner 
exclaimed gr am 
wellto ask you to keep in seclusion 
gr am turned on him 
this is stange 
he said 
no harm will be done you 
no harm  
you mustbe kept here   while i learn my position , i presume 
precisely 
very well then 
begin 
why harm 
not now 
why not 
it is too long a stry , sire 
all the more reason i should begin at once 
you say i am a person of importance 
what was that shouting i heard 
why is a great multitude shouting and excited because my trance is over , and who are the men in white in that huge council chamber 
all in good time , sire , said howard 
not crudely , not crudely 
this is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind 
your awakening 
no one expected your awakening 
the council is consulting 
what council 
the council you saw 
gr am made a petulant movement 
this is not right , he said 
i should be told what is happening 
you mustwait 
really you mustwait 
gr am sat down abruptly 
i suppose since i have waited so long to resume life , he said , that i mustwait a little longer 
that is better , said howard 
yes , that is much better 
i mustleave you alone 
for a space 
while i attend the discussion in the council 
i am sorry 
he went towards the noiseless door , hesitated and vanished 
gr am walked to the door , tried it , found it securely  fastned in some way he never came to understnd ,  turned about , paced the room restessly , made the circuit of the room , and sat down 
he remained sitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow , biting his finger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions of this firsthour of awakened life 
the vastmechanical spaces , the endless series of chambers and passages , the great stuggle that roared and splashed through these stange ways , the little group of remote unsympathetic men beneath the colossal atlas , howard s mystrious behaviour 
there was an inkling of some vastinheritance  already in his minda vastinheritance perhaps  misappliedof some unprecedented importance and opportunity 
what had he to do 
this room s secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonment 
it came into gr am s mind with irresistble conviction  that this series of magnificent impressions was a dram 
he tried to shut his eyes and succeeded , but that timehonoured device led to no awakening 
presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments of the two small rooms in which he found himself 
in a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stpped astnished 
he was clad in a graceful costme  of purple and bluish white , with a little greyshot beard trimmed to a point , and his hair , its blackness steaked now with bands of grey , arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but graceful manner 
he seemed a man of fiveandforty perhaps 
for a moment he did not perceive this was himself 
a flash of laughter came with the recognition 
to call on old warming like this 
he exclaimed , and make him take me out to lunch 
he thought of meeting firstone and then another of the few familiar acquaintances of his early manhood , and in the midstof his amusement realised that every soul with whom he might jesthad died many score of years ago 
the thought smote him abruptly and keenly 
he stpped short , the expression of his face changed to a white constrnation 
the tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade of that wonderful steet reasserted itself 
the shouting multitudes came back clear and vivid , and those remote , inaudible , unfriendly councilors  in white 
he felt himself a little figure , very  small and ineffectual , pitifully conspicuous 
all about him , the world wasstange 
chapter vii in the silent rooms presently gr am resumed his examination of his apartments 
curiosity kept him moving in spite of his fatigue 
the inner room , he perceived , was high , and its ceiling dome shaped  , with an oblong aperture in the centre , opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad vans seemed to be rotating , apparently drving  the air up the shaft 
the faint humming note of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet place 
as these vans sprang up one after the other , gr am could get transient glimpses of the sky 
he was surprised to see a str 
this drw his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these rooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the cornices 
there were no windows 
he began to recall that along all the vastchambers and passages he had traversed with howard he had observed no windows at all 
had there been windows 
there were windows on the steet indeed , but were they for light 
or was the whole city lit day and night for evermore , so that there was no night there 
another thing dawned upon him 
there was no fireplace in either room 
was the season summer , and were these merely summer apartments , or was the whole city uniformly heated or cooled 
he became  interestd in these questons , began examining the smooth texture of the walls , the simply constucted bed , the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedrom service was practically abolished 
over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament , a bare grace of form and colour , that he found very pleasing to the eye 
there were several very comfortable chairs , a light table on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses , and two plates bearing a clear substnce like jelly 
he noticed there were no books , no newspapers , no  writing materials 
the world has changed indeed , he said 
he observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of peculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that harmonized with the decorative scheme of the room , and in the centre of this side projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a white smooth face to the room 
a chair faced this 
he had a transitory idea that these cylinders might be books , or a modern substtute for books , but at firstit did not seem so 
the lettering on the cylinders puzzled him 
at firstsight it seemed like russian 
he noticed a  suggeston of mutilated english about certain of the words 
oi man huwdbi kin forced itself on him as the man who would be king 
phonetic spelling , he said 
he remembered  reading a stry with that title , then he recalled the stry vividly , one of the beststries in the world 
this thing before him was not a book as he understod it 
he puzzled out the titles of two adjacent  cylinders 
the heart of darkness ,  he had never heard of before nor  the madonna of the future no doubt if they were indeed stries , they were by postvictorian authors 
he puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it 
he turned to the square apparatus  and examined that 
he opened a sort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within , and on the upper edge a little std like the std of an electric bell 
he pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased 
he became aware of voices and music , and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front face 
he suddenly realised what this might be , and stpped back to regard it 
on the flat surface was now a little picture , very vividly coloured , and in this picture were figures that moved 
not only did they move , but they were conversing  in clear small voices 
it was exactly like reality viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through a long tube 
his interestwas seized at once by the situation , which presented a man pacing up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant woman 
both were in the picturesque costme that seemed so stange to gr am 
i have worked , said the man , but what have you been doing 

he forgot everything else , and sat down in the chair 
within five minutes he heard himself named , heard when the sleeper wakes , used jestngly as a proverb for remote postonement , and passed himself by , a thing remote and incredible 
in a little while he knew those two people like l  
intimate friends 
at lastthe miniature drma came to an end , and the square face of the apparatus was blank again 
it was a stange world into which he had been permitted  to see , unscrupulous , pleasure seeking , energetic ,  subtle , a world too of dire economic stuggle 
there were allusions he did not understnd , incidents that conveyed stange suggestons of altered moral ideals , flashes of dubious enlightenment 
the blue canvas that bulked so largely in his firstimpression of the city ways appeared again and again as the  costme of the common people 
he had no doubt the stry was contemporary , and its intense realism was undeniable 
the end had been a tragedy that oppressed him 
he sat string at the blankness 
he strted and rubbed his eyes 
he had been so absorbed in the latterday substtute for a novel , that he awoke to the little green and white room with more than a touch of the surprise of his firstawakening 
he stod up , and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland 
the clearness of the kinetoscope drma passed , and the stuggle in the vastplace of steets , the ambiguous council , the swift phases of his waking hour , came back 
these people had spoken of the council with suggestons of a vague universality of power 
they had spoken of the sleeper 
it had not really stuck him vividly at the time that he was the sleeper 
he had to recall precisely what they had said 
he walked into the bedrom and peered up through the quick intervals of the revolving fan 
as the fan swept round , a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery came in rhythmic eddies 
all else was silence 
though the perpetual day stll irradiated his apartments ,  he perceived the little intermittent stip of sky was now deep blueblack almost with a dustof little strs 
he resumed his examination of the rooms 
he could find no way of opening the padded door , no bell nor other means of calling for attendance 
his feeling  of wonder was in abeyance 
he was curious , anxious for information 
he wanted to know exactly how he stod to these new things 
he tried to compose  himself to wait until someone came to him 
presently he became restess and eager for information ,  for distaction , for fresh sensations 
he went back to the apparatus in the other room , and had soon puzzled out the method of replacing the cylinders by others 
as he did so , it came into his mind that it mustbe these little appliances had fixed the language so that it was stll clear and understnd able after two hundrd years 
the haphazard cylinders  he substtuted displayed a musical fantasia 
at firstit was beautiful , and then it was sensuous 
he presently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version of the stry of tannhauser 
the music was unfamiliar 
the rendering was realistc , and with a contemporary unfamiliarity 
tannhauser did not go to a venusberg , but to a pleasure city 
what was a pleasure city 
a dram , surely , the fancy of a fantastc , voluptuous writer 
he became interestd , curious 
the stry developed  with a flavour of stangely twistd sentimentality 
suddenly he did not like it 
he liked it less as it proceeded 
he had a revulsion of feeling 
these were no pictures ,  no idealisations , but photographed realities 
he wanted no more of the twentysecond century venusberg 
he forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth century art , and gave way to an archaic indignation 
he rose , angry and half ashamed at himself  for witnessing this thing even in solitude 
he pulled forward the apparatus , and with some violence sought for a means of stpping its action 
mething snapped 
a violet spark stng and convulsed his arm and the thing was stll 
when he attempted next day to replace these tannhauser cylinders by another pair , he found the apparatus broken 



he stuck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro , stuggling with intolerable vastimpressions 
the things he had derived from the cylinders and the things he had seen , conflicted , confused him 
it seemed to him the mostamazing thing of all that in his thirty years of life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming times 
we were making the future , he said , and hardly any of us troubled to think what future we were making 
here it is 
what have they got to , what has been done 
how do i come into the midstof it all 
the vastess of steet and house he was prepared for , the multitudes of people 
conflicts in the city ways 
the systmatised  sensuality of a class of rich men 
he thought of bellamy , the hero of whose socialistc  utopia had so oddly anticipated this actual experience 
here was no utopia , no socialistc stte 
he had already seen enough to realise that the ancient antithesis of luxury , wast and sensuality on the one hand and abject poverty on the other , stll prevailed 
he knew enough of the essential factors of life to understnd that correlation 
not only were the buildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in the steet gigantic , but the voices he had heard in the ways , the uneasiness of howard , the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent 
what country was he in 
stll england it seemed , and yet stangely unenglish 
his mind glanced at the restof the world , and saw only an enigmatical veil 
he prowled about his apartment , examining everything  as a caged animal might do 
he felt very tired , felt that feverish exhauston that does not admit of rest he listned for long spaces under the ventilator to catch some distnt echo of the tumults he felt mustbe proceeding in the city 
he began to talk to himself 
two hundrd and three years 
he said to himself over and over again , laughing stpidly 
i am two hundrd and thirtythree years old 
the oldestinhabitant 
surely they haven t reversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the rule of the oldest my claims are indisputable 
mumble , mumble 
i remember the bulgarian  atrocities as though it was yestrday 
tis a great age 
ha ha 
he was surprised at firstto hear himself laughing , and then laughed again deliberately  and louder 
he realised that he was behaving foolishly 
stady , he said 
stady 
his pacing became more regular 
this new world , he said 
i do not understnd it 
why 



it is all why 
i suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things let me try and remember justhow it began 
he was surprised at firstto find how vague the memories of his firstthirty years had become 
he remembered fragments , for the mostpart trivial moments , things of no great importance that he had observed 
his boyhood seemed the mostaccessible at first he recalled school books and certain lessons in mensuration 
he revived the more salient features of his life , memories of the wife long since dead , her magic influence now gone beyond corruption ,  of his rivals and friends and betrayers , of the swift decision of this issue and that , and then of his  , lastyears of misery , of fluctuating resolves , and at lastof his stenuous stdies 
in a little while he perceived he had it all again 
dim perhaps , like metal long laid aside , but in no way defective or injured , capable of repolishing 
the hue of it was a deepening misery 
was it worth repolishing 
by a miracle he had been lifted out of a life that had become intolerable 
he reverted to his present condition 
he wrested with the facts in vain 
it became an inextricable tangle 
he saw the sky through the ventilator pink with dawn 
an old persuasion came out of the dark recesses  of his memory 
i mustsleep , he said 
it appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distess  and from the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs 
he went to the stange little bed , lay down and was presently asleep 
he was destned to become very familiar indeed with these apartments before he left them , for he remained imprisoned for three days 
during that time no one , except howard , entered his prison 
the marvel  of his fate mingled with and in some way minimised  the marvel of his survival 
he had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this unaccountable solitude 
howard came regularly with subtly sustining and nutritive fluids , and light and pleasant foods , quite stange to gr am 
he always closed the door carefully as he entered 
on matters of detail he was increasingly obliging , but the bearing of gr am on the great issues that were evidently  being contestd so closely beyond the soundproof  walls that enclosed him , he would not elucidate 
he evaded , as politely as possible , every queston on the position of affairs in the outer world 
in those three days gr am s incessant thoughts went far and wide 
all that he had seen , all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing , worked together in his mind 
almostevery possible interpretation of his position he debatedeven as it chanced , the right interpretation 
things that presently  happened to him , came to him at lastcredible , by virtue of this seclusion 
when at length the moment of his release arrived , it found him prepared 
howard s bearing went far to deepen gr am s impression of his own stange importance 
the door between its opening and closing seemed to admit with him a breath of momentous happening 
his enquiries  became more definite and searching 
howard retreated through protest and difficulties 
the awakening  was unforeseen , he repeated 
it happened to have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion 
to explain it i musttell you the histry of a gross and a half of years , protestd howard 
the thing is this , said gr am 
you are afraid of something i shall do 
in some way i am arbitratori might be arbitrator 
it is not that 
you havei may tell you this muchthe automatic increase of your property puts great possibilities of interference in your hands 
in certain other ways you have influence , with your eighteenth century notions 
nineteenth century , corrected gr am 
with your old world notions , anyhow , ignorant as you are of every feature of our stte 
am i a fool 
certainly not 
do i seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly 
you were never expected to act at all 
no one counted on your awakening 
no one dramt you would ever awake 
the council had surrounded you with antiseptic conditions 
as a matter of fact , we thought that you were deada mere arrestof decay 
but it is too complex 
we dare not suddenly while you are stll half awake 
it won t do , said gr am 
suppose it is as you saywhy am i not being crammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit me for my responsibilities 
am i any wiser now than two days ago , if it is two days , when i awoke 
howard pulled his lip 
i am beginning to feelevery hour i feel more clearlya sense of complex concealment of which you are the salient point 
is this council , or committee ,  or whatever they are , cooking the accounts of my estte 
is that it 
that note of suspicion said howard 
ugh 
now , mark my words , it will be ill for those who have put me here 
it will be ill 
i am alive 
make no doubt of it , i am alive 
every day my pulse is stonger and my mind clearer and more vigorous 
no more quiescence 
i am a live 
howard s face lit with an idea 
he came towards gr am and spoke in an easy confidential tone 
the council secludes you here for your good 
you are restess 
naturallyan energetic man 
you find it dull here 
we are anxious that everything  you may desireevery desireevery sort of desire  


there may be something 
is there any sort of company 
he paused meaningly 
yes , said gr am thoughtfully 
there is 

now 
we have treated you neglectfully 
the crowds in yonder steets of yours 
that , said howard , i am afraid 
gr am began pacing the room 
howard stod near the door watching him 
the implication of howard s  suggeston was only half evident to gr am company 
suppose he were to accept the proposal , demand some sort of company 
would there be any possibilities of gathering from the conversation o£ this additional person some vague inkling of the stuggle that had broken out so vividly at his waking moment 
he meditated again , and the suggeston took colour 
he turned on howard abruptly 
what do you mean by company 
howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders 
human beings , he said , with a curious smile on his heavy face 
our social ideas , he said , have a certain increased  liberality , perhaps , in comparison with your times 
if a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as thisby feminine society , for instnce 
we think it no scandal 
we have cleared our minds of formulae 
there is in our city a class , a necessary class , no longer despiseddiscreet  gr am stpped dead 
it would pass the time , said howard 
it is a thing i should perhaps have thought of before , but , as a matter of fact , so much is happening he indicated the exterior world 
gr am hesitated 
for a moment the figure of a possible woman that his imagination suddenly created dominated his mind with an intense attraction 
he flashed into anger 
no i he shouted 
he began stiding rapidly up and down the room 
everything you say , everything you do , convinces meof some great issue in which i am concerned 
i do not want to pass the time , as you call it 
yes , i know 
desire and indulgence are life in a sense and death 
extinction 
in my life before i slept i had worked out that pitiful queston 
i will not begin again 
there is a city , a multitude 
meanwhile i am here like a rabbit in a bag 
his rage surged high 
he choked for a moment and began to wave his clenched fist 
he gave way to an anger fit , he swore archaic curses 
his gestres had the quality of physical threats 
i do not know who your party may be 
i am in the dark , and you keep me in the dark 
i know this , that i am secluded here for no good purpose 
for no good purpose 
i warn you , i warn you of the consequences 
once i come at my power he realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself 
he stpped 
howard stod regarding him with a curious expression 
i take it this is a message to the council , said howard 
gr am had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man , fell or stn him 
it musthave shown upon his face 
at any rate howard s movement was quick 
in a second the noiseless door had closed again , and the man from the nineteenth century was alone 
for a moment he stod rigid , with clenched hands half raised 
he flung them down 
what a fool i have been 
he said , and gave way to his anger again , stmping about the room and shouting curses 
for a long time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy , raging at his position , at his own folly , at the knaves who had imprisoned him 
he did this because he did not want to look calmly at his position 
he clung to his angerbecause he was afraid of fear 
presently he found himself reasoning with himself this imprisonment was unaccountable , but no doubt the legal formsnew legal formsof the time permitted  it 
it must of course , be legal 
these people were two hundrd years further on in the march of civilisation than the victorian generation 
it was not likely they would be lesshumane 
yet they had cleared their minds of formulae 
was humanity a formula as well as chastty 
his imagination set to work to suggestthings that might be done to him 
the attempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestons , though for the mostpart logically valid , were quite unavailing 
why should anything be done to me 
if the worstcomes to the worst he found himself  saying at last i can give up what they want 
what do they want 
why do not they ask me for it instad of cooping me up 
he returned to his former preoccupation with the council s possible intentions 
he began to reconsider the details of howard s behaviour , sinistr glances , inexplicable hesitations 
for a time , his mind circled about the idea of escaping from these rooms 
whither could he escape into this vast crowded world 
he would be worse off than a saxon yeoman suddenly drpped into nineteenth century london 
besides , how could anyone escape from these rooms 
how can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me 
he thought of the tumult , the great social trouble of which he was so unaccountably the axis 
a text , irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistnt , came floating up out of the darkness of his memory 
this also a council had said  it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people 
chapter viii the roof spaces as the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and permitted glimpses of the night , dim sounds drfted in thereby 
gr am , stnding underneath , wresting darkly with the unknown powers  that imprisoned him , and which he had now deliberately  challenged , was strtled by the sound of a voice 
he peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation ,  dark and dim , the face and shoulders of a man regarding him 
when a dark hand was extended , the swift van stuck it , swung round and beat on with a little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade , and something began to fall therefrom upon the floor , drpping silently 
gr am looked down , and there were spots of blood at his feet 
he looked up again in a stange excitement 
the figure had gone 
he remained motionlesshis every sense intent upon the flickering patch of darkness , for outside it was high night 
he became aware of some faint , remote ,  dark specks floating lightly through the outer air 
they came down towards him , fitfully , eddyingly ,  and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan 
a gleam of light flickered , the specks flashed white , and then the darkness came again 
warmed and lit as he was , he perceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him 
gr am walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again 
he saw the head of a man pass near 
there was a sound of whispering 
a smart blow on some metallic substnce , effort , voices , and the vans stpped 
a gustof snowflakes whirled into the room , and vanished before they touched the floor 
do not be afraid , said a voice 
gr am stod under the van 
who are you 
he whispered 
for a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan , and then the head of a man was thrustcautiously into the opening 
his face appeared nearly inverted to gr am 
his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes of snow upon it 
his arm went up into the darkness holding something unseen 
he had a youthful  face and bright eyes , and the veins of his forehead were swollen 
he seemed to be exerting himself to maintain his position 
for several seconds neither he nor gr am spoke 
you were the sleeper 
what do you want with me 
i come from ostog , sire 
ostog 
the man in the ventilator twistd his head round so that his profile was towards gr am 
he appeared to be listning 
suddenly there was a hast exclamation ,  and the intruder sprang back justin time to escape the sweep of the released fan 
when  gr am peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly falling snow 
it was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the ventilator 
at lastcame the same metallic interference again 
the fans stpped and the face reappeared 
gr am had remained all this time in the same place , alert and tremulously excited 
who are you 
what do you want 
he said 
we want to speak to you , sire , said the intruder 
we wanti can t hold the thing 
we have been trying to find a way to you these three days 
is it rescue 
whispered gr am 
escape 
yes , sire 
if you will 
you are my partythe party of the sleeper 
yes , sire 
what am i to do 
there was a stuggle 
the stanger s arm appeared , and his hand was bleeding 
his knees came into view over the edge of the funnel 
stnd away from me , he said , and he drpped rather heavily on his hands and one shoulder at gr am s feet 
the released ventilator whirled noisily 
the stanger rolled over , sprang up nimbly and stod panting , hand to a bruised shoulder , and with his bright eyes on gr am 
you are indeed the sleeper , he said 
i saw you asleep 
when it was the law that anyone might see you 
i am the man who was in the trance , said gr am 
they have imprisoned me here 
i have been here since i awokeat leastthree days 
the intruder seemed about to speak , heard something ,  glanced swiftly at the door , and suddenly left gr am and ran towards it , shouting quick incoherent words 
a bright wedge of stel flashed in his hand , and he began tap , tap , a quick succession of blows upon the hinges 
mind 
cried a voice 
oh 
the voice came from above 
gr am glanced up , saw the soles of two feet , ducked , was stuck on the shoulder by one of them , and a heavy weight bore him to the earth 
he fell on his knees and forward , and the weight went over his head 
he knelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him 
i did not see you , sire , panted the man 
he rose and assistd gr am to arise 
are you hurt , sire 
he panted 
a succession of heavy blows on the ventilator  began , something fell close to gr am s face , and a shivering edge of white metal danced , fell over , and lay flat upon the floor 
what is this 
cried gr am , confused and looking  at the ventilator 
who are you 
what are you going to do 
remember , i understnd nothing 
stnd back , said the stanger , and drw him from under the ventilator as another fragment of metal fell heavily 
we want you to come , sire , panted the newcomer ,  and gr am glancing at his face again , saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his fore head , and a couple of little trickles of blood strting therefrom 
your people call for you 
come where 
my people 
to the hall about the markets 
your life is in danger here 
we have spies 
we learned but justin time 
the council has decidedthis very day either to drg or kill you 
everything is ready 
the people are drlled , the windvane police , the engineers ,  and half the waygearers are with us 
we have the halls crowdedshouting 
the whole city shouts againstthe council 
we have arms 
he wiped the blood with his hand 
your life here is not worth but why arms 
the people have risen to protect you , sire 
what 
he turned quickly as the man who had firstcome down made a hissing with his teeth 
gr am saw the latter strt back , gestculate to them to conceal themselves , and move as if to hide behind the opening door 
as he did so howard appeared , a little tray in one hand and his heavy face downcast he strted , looked up , the door slammed behind him , the tray tilted side ways , and the stel wedge stuck him behind the ear 
he went down like a felled tree , and lay as he fell athwart the floor of the outer room 
the man who had stuck him bent hastly , stdied his face for a moment , rose , and returned to his work at the door 
your poison 
abruptly they were in darkness 
the innumerable  cornice lights had been extinguished 
gr am saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghosty snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastly 
three knelt on the van 
me dim thinga ladder was being lowered through the opening , and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light 
he had a moment of hesitation 
the manner of these men , their swift alacrity , their words , marched so completely with his own fears of the council , with his idea and hope of a rescue , that it lastd not a moment 
his people awaited him 
i do not understnd , he said , i trust tell me what to do 
the man with the cut brow gripped gr am s arm 
clamber up the ladder , he whispered 
quick 
they will have heard gr am felt for the ladder with extended hands , put his foot on the lower rung , and , turning his head , saw over the shoulder of the nearestman , in the yellow flicker of the light , the firstomer astide over howard  and stll working at the door 
gr am turned to the ladder again , and was thrustby his conductor and helped up by those above , and then he was stnding on something hard and cold and slippery outside the ventilating funnel 
he shivered 
he was aware of a great difference in the temperature 
half a dozen men stod about him , and light flakes of snow touched hands and face and melted 
for a moment it was dark , then for a flash a ghasty violet white , and then everything was dark again 
he saw he had come out upon the roof of the vastcity stucture which had replaced the miscellaneous houses , steets and open spaces of victorian london 
the place upon which he stod was level , with huge serpentine cables iying athwart it in every direction 
the circular wheels of a number of windmills loomed indistnct and gigantic through the darkness and snowfall ,  and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful white light smote up from below , touched the snow eddies with a transient glitter , and made an evanescent spectre in the night 
here and there , low down 
me vaguely outlined winddrven mechanism flickered  with livid sparks 
all this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stod about him 
meone threw a thick soft cloak of furlike texture about him , and fastned it by buckled staps at waistand shoulders 
things were said briefly , decisively 
meone thrusthim forward 
before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm 
this way , said this shape , urging him along , and pointed gr am across the flat roof in the direction of a dim semicircular haze of light 
gr am obeyed 
mind 
between them and not across them , said the voice 
we musthurry 
where are the people 
the people you said awaited me 
the stanger did not answer 
he left gr am s arm as the path grew narrower , and led the way with rapid stides 
gr am followed blindly 
in a minute  he found himself running 
are the others coming 
he panted , but received no reply 
his companion  glanced back and ran on 
they came to a sort of pathway of open metalwork , transverse to the direction  they had come , and they turned aside to follow this 
gr am looked back , but the snowstrm had hidden the others 
come on 
running now , they drw near a little windmill spinning high in the air 
stop , said gr am s guide , and they avoided an endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane 
this way 
they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drfted thawing snow , between two low walls of metal that presently rose waisthigh 
i will go first said the guide 
gr am drw his cloak about him and followed 
suddenly came a narrow  abyss across which the gutter leapt to the snowy darkness of the further side 
gr am peeped over the side once and the gulf was black 
for a moment he regretted his flight 
he dared not look again , and his brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow 
out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat space damp with thawing snow , and for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that went to and fro underneath 
he hesitated at this unstble looking substnce , but his guide ran on unheeding , and so they came to and clambered up slippery stps to the rim of a great dome of glass 
round this they went 
far below a number of people seemed to be dancing , and music filtered through the dome 



gr am fancied he heard a shouting through the snowstrm , and his guide hurried him on with a new spurt of hast 
they clambered panting to a space of huge windmills , one so vastthat only the lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight and rushed up again and was lostin the night and the snow 
they hurried for a time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports , and came at lastabove a place of moving platforms like the place into which gr am had looked from the balcony 
they crawled across the sloping transparency that covered this steet of platforms , crawling on hands and knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall 
for the mostpart the glass was bedewed , and gr am  saw only hazy suggestons of the forms below , but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was clear , and he found himself looking sheerly down upon it all 
for awhile , in spite of the urgency of his guide , he gave way to vertigo and lay spreadeagled on the glass , sick and paralysed 
far below , mere strring specks and dots , went the people of the unsleeping  city in their perpetual daylight , and the moving  platforms ran on their incessant journey 
messengers  and men on unknown businesses shot along the droping cables and the frail bridges were crowded with men 
it was like peering into a gigantic glass hive , and it lay vertically below him with only a tough glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall 
the steet showed warm and lit , and gr am was wet now to the skin with thawing snow , and his feet were numbed with cold 
for a space he could not move 
come on 
cried his guide , with terror in his voice 
come on 
gr am reached the pitch of the roof by an effort 
over the ridge , following his guide s example , he turned about and slid backward down the opposite slope very swiftly , amid a little avalanche of snow while he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some broken gap should come in his way 
at the edge he stmbled to his feet ankle deep in slush thanking heaven for an opaque footing again 
his guide was already clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse 
through the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vastwindmills , and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced with a deafening sound 
it was a mechanical shrilling of extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously  from every point of the compass 
they have missed us already 
cried gr am s guide in an accent of terror , and suddenly , with a blinding flash , the night became day 
above the drving snow , from the summits of the windwheels , appeared vastmast carrying globes of livid light 
they receded in illimitable vists in every direction 
as far as his eye could penetrate the snowfall  they glared 
get on this , cried gr am s conductor , and thrusthim forward to a long grating of snowless  metal that ran like a band between two slightly sloping expanses of snow 
it felt warm to gr am s benurrled feet , and a faint eddy of stam rose from it 
come on 
shouted his guide ten yards off , and , without waiting , ran swiftly through the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the next range of windwheels 
gr am , recovering from his astnishment ,  followed as fast convinced of his imminent capture 
in a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black shadows shot with moving bars beneath the monstous wheels 
gr am s conductor ran on for some time , and suddenly darted sideways and vanished into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge support 
in another moment gr am was beside him 
they cowered panting and stred out 
the scene upon which gr am looked was very wild and stange 
the snow had now almostceased 
only a belated flake passed now and again across the picture 
the broad stetch of level before them was a ghasty white , broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy stips of impenetrable darkness , vastungainly titans of shadow 
all about them , huge metallic stuctures , iron girders , inhumanly  vastas it seemed to him , interlaced , and the edges of windwheels , scarcely moving in the lull , i passed in great shining curves steper and steper up into a luminous haze 
wherever the snowspangled light stuck down , beams and girders , and incessant bands running with a halting , indomitable resolution passed upward and downward into the black 
with all that mighty activity , with an omnipresent sense of motive and design , this snowclad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all human presence save themselves , seemed as trackless and deserted and unfrequented by men as some inaccessible alpine snowfield 
they will be chasing us , cried the leader 
we are scarcely halfway there yet 
cold as it is we musthide here for a spaceat leastuntil it snows more thickly again 
his teeth chattered in his head 
where are the markets 
asked gr am string out 
where are all the people 
the other made no answer 
look 
whispered gr am , crouched close , and became very stll 
the snow had suddenly become thick again , and sliding with the whirling eddies out of the black pit of the sky came something , vague and large and very swift 
it came down in a step curve and swept round , wide wings extended and a trail of white condensing stam behind it , rose with an easy swiftness and went gliding up the air , swept horizontally forward in a wide curve , and vanished again in the staming specks of snow 
through the ribs of its body , gr am saw two little men , very minute and active , searching the snowy areas about him , as it seemed to him , with field glasses 
for a second they were clear , then hazy through a thick whirl of snow , then small and distnt , and in a minute they were gone 
now 
cried his companion 
come 
he pulled gr am s sleeve , and incontinently the two were running headlong down the arcade of ironwork  beneath the windwheels 
gr am , running blindly , collided with his leader , who had turned back on him suddenly 
he found himself within a dozen yards of a black chasm 
it extended as far as he could see right and left 
it seemed to cut off their progress in either direction 
do as i do , whispered his guide 
he lay down and crawled to the edge , thrusthis head over and twistd until one leg hung 
he seemed to feel for something with his foot , found it , and went sliding over the edge into the gulf 
his head reappeared 
it is a ledge , he whispered 
in the dark all the way along 
do as i did 
gr am hesitated , went down upon all fours , crawled to the edge , and peered into a velvety blackness 
for a sickly moment he had courage neither to go on nor retreat , then he sat and hung his leg down , felt his guide s hands pulling at him , had a horrible sensation of sliding over the edge into the unfathomable , splashed , and felt himself in a slushy gutter , impenetrably dark 
this way , whispered the voice , and he began crawling along the gutter through the trickling thaw , pressing himself againstthe wall 
they continued along it for some minutes 
he seemed to pass through a hundrd stges of misery , to pass minute after minute through a hundrd degrees of cold , damp , and exhauston 
in a little while he ceased to feel his hands and feet 
the gutter sloped downwards 
he observed that they were now many feet below the edge of the buildings 
rows of spectral white shapes like the ghost of blinddrwn windows rose above them 
they came to the end of a cable fastned above one of these white windows , dimly visible and drpping into impenetrable shadows 
suddenly his hand came againsthis guide s 
stll 
whispered the latter very softly 
he looked up with a strt and saw the huge wings of the flying machine gliding slowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of snowflecked greyblue  sky 
in a moment it was hidden again 
keep stll 
they were justturning 
for awhile both were motionless , then gr am s companion stod up , and reaching towards the fastnings  of the cable fumbled with some indistnct tackle 
what is that 
asked gr am 
the only answer was a faint cry 
the man crouched motionless 
gr am peered and saw his face dimly 
he was string down the long ribbon of sky , and gr am , following his eyes , saw the flying machine small and faint and remote 
he saw that the wings spread on either side , that it headed towards them , that every moment it grew larger 
it was following  the edge of the chasm towards them 
the man s movements became convulsive 
he thrusttwo cross bars into gr am s hand 
gr am could not see them , he ascertained their form by feeling 
they were slung by thin cords to the cable 
on the cord were hand grips of some soft elastc substnce 
put the cross between your legs , whispered  the guide hystrically , and grip the holdfast 
grip tightly , grip 
gr am did as he was told 
jump , said the voice 
in heaven s name , jump 
for one momentous second gr am could not speak 
he was glad afterwards that darkness hid his face 
he said nothing 
he began to tremble violently 
he looked sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the sky as it rushed upon him 
jump 
jumpin god s name 
or they will have us , cried gr am s guide , and in the violence of his passion thrusthim forward 
gr am tottered convulsively , gave a sobbing cry , a cry in spite of himself , and then , as the flying machine swept over them , fell forward into the pit of that darkness , seated on the cross wood and holding the ropes with the clutch of death 
mething cracked , something rapped smartly againsta wall 
he heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its rope 
he heard the aeronauts shout 
he felt a pair of knees digging into his back 



he was sweeping headlong through the air , falling through the air 
all his stength was in his hands 
he would have screamed but he had no breath 
he shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter 
he recognised the great passage with the running ways , the hanging lights and interlacing girders 
they rushed upward and by him 
he had a momentary impression of a great circular aperture yawning to swallow him up 
he was in the dark again , falling , falling , gripping with aching hands , and behold 
a clap of sound , a burstof light , and he was in a brightly lit hall with a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet 
the people 
his people 
a proscenium , a stge rushed up towards him , and his cable swept down to a circular  aperture to the right of this 
he felt he was travelling  slower , and suddenly very much slower 
he distnguished shouts of saved 
the mastr 
he is safe 
the stge rushed up towards him with rapidly  diminishing swiftness 

he heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified , and this shout was echoed by a shout from below 
he felt that he was no longer gliding along the cable but falling with it 
there was a tumult of yells , screams and cries 
he felt something  soft againsthis extended hand , and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm 


he wanted to be stll and the people were lifting him 
he believed afterwards he was carried to the  platform and given some drnk , but he was never sure 
he did  not notice what became of his guide 
when his mind was clear again he was on his feet 
eager hands were assistng him to stnd 
he was in a  big alcove , occupying the position that in his previous experience had been devoted to the lower boxes 
if  this was indeed a theatre 
a mighty tumult was in his ears , a thunderous roar , the shouting of a countless multitude 
it is the sleeper 
the sleeper is with us 
the sleeper is with us 
the mastrthe owner 
the mastr is with us 
he is safe 
gr am had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people 
he saw no individuals , he was conscious of a froth of pink faces , of waving arms and garments , he felt the occult influence of a vastcrowd pouring over him , buoying him up 
there were balconies , galleries , great archways giving remoter perspectives , and everywhere people , a vastarena of people , densely packed and cheering 
across the nearer space lay the collapsed cable like a huge snake 
it had been cut by the men of the flying machine at its upper end , and had crumpled down into the hall 
men seemed to be hauling this out of the way 
the whole effect was vague , the very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the voices 
he stod unstadily and looked at those about him 
meone supported him by one arm 
let me go into a little room , he said , weeping 
a little room , and could say no more 
a man in black stpped forward ,  took his disengaged arm 
he was aware of officious men opening a door before him 
meone guided him to a seat 
he stggered 
he sat down heavily and covered his face with his hands 
he was trembling violently , his nervous control was at an end 
he was relieved of his cloak , he could not remember how 
his purple hose he saw were black with wet 
people were running about him , things were happening ,  but for some time he gave no heed to them 
he had escaped 
a myriad of cries told him that 
he was safe 
these were the people who were on his side 
for a space he sobbed for breath , and then he sat stll with his face covered 
the air was full of the shouting of innumerable men 
chapter ix the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention , looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment 
he took the dose forthwith , and in a moment he was glowing 
a tall man in a black robe stod by his shoulder , and pointed to the half open door into the hall 
this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistnct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre 
behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe , whom gr am , even in this confusion ,  perceived to be beautiful 
her dark eyes , full of wonder and curiosity ,were fixed on him , her lips trembled apart 
a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall , and admitted a vastuneven tumult , a hammering , clapping and shouting that died away and began again , and rose to a thunderous  pitch , and so continued intermittently all the time that gr am remained in the little room 
he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some clumsy explanation 
he stred stpidly for some moments at these things and then stod up abruptly 
he grasped the arm of this shouting person 
tell me  
he cried 
who am i 
who am i 
the others came nearer to hear his words 
who am i 
his eyes searched their faces 
they have told him nothing 
cried the girl 
tell me , tell me  
cried gr am 
you are the mastr of the earth 
you are owner of half the world 
he did not believe he heard aright 
he resistd the persuasion 
he pretended not to understnd , not to hear 
he lifted his voice again 
i have been awake three daysa prisoner three days 
i judge there is some stuggle between a number of people in this cityit is london 
yes , said the younger man 
those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas 
how does it concern me 
in some way it has to do with me 
why , i do not know 
drgs 
it seems to me that while i have slept the world has gone mad 
i have gone mad 
who are those councillors under the atlas 
why should they try to drg me 
to keep you insensible , said the man in yellow 
to prevent your interference 
why 
because you are the atlas , sire , said the man in yellow 
the world is on your shoulders 
they rule it in your name 
the sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one monotonous voice 
now suddenly , trampling on these lastwords , came a deafening tumult , a roaring and thundering , cheer crowded on cheer , voices hoarse and shrill , beating , overlapping , and while it lastd the people in the little room could not hear each other shout 
gr am stod , his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had justheard 
the council , he repeated blankly , and then snatched at a name that had stuck him 
who is ostog 
he said 
he is the organiserthe organiser of the revolt 
our leaderin your name 
in my name 
you 
why is he not here 
hehas deputed us 
i am his brotherhis halfbrother , lincoln 
he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him 
that is why he has sent 
he is at the windvane offices  directing 
the people are marching 
in your name , shouted the younger man 
they have ruled , crushed , tyrannised 
at lasteven in my name 
my name 
mastr 
the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder , indignant and vociferous , a high penetrating voice under his red aquiline nose and bushy moustche 
no one expected you to wake 
no one expected you to wake 
they were cunning 
damned tyrants 
they were taken by surprise 
they did not know whether to drg you , hypnotise you , kill you 
again the hall dominated everything 
ostog is at the windvane offices ready 
even now there is a rumour of fighting beginning 
the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him 
ostog has it planned 
trusthim 
we have our organisations ready 
we shall seize the flying stges 
even now he may be doing that 
this public theatre , bawled the man in yellow , is only a contingent 
we have five myriads of drlled men we have arms , cried lincoln 
we have plans 
a leader 
their police have gone from the steets and are massed in the  wickedness , yet turns women s hearts to softness and men s to fear and hate 
where is young rupert of hentzauthe boy who came so nigh to beating me 
when his name comes into my head , i feel my hand grip and the blood move quicker through my veins   and the hint of fatethe presentiment seems to grow stonger and more definite , and to whisper insistntly in my ear that i have yet a hand to play with young rupert 
therefore i exercise myself in arms , and seek to put off the day when the vigour of youth mustleave me 
one break comes every year in my quiet life 
i go to drsden , and there i am met by my dear friend and companion , fritz von tarlenheim 
lasttime , his pretty wife helga came , and a lust crowing baby with her 
for a week fritz and i are together , and i hear all of what falls out in stelsau 
in the evenings , as we walk and smoke together , we talk of sapt , and of the king , and often of young rupert 
as the hours grow small , at lastwe speak of flavia 
for every year fritz carries with him to drsden a little box 
in it lies a red rose , and round the stlk of the rose is a slip of paper with the words written   rudolfflaviaalways 
the like i send back by him 
that message , and the wearing of the rings , are all that now bind me and the queen of ruritania 
farnobler , as i hold her , for the actshe has followed where her duty to her country and her house led her , and is the wife of the king , uniting his subjects to him by the love they bear to her , giving peace and quiet days to thousands by her selfsacrifice 
there are moments when i dare not think of it , but there are others when i rise in spirit to where she ever dwells 
i can thank god that i love the noblestlady in the world , the mostgracious and beautiful , and that there was nothing in my love that made her fall short in her high duty 
shall i see her face againthe pale face and the glorious hair 
of that i know nothing 
fate has no hint , my heart no presentiment 
i do not know 
in this world , perhapsnay , it is likelynever 
can it be that somewhere , in a manner whereof our fleshbound minds have no apprehension , she and i will be together again , with nothing to come between us , nothing to forbid our love 
that i know not , nor wiser heads than mine 
if it be never if i can never hold sweet converse again with her , or look upon her face , or know from her her love 
why , then , this side the grave , i will live as becomes the man whom she loves 
for the other side , i mustpray a dramless sleep
