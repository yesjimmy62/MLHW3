<s>  having no more children, however, he proposed to the barons to swear that they would recognise as his successor, his daughter matilda, whom, as she was now a widow, he married to the eldest son of the count of anjou, geoffrey, surnamed plantagenet, from a custom he had of wearing a sprig of flowering broom (called genˆt in french) in his cap for a feather. </s>
<s>  as one false man usually makes many, and as a false king, in particular, is pretty certain to make a false court, the barons took the oath about the succession of matilda , edward soon recovered and was sound again. </s>
<s>  as the king his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, he now began the journey. </s>
<s>  he had got as far as italy, when he met messengers who brought him intelligence of the king's death. </s>
<s>   hearing that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to his own dominions, but paid a visit to the pope, and went in state through various italian towns, where he was welcomed with acclamations as a mighty champion of the cross from the holy l and where he received presents of purple mantles and prancing horses, and went along in great triumph. </s>
<s>  the shouting people little knew that he was the last english monarch who would ever embark in a crusade, or that within twenty years every conquest which the christians had made in the holy land at the cost of so much blood, would be won back by the turks. </s>
<s>  but all this came to pass. </s>
<s>  there was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in france, called chƒlons. </s>
<s>  when the king was coming towards this place on his way to engl a wily french lord, called the count of chƒlons, sent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a fair tournament with the count and his knights, and make a day of it with sword and lance. </s>
<s>  it was represented to the king that the count of chƒlons was not to be trusted, and that, instead of a holiday fight for mere show and in good humour, he secretly meant a real battle, in which the english should be defeated by superior force. </s>
<s>  the king, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on the appointed day with a thousand followers. </s>
<s>  when the count came with two thousand and attacked the english in earnest, the english rushed at them with such valour that the count's men and the count's horses soon began to be tumbled down all over the field. </s>
<s>   the count himself seized the king round the neck, but the king tumbled him out of his saddle in return for the compliment,  jumping from his own horse, and standing over him, beat away at his iron armour like a blacksmith hammering on his anvil. </s>
<s>  even when the count owned himself defeated and offered his sword, the king would not do him the honour to take it, but made him yield it up to a common soldier. </s>
<s>  there had been such fury shown in this fight, that it was afterwards called the little battle of chƒlons. </s>
<s>  the english were very well disposed to be proud of their king after these adventures. </s>
<s>  so, when he landed at dover in the year one thousand two hundred and seventy-four , on very difficult and heavy ground. </s>
<s>  and he knew that when they moved, there must be confusion among them. </s>
<s>  as they did not move, he sent off two parties:- one to lie concealed in a wood on the left of the french: the other, to set fire to some houses behind the french after the battle should be begun. </s>
<s>  this was scarcely done, when three of the proud french gentlemen, who were to defend their country without any help from the base peasants, came riding out, calling upon the english to surrender. </s>
<s>  the king warned those gentlemen himself to retire with all speed if they cared for their lives, and ordered the english banners to advance. </s>
<s>  upon that, sir thomas erpingham, a great english general, who commanded the archers, threw his truncheon into the air, joyfully, and all the english men, kneeling down upon the ground and biting it as if they took possession of the country, rose up with a great shout and fell upon the french. </s>
<s>  every archer was furnished with a great stake tipped with iron. </s>
<s>  and his orders were, to thrust this stake into the ground, to discharge his arrow, and then to fall back, when the french horsemen came on. </s>
<s>   as the haughty french gentlemen, who were to break the english archers and utterly destroy them with their knightly lances, came riding up, they were received with such a blinding storm of arrows, that they broke and turned. </s>
<s>  horses and men rolled over one another, and the confusion was terrific. </s>
<s>  those who rallied and charged the archers got among the stakes on slippery and boggy ground, and were so bewildered that the english archers - who wore no armour, and even took off their leathern coats to be more active - cut them to pieces, root and branch. </s>
<s>  only three french horsemen got within the stakes, and those were instantly despatched. </s>
<s>  all this time the dense french army, being in armour, were sinking knee-deep into the mire. </s>
<s>  while the light english archers, half- naked, were as fresh and active as if they were fighting on a marble floor. </s>
<s>  but now, the second division of the french coming to the relief of the first, closed up in a firm mass. </s>
<s>  the english, headed by the king, attacked them. </s>
<s>  and the deadliest part of the battle began. </s>
<s>   the king's brother, the duke of clarence, was struck down, and numbers of the french surrounded him. </s>
<s>   king henry, standing over the body, fought like a lion until they were beaten off. </s>
<s>  presently, came up a band of eighteen french knights, bearing the banner of a certain french lord, who had sworn to kill or take the english king. </s>
<s>  one of them struck him such a blow with a battle-axe that he reeled and fell upon his knees. </s>
<s>   his faithful men, immediately closing round him, killed every one of those eighteen knights, and so that french lord never kept his oath. </s>
<s>  the french duke of alen‡on, seeing this, made a desperate charge, and cut his way close up to the royal standard of england. </s>
<s>  he beat down the duke of york, who was standing near it. </s>
<s>   when the king came to his rescue, struck off a piece of the crown he wore. </s>
<s>   he never struck another blow in this world. </s>
<s>  for, even as he was in the act of saying who he was, and that he surrendered to the king. </s>
<s>  and even as the king stretched out his hand to give him a safe and honourable acceptance of the offer. </s>
<s>  he fell dead, pierced by innumerable wounds. </s>
<s>  the death of this nobleman decided the battle. </s>
<s>  the third division of the french army, which had never struck a blow yet, and which was, in itself, more than double the whole english power, broke and fled. </s>
<s>  at this time of the fight, the english, who as yet had made no prisoners, began to take them in immense numbers, and were still occupied in doing so, or in killing those who would not surrender, when a great noise arose in the rear of the french - their flying banners were seen to stop - and king henry, supposing a great reinforcement to have arrived, gave orders that all the prisoners should be put to death. </s>
<s>  as soon, however, as it was found that the noise was only occasioned by a body of plundering peasants, the terrible massacre was stopped. </s>
<s>  then king henry called to him the french herald, and asked him to whom the victory belonged. </s>
<s>  the herald replied, 'to the king of england. </s>
<s> we have not made this havoc and slaughter,' said the king. </s>
<s>  'it is the wrath of heaven on the sins of france. </s>
<s>  what is the name of that castle yonder?' the herald answered him, 'my lord, it is the castle of azincourt. </s>
<s> '  said the king, 'from henceforth this battle shall be known to posterity, by the name of the battle of azincourt. </s>
<s> ' our english historians have made it agincourt. </s>
<s>   under that name, it will ever be famous in english annals. </s>
<s>  the loss upon the french side was enormous. </s>
<s>  three dukes were killed, two more were taken prisoners, seven counts were killed, three more were taken prisoners, and ten thousand knights and gentlemen were slain upon the field. </s>
<s>  the english loss amounted to sixteen hundred men, among whom were the duke of york and the earl of suffolk. </s>
<s>  war is a dreadful thing. </s>
<s>  and it is appalling to know how the english were obliged, next morning, to kill those prisoners mortally wounded, who yet writhed in agony upon the ground. </s>
<s>  how the dead upon the french side were stripped by their own countrymen and countrywomen, and afterwards buried in great pits. </s>
<s>  how the dead upon the english side were piled up in a great barn, and how their bodies and the barn were all burned together. </s>
<s>  it is in such things, and in many more much too horrible to relate, that the real desolation and wickedness of war consist. </s>
<s>  nothing can make war otherwise than horrible. </s>
<s>  but the dark side of it was little thought of and soon forgotten. </s>
<s>  and it cast no shade of trouble on the english people, except on those who had lost friends or relations in the fight. </s>
<s>  they welcomed their king home with shouts of rejoicing, and plunged into the water to bear him ashore on their shoulders, and flocked out in crowds to welcome him in every town through which he passed, and hung rich carpets and tapestries out of the windows, and strewed the streets with flowers, and made the fountains run with wine, as the great field of agincourt had run with blood. </s>
<s>  second part that proud and wicked french nobility who dragged their country to destruction, and who were every day and every year regarded with deeper hatred and detestation in the hearts of the french people, learnt nothing, even from the defeat of agincourt. </s>
<s>  so far from uniting against the common enemy, they became, among themselves, more violent, more bloody, and more false - if that were possible - than they had been before. </s>
<s>  the count of armagnac persuaded the french king to plunder of her treasures queen isabella of bavaria, and to make her a prisoner. </s>
<s>  she, who had hitherto been the bitter enemy of the duke of burgundy, proposed to join him, in revenge. </s>
<s>   he carried her off to troyes, where she proclaimed herself regent of france, and made him her lieutenant. </s>
<s>  the armagnac party were at that time possessed of paris. </s>
<s>   one of the gates of the city being secretly opened on a certain night to a party of the duke's men, they got into paris, threw into the prisons all the armagnacs upon whom they could lay their hands,  a few nights afterwards, with the aid of a furious mob of sixty thousand people, broke the prisons open, and killed them all. </s>
<s>  the former dauphin was now dead, and the king's third son bore the title. </s>
<s>  him, in the height of this murderous scene, a french knight hurried out of bed, wrapped in a sheet, and bore away to poitiers. </s>
<s>  so, when the revengeful isabella and the duke of burgundy entered paris in triumph after the slaughter of their enemies, the dauphin was proclaimed at poitiers as the real regent. </s>
<s>  king henry had not been idle since his victory of agincourt, but had repulsed a brave attempt of the french to recover harfleur. </s>
<s>  had gradually conquered a great part of normandy. </s>
<s>   at this crisis of affairs, took the important town of rouen, after a siege of half a year. </s>
<s>  this great loss so alarmed the french, that the duke of burgundy proposed that a meeting to treat of peace should be held between the french and the english kings in a plain by the river seine. </s>
<s>  on the appointed day, king henry appeared there, with his two brothers, clarence and gloucester, and a thousand men. </s>
<s>  the unfortunate french king, being more mad than usual that day, could not come. </s>
<s>  but the queen came, and with her the princess catherine:  who was a very lovely creature, and who made a real impression on king henry, now that he saw her for the first time. </s>
<s>  this was the most important circumstance that arose out of the meeting. </s>
<s>  as if it were impossible for a french nobleman of that time to be true to his word of honour in anything, henry discovered that the duke of burgundy was, at that very moment, in secret treaty with the dauphin. </s>
<s>  and he therefore abandoned the negotiation. </s>
<s>  the duke of burgundy and the dauphin, each of whom with the best reason distrusted the other as a noble ruffian surrounded by a party of noble ruffians, were rather at a loss how to proceed after this. </s>
<s>   at length they agreed to meet, on a bridge over the river yonne, where it was arranged that there should be two strong gates put up, with an empty space between them. </s>
<s>  and that the duke of burgundy should come into that space by one gate, with ten men only. </s>
<s>  and that the dauphin should come into that space by the other gate, also with ten men, and no more. </s>
<s>  so far the dauphin kept his word, but no farther. </s>
<s>  when the duke of burgundy was on his knee before him in the act of speaking, one of the dauphin's noble ruffians cut the said duke down with a small axe, and others speedily finished him. </s>
<s>  it was in vain for the dauphin to pretend that this base murder was not done with his consent. </s>
<s>  it was too bad, even for france, and caused a general horror. </s>
<s>  the duke's heir hastened to make a treaty with king henry, and the french queen engaged that her husband should consent to it, whatever it was. </s>
<s>  henry made peace, on condition of receiving the princess catherine in marriage, and being made regent of france during the rest of the king's lifetime, and succeeding to the french crown at his death. </s>
<s>  he was soon married to the beautiful princess, and took her proudly home to engl where she was crowned with great honour and glory. </s>
<s>  this peace was called the perpetual peace. </s>
<s>  we shall soon see how long it lasted. </s>
<s>  it gave great satisfaction to the french people, although they were so poor and miserable, that, at the time of the celebration of the royal marriage, numbers of them were dying with starvation, on the dunghills in the streets of paris. </s>
<s>  there was some resistance on the part of the dauphin in some few parts of france, but king henry beat it all down. </s>
<s>  and now, with his great possessions in france secured, and his beautiful wife to cheer him, and a son born to give him greater happiness, all appeared bright before him. </s>
<s>   in the fulness of his triumph and the height of his power, death came upon him, and his day was done. </s>
<s>  when he fell ill at vincennes, and found that he could not recover, he was very calm and quiet, and spoke serenely to those who wept around his bed. </s>
<s>  his wife and child, he said, he left to the loving care of his brother the duke of bedford, and his other faithful nobles. </s>
<s>  he gave them his advice that england should establish a friendship with the new duke of burgundy, and offer him the regency of france. </s>
<s>  that it should not set free the royal princes who had been taken at agincourt. </s>
<s>  and that, whatever quarrel might arise with france, england should never make peace without holding normandy. </s>
<s>  then, he laid down his head, and asked the attendant priests to chant the penitential psalms. </s>
<s>  amid which solemn sounds, on the thirty-first of august, one thousand four hundred and twenty-two, in only the thirty-fourth year of his age and the tenth of his reign, king henry the fifth passed away. </s>
<s>  slowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body in a procession of great state to paris, and thence to rouen where his queen was: from whom the sad intelligence of his death was concealed until he had been dead some days. </s>
<s>  thence, lying on a bed of crimson and gold, with a golden crown upon the head, and a golden ball and sceptre lying in the nerveless hands, they carried it to calais, with such a great retinue as seemed to dye the road black. </s>
<s>  the king of scotland acted as chief mourner, all the royal household followed, the knights wore black armour and black plumes of feathers, crowds of men bore torches, making the night as light as day. </s>
<s>  and the widowed princess followed last of all. </s>
<s>  at calais there was a fleet of ships to bring the funeral host to dover. </s>
<s>  and so, by way of london bridge, where the service for the dead was chanted as it passed along, they brought the body to westminster abbey, and there buried it with great respect. </s>
<s>  chapter xxii - england under henry the sixth part the first it had been the wish of the late king, that while his infant son king henry the sixth, at this time only nine months old, was under age, the duke of gloucester should be appointed regent. </s>
<s>  the english parliament, however, preferred to appoint a council of regency, with the duke of bedford at its head: to be represented, in his absence only, by the duke of gloucester. </s>
<s>  the parliament would seem to have been wise in this, for gloucester soon showed himself to be ambitious and troublesome,  in the gratification of his own personal schemes, gave dangerous offence to the duke of burgundy, which was with difficulty adjusted. </s>
<s>  as that duke declined the regency of france, it was bestowed by the poor french king upon the duke of bedford. </s>
<s>   the french king dying within two months, the dauphin instantly asserted his claim to the french throne, and was actually crowned under the title of charles the seventh. </s>
<s>  the duke of bedford, to be a match for him, entered into a friendly league with the dukes of burgundy and brittany, and gave them his two sisters in marriage. </s>
<s>  war with france was immediately renewed, and the perpetual peace came to an untimely end. </s>
<s>  in the first campaign, the english, aided by this alliance, were speedily successful. </s>
<s>  as scotl however, had sent the french five thousand men, and might send more, or attack the north of england while england was busy with france, it was considered that it would be a good thing to offer the scottish king, james, who had been so long imprisoned, his liberty, on his paying forty thousand pounds for his board and lodging during nineteen years, and engaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the flag of france. </s>
<s>  it is pleasant to know, not only that the amiable captive at last regained his freedom upon these terms,  that he married a noble english lady, with whom he had been long in love, and became an excellent king. </s>
<s>  i am afraid we have met with some kings in this history, and shall meet with some more, who would have been very much the better, and would have left the world much happier, if they had been imprisoned nineteen years too. </s>
<s>  in the second campaign, the english gained a considerable victory at verneuil, in a battle which was chiefly remarkable, otherwise, for their resorting to the odd expedient of tying their baggage- horses together by the heads and tails, and jumbling them up with the baggage, so as to convert them into a sort of live fortification - which was found useful to the troops, but which i should think was not agreeable to the horses. </s>
<s>  for three years afterwards very little was done, owing to both sides being too poor for war, which is a very expensive entertainment. </s>
<s>   a council was then held in paris, in which it was decided to lay siege to the town of orleans, which was a place of great importance to the dauphin's cause. </s>
<s>  an english army of ten thousand men was despatched on this service, under the command of the earl of salisbury, a general of fame. </s>
<s>  he being unfortunately killed early in the siege, the earl of suffolk took his place. </s>
<s>  under whom  contradictory and confused, so that now they said one thing, and now said another, and the maid lost credit every day. </s>
<s>  charles marched on paris, which was opposed to him, and attacked the suburb of saint honore. </s>
<s>   in this fight, being again struck down into the ditch, she was abandoned by the whole army. </s>
<s>  she lay unaided among a heap of dead, and crawled out how she could. </s>
<s>  then, some of her believers went over to an opposition maid, catherine of la rochelle, who said she was inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried money - though she never did - and then joan accidentally broke the old, old sword, and others said that her power was broken with it. </s>
<s>   finally, at the siege of compiŠgne, held by the duke of burgundy, where she did valiant service, she was basely left alone in a retreat, though facing about and fighting to the last. </s>
<s>  and an archer pulled her off her horse. </s>
<s>  o the uproar that was made, and the thanksgivings that were sung, about the capture of this one poor country-girl! o the way in which she was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy, and anything else you like, by the inquisitor-general of france, and by this great man, and by that great man, until it is wearisome to think of! she was bought at last by the bishop of beauvais for ten thousand francs, and was shut up in her narrow prison: plain joan of arc again, and maid of orleans no more. </s>
<s>  i should never have done if i were to tell you how they had joan out to examine her, and cross-examine her, and re-examine her, and worry her into saying anything and everything. </s>
<s>  and how all sorts of scholars and doctors bestowed their utmost tediousness upon her. </s>
<s>   sixteen times she was brought out and shut up again, and worried, and entrapped, and argued with, until she was heart-sick of the dreary business. </s>
<s>  on the last occasion of this kind she was brought into a burial-place at rouen, dismally decorated with a scaffold, and a stake and faggots, and the executioner, and a pulpit with a friar therein, and an awful sermon ready. </s>
<s>  it is very affecting to know that even at that pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin of a king, who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned her. </s>
<s>   that while she had been regardless of reproaches heaped upon herself, she spoke out courageously for him. </s>
<s>  it was natural in one so young to hold to life. </s>
<s>  to save her life, she signed a declaration prepared for her - signed it with a cross, for she couldn't write - that all her visions and voices had come from the devil. </s>
<s>  upon her recanting the past, and protesting that she would never wear a man's dress in future, she was condemned to imprisonment for life, 'on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction. </s>
<s> '  on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction, the visions and the voices soon returned. </s>
<s>  it was quite natural that they should do so, for that kind of disease is much aggravated by fasting, loneliness, and anxiety of mind. </s>
<s>  it was not only got out of joan that she considered herself inspired again,  she was taken in a man's dress, which had been left - to entrap her - in her prison, and which she put on, in her solitude. </s>
<s>  perhaps, in remembrance of her past glories, perhaps, because the imaginary voices told her. </s>
<s>  for this relapse into the sorcery and heresy and anything else you like, she was sentenced to be burnt to death. </s>
<s>    in the market-place of rouen, in the hideous dress which the monks had invented for such spectacles. </s>
<s>  with priests and bishops sitting in a gallery looking on, though some had the christian grace to go away, unable to endure the infamous scene. </s>
<s>  this shrieking girl - last seen amidst the smoke and fire, holding a crucifix between her hands. </s>
<s>  last heard, calling upon christ - was burnt to ashes. </s>
<s>  they threw her ashes into the river seine. </s>
<s>  but they will rise against her murderers on the last day. </s>
<s>  from the moment of her capture, neither the french king nor one single man in all his court raised a finger to save her. </s>
<s>  it is no defence of them that they may have never really believed in her, or that they may have won her victories by their skill and bravery. </s>
<s>   the more they pretended to believe in her, the more they had caused her to believe in herself. </s>
<s>  and she had ever been true to them, ever brave, ever nobly devoted. </s>
<s>   it is no wonder, that they, who were in all things false to themselves, false to one another, false to their country, false to heaven, false to earth, should be monsters of ingratitude and treachery to a helpless peasant girl. </s>
<s>  in the picturesque old town of rouen, where weeds and grass grow high on the cathedral towers, and the venerable norman streets are still warm in the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires that once gleamed horribly upon them have long grown cold, there is a statue of joan of arc, in the scene of her last agony, the square to which she has given its present name. </s>
<s>  i know some statues of modern times - even in the world's metropolis, i think - which commemorate less constancy, less earnestness, smaller claims upon the world's attention, and much greater impostors. </s>
<s>  part the third bad deeds seldom prosper, happily for mankind. </s>
<s>  and the english cause gained no advantage from the cruel death of joan of arc. </s>
<s>  for a long time, the war went heavily on. </s>
<s>  the duke of bedford died. </s>
<s>  the alliance with the duke of burgundy was broken. </s>
<s>  and lord talbot became a great general on the english side in france. </s>
<s>   two of the consequences of wars are, famine - because the people cannot peacefully cultivate the ground - and pestilence, which comes of want, misery, and suffering. </s>
<s>  both these horrors broke out in both countries, and lasted for two wretched years. </s>
<s>  then, the war went on again, and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the english government, that, within twenty years from the execution of the maid of orleans, of all the great french conquests, the town of calais alone remained in english hands. </s>
<s>  while these victories and defeats were taking place in the course of time, many strange things happened at home. </s>
<s>  the young king, as he grew up, proved to be very unlike his great father, and showed himself a miserable puny creature. </s>
<s>  there was no harm in him - he had a great aversion to shedding blood: which was something -  he was a weak, silly, helpless young man, and a mere shuttlecock to the great lordly battledores about the court. </s>
<s>  of these battledores, cardinal beaufort, a relation of the king, and the duke of gloucester, were at first the most powerful. </s>
<s>  the duke of gloucester had a wife, who was nonsensically accused of practising witchcraft to cause the king's death and lead to her husband's coming to the throne, he being the next heir. </s>
<s>  she was charged with having, by the help of a ridiculous old woman named margery  were assembled together, for the purpose, as was represented to them, of doing honour to the marriage of their chief, the young king of navarre, with the sister of charles the ninth: a miserable young king who then occupied the french throne. </s>
<s>  this dull creature was made to believe by his mother and other fierce catholics about him that the huguenots meant to take his life. </s>
<s>  and he was persuaded to give secret orders that, on the tolling of a great bell, they should be fallen upon by an overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered wherever they could be found. </s>
<s>  when the appointed hour was close at h the stupid wretch, trembling from head to foot, was taken into a balcony by his mother to see the atrocious work begun. </s>
<s>  the moment the bell tolled, the murderers broke forth. </s>
<s>  during all that night and the two next days, they broke into the houses, fired the houses, shot and stabbed the protestants, men, women, and children, and flung their bodies into the streets. </s>
<s>  they were shot at in the streets as they passed along, and their blood ran down the gutters. </s>
<s>   upwards of ten thousand protestants were killed in paris alone. </s>
<s>  in all france four or five times that number. </s>
<s>  to return thanks to heaven for these diabolical murders, the pope and his train actually went in public procession at rome, and as if this were not shame enough for them, they had a medal struck to commemorate the event. </s>
<s>   however comfortable the wholesale murders were to these high authorities, they had not that soothing effect upon the doll-king. </s>
<s>  i am happy to state that he never knew a moment's peace afterwards. </s>
<s>  that he was continually crying out that he saw the huguenots covered with blood and wounds falling dead before him. </s>
<s>  and that he died within a year, shrieking and yelling and raving to that degree, that if all the popes who had ever lived had been rolled into one, they would not have afforded his guilty majesty the slightest consolation. </s>
<s>  when the terrible news of the massacre arrived in engl it made a powerful impression indeed upon the people. </s>
<s>  if they began to run a little wild against the catholics at about this time, this fearful reason for it, coming so soon after the days of bloody queen mary, must be remembered in their excuse. </s>
<s>  the court was not quite so honest as the people - but perhaps it sometimes is not. </s>
<s>   it received the french ambassador, with all the lords and ladies dressed in deep mourning, and keeping a profound silence. </s>
<s>   nevertheless, a proposal of marriage which he had made to elizabeth only two days before the eve of saint bartholomew, on behalf of the duke of alen‡on, the french king's brother, a boy of seventeen, still went on. </s>
<s>  while on the other h in her usual crafty way, the queen secretly supplied the huguenots with money and weapons. </s>
<s>  i must say that for a queen who made all those fine speeches, of which i have confessed myself to be rather tired, about living and dying a maiden queen, elizabeth was 'going' to be married pretty often. </s>
<s>  besides always having some english favourite or other whom she by turns encouraged and swore at and knocked about - for the maiden queen was very free with her fists - she held this french duke off and on through several years. </s>
<s>  when he at last came over to engl the marriage articles were actually drawn up, and it was settled that the wedding should take place in six weeks. </s>
<s>  the queen was then so bent upon it, that she prosecuted a poor puritan named stubbs, and a poor bookseller named page, for writing and publishing a pamphlet against it. </s>
<s>  their right hands were chopped off for this crime. </s>
<s>  and poor stubbs - more loyal than i should have been myself under the circumstances - immediately pulled off his hat with his left h and cried, 'god save the queen!' stubbs was cruelly treated. </s>
<s>  for the marriage never took place after all, though the queen pledged herself to the duke with a ring from her own finger. </s>
<s>  he went away, no better than he came, when the courtship had lasted some ten years altogether. </s>
<s>  and he died a couple of years afterwards, mourned by elizabeth, who appears to have been really fond of him. </s>
<s>  it is not much to her credit, for he was a bad enough member of a bad family. </s>
<s>  to return to the catholics. </s>
<s>  there arose two orders of priests, who were very busy in engl and who were much dreaded. </s>
<s>  these were the jesuits  outside the great hall, gawain and kay the seneschal and a great number of other lords were gathered. </s>
<s>  the seneschal was the first to espy those approaching, and said to my lord gawain: "sire, my heart divines that the vassal who yonder comes is he of whom the queen spoke as having yesterday done her such an insult. </s>
<s>  if i am not mistaken, there are three in the party, for i see the dwarf and the damsel. </s>
<s> " "that is so," says my lord gawain. </s>
<s>  "it is surely a damsel and a dwarf who are coming straight toward us with the knight. </s>
<s>  the knight himself is fully armed, but his shield is not whole. </s>
<s>  if the queen should see him, she would know him. </s>
<s>  hello, seneschal, go call her now!" so he went straightway and found her in one of the apartments. </s>
<s>  "my lady," says he, "do you remember the dwarf who yesterday angered you by wounding your damsel?" "yes, i remember him right well. </s>
<s>  seneschal, have you any news oœ him? why have you mentioned him?" "lady, because i have seen a knight-errant armed coming upon a grey horse, and if my eyes have not deceived me, i saw a damsel with him. </s>
<s>  and it seems to me that with him comes the dwarf, who still holds the scourge from which erec received his lashing. </s>
<s> " then the queen rose quickly and said: "let us go quickly, seneschal, to see if it is the vassal. </s>
<s>  if it is he, you may be sure that i shall tell you so, as soon as i see him. </s>
<s> " and kay said: "i will show him to you. </s>
<s>  come up into the bower where your knights are assembled. </s>
<s>  it was from there we saw him coming, and my lord gawain himself awaits you there. </s>
<s>  my lady, let us hasten thither, for here we have too long delayed. </s>
<s> " then the queen bestirred herself, and coming to the windows she took her stand by my lord gawain, and straightway recognised the knight. </s>
<s>  "ha! my lords," she cries, "it is he. </s>
<s>  he has been through great danger. </s>
<s>  he has been in a battle. </s>
<s>  i do not know whether erec has avenged his grief, or whether this knight has defeated erec. </s>
<s>  but there is many a dent upon his shield, and his hauberk is covered with blood, so that it is rather red than white. </s>
<s> " "in sooth, my lady," quoth my lord gawain, "i am very sure that you are quite right. </s>
<s>  his hauberk is covered with blood, and pounded and beaten, showing plainly that he has been in a fight. </s>
<s>  we can easily see that the battle has been hot. </s>
<s>  now we shall soon hear from him news that will give us joy or gloom: whether erec sends him to you here as a prisoner at your discretion, or whether he comes in pride of heart to boast before us arrogantly that he has defeated or killed erec. </s>
<s>  no other news can he bring, i think. </s>
<s> " the queen says: "i am of the same opinion. </s>
<s> " and all the others say: "it may well be so. </s>
<s> "  erec goes off at full speed down a road between two hedgerows--he and his wife with him. </s>
<s>  both putting spurs to their horses, they rode until they came to a meadow which had been mown. </s>
<s>  after emerging from the hedged enclosure they came upon a drawbridge before a high tower, which was all closed about with a wall and a broad and deep moat. </s>
<s>  they quickly pass over the bridge, but had not gone far before the lord of the place espied them from up in his tower. </s>
<s>  about this man i can tell you the truth: that he was very small oœ stature, but very courageous of heart. </s>
<s>  when he sees erec cross the bridge, he comes down quickly from his tower, and on a great sorrel steed of his he causes a saddle to be placed, which showed portrayed a golden lion. </s>
<s>  then he orders to be brought his shield, his stiff, straight lance, a sharp polished sword, his bright shining helmet, his gleaming hauberk, and triple-woven greaves. </s>
<s>  for he has seen an armed knight pass before his list against whom he wishes to strive in arms, or else this stranger will strive against him until he shall confess defeat. </s>
<s>  his command was quickly done: behold the horse now led forth. </s>
<s>  a squire brought him around already bridled and with saddle on. </s>
<s>  another fellow brings the arms. </s>
<s>  the knight passed out through the gate, as quickly as possible, all alone, without companion. </s>
<s>  erec is riding along a hill-side, when behold the knight comes tearing down over the top of the hill, mounted upon a powerful steed which tore along at such a pace that he crushed the stones beneath his hoofs finer than a millstone grinds the corn. </s>
<s>  and bright gleaming sparks flew off in all directions, so that it seemed as if his four feet were all ablaze with fire. </s>
<s>  enide heard the noise and commotion, and almost fell from her palfrey, helpless and in a faint. </s>
<s>  there was no vein in her body in which the blood did not turn, and her face became all pale and white as if she were a corpse. </s>
<s>  great is her despair and dismay, for she does not dare to address her lord, who often threatens and chides at her and charges her to hold her peace. </s>
<s>  she is distracted between two courses to pursue, whether to speak or to hold her peace. </s>
<s>  she takes counsel with herself, and often she prepares to speak, so that her tongue already moves, but the voice cannot issue forth. </s>
<s>  for her teeth are clenched with fear, and thus shut up her speech within. </s>
<s>  thus she admonishes and reproaches herself, but she closes her mouth and grits her teeth so that her speech cannot issue forth. </s>
<s>  at strife with herself, she said: "i am sure and certain that i shall incur a grievous loss, if here i lose my lord. </s>
<s>  shall i tell him all, then, openly? not i. </s>
<s>  why not? i would not dare, for thus i should enrage my lord. </s>
<s>  and if my lord's ire is once aroused, he will leave me in this wild place alone, wretched and forlorn. </s>
<s>  then i shall be worse off than now. </s>
<s>  worse off? what care i? may grief and sorrow always be mine as long as i live, if my lord does not promptly escape from here without being delivered to a violent death. </s>
<s>  but if i do not quickly inform him, this knight who is spurring hither will have killed him before he is aware. </s>
<s>  for he seems of very evil intent. </s>
<s>  i think i have waited too long from fear of his vigorous prohibition. </s>
<s>  but i will no longer hesitate because of his restraint. </s>
<s>  i see plainly that my lord is so deep in thought that he forgets himself. </s>
<s>  so it is fight that i should address him. </s>
<s> " she spoke to him. </s>
<s>  he threatens her, but has no desire to do her harm, for he realises and knows full well that she loves him above all else, and he loves her, too, to the utmost. </s>
<s>  he rides toward the knight, who challenges him to battle, and they meet at the foot of the hill, where they attack and defy each other. </s>
<s>  both smite each other with their iron-tipped lances with all their strength. </s>
<s>  the shields that hang about their necks are not worth two coats of bark: the leather tears, and they split the wood, and they shatter the meshes of the hauberks. </s>
<s>  both are pierced to the vitals by the lances, and the horses fall to earth. </s>
<s>  now, both the warriors were doughty. </s>
<s>  grievously, but not mortally, wounded, they quickly got upon their feet and grasped afresh their lances, which were not broken nor the worse for wear. </s>
<s>  but they cast them away on the ground, and drawing their swords from the scabbard, they attack each other with great fury. </s>
<s>  each wounds and injures the other, for there is no mercy on either side. </s>
<s>  they deal such blows upon the helmets that gleaming sparks fly out when their swords recoil. </s>
<s>  they split and splinter the shields. </s>
<s>  they batter and crush the hauberks. </s>
<s>  in four places the swords are brought down to the bare flesh, so that they are greatly weakened and exhausted. </s>
<s>  and if both their swords had lasted long without breaking, they would never have retreated, nor would the battle have come to an end before one of them perforce had died. </s>
<s>  enide, who was watching them, was almost beside herself with grief. </s>
<s>  whoever could have seen her then, as she showed her great woe by wringing her hands, tearing her hair and shedding tears, could have seen a loyal lady. </s>
<s>  and any man would have been a vulgar wretch who saw and did not pity her. </s>
<s>  and the knights still fight, knocking the jewels from the helmets and dealing at each other fearful blows. </s>
<s>  from the third to the ninth hour the battle continued so fierce that no one could in any wise make out which was to have the better of it. </s>
<s>  erec exerts himself and strives. </s>
<s>  he brought his sword down upon his enemy's helmet, cleaving it to the inner lining of mail and making him stagger. </s>
<s>  but he stood firmly and did not fall. </s>
<s>  then he attacked erec in turn, and dealt him such a blow upon the covering of his shield that his strong and precious sword broke when he tried to pull it out. </s>
<s>  when he saw that his sword was broken, in a spite he threw as far away as he could the part that remained in his hand. </s>
<s>  now he was afraid and must needs draw back. </s>
<s>  for any knight that lacks his sword cannot do much execution in battle or assault. </s>
<s>  erec pursues him until he begs him, for god's sake, not to kill him. </s>
<s>  "mercy, noble knight," he cries, "be not so cruel and harsh toward me. </s>
<s>  now that i am left without my sword, you have the strength and the power to take my life or make me your prisoner, for i have no means of defence. </s>
<s> " erec replies: "when thou thus dost petition me i fain would hear thee admit outright whether thou art defeated and overcome. </s>
<s>  thou shalt not again be touched by me if thou dost surrender at my discretion. </s>
<s> " the knight was slow to make reply. </s>
<s>  so, when erec saw him hesitate, in order to further dismay him, he again attacked him, rushing at him with drawn sword. </s>
<s>  whereupon, thoroughly terrified, he cried: "mercy, sire! regard me as your captive, since it cannot be otherwise. </s>
<s> " erec answers: "more than that is necessary. </s>
<s>  you shall not get off so easily as that. </s>
<s>  tell me your station and your name, and i in turn will tell you mine. </s>
<s> " "sire," says he, "you are right. </s>
<s>  i am king of this country. </s>
<s>  my liegemen are irishmen, and there is none who does not have to pay me rent. </s>
<s>   "duke," says cliges, "that will not do. </s>
<s>  in the hearing of all you must repeat those words, for it shall never be said and noised abroad that you let me off and had mercy on me. </s>
<s>  in the hearing of all those who are gathered here, you must repeat your words, if you wish to be reconciled with me. </s>
<s> " so the duke repeats his words in the hearing of all. </s>
<s>  then they make peace and are reconciled. </s>
<s>  but however the matter be regarded cliges had all the honour and glory of it, and the greeks were greatly pleased. </s>
<s>  for their part, the saxons could not laugh, all of them having plainly seen that their lord was worn out and exhausted just now. </s>
<s>  but there is no doubt at all that, if he could have helped himself, this peace would never have been made, and that cliges' soul would have been drawn from his body had it proven possible. </s>
<s>  the duke goes back to saxony sorrowing, downcast, and filled with shame. </s>
<s>  for of his men there are not even two who do not regard him as worsted, defeated, and disgraced. </s>
<s>  the saxons with all their shame have now returned to saxony, while the greeks without delay make their way with joy and gladness toward constantinople, for cliges by his prowess has opened the way for them. </s>
<s>  the emperor of germany no longer follows and convoys them. </s>
<s>  taking leave oœ the greek troops and of his daughter and cliges, and finally of the emperor, he stayed behind in germany. </s>
<s>  and the emperor of the greeks goes off happily and in joyous mood. </s>
<s>  cliges, brave and courteous, calls to mind his sire's command. </s>
<s>  if his uncle, the emperor, will give him his permission, he will go and ask him for leave to return to britain and there converse with his great-uncle, the king. </s>
<s>  for he is desirous of seeing and knowing him. </s>
<s>  so he presents himself before the emperor, and requests that he consent to let him go to britain to see his uncle and his friends. </s>
<s>  gently he proffered his request. </s>
<s>  but his uncle refused, when he had listened to the request he made. </s>
<s>  "fair nephew," he said, "it is not my will that you should wish to leave me. </s>
<s>  i shall never give you without regret this permission to go away. </s>
<s>  for it is my pleasure and desire that you should be my companion and lord, with me, of all my empire. </s>
<s> "  it is well to stop evil mouths, and therefore, if you agree, i have a proposal to make: it seems best to me to consent to feign that i am dead. </s>
<s>  i shall fall sick in a little while. </s>
<s>  and you in the meantime may plan some preparations for a place of burial. </s>
<s>  put all your wits to work to the end that a sepulchre and bier be so constructed that i shall not die in it, or be stifled, and that no one shall mount guard over it at night when you come to take me out. </s>
<s>  so now seek such a retreat for me, where no one may see me excepting you. </s>
<s>  and let no one provide for any need of mine except you, to whom i surrender and give myself. </s>
<s>  never, my whole life long, do i wish to be served by other man than you. </s>
<s>  my lord and my servant you shall be. </s>
<s>  whatever you do shall seem good to me. </s>
<s>  and never shall i be mistress of any empire unless you are its master. </s>
<s>  any wretched place, however dark and foul, will seem brighter to me than all these halls if you are with me. </s>
<s>  if i have you where i can see you, i shall be mistress of boundless treasure, and the world will belong to me. </s>
<s>  and if the business is carefully managed, no harm will come of it, and no one will ever be able to speak ill of it, for it will be believed throughout the empire that i am mouldering in the ground. </s>
<s>  my maid, thessala, who has been my nurse, and in whom i have great confidence, will give me faithful aid, for she is very clever, and i trust her fully. </s>
<s> " and cliges, when he heard his sweetheart, replies: "my lady, if this is feasible, and if you think your nurse's advice reliable, we have nothing to do but make our preparations without delay. </s>
<s>  but if we commit any imprudence, we are lost without escape. </s>
<s>  in this city there is an artisan who cuts and carves wonderful images: there is no land where he is not known for the figures which he has shapen and carved and made. </s>
<s>  john is his name, and he is a serf oœ mine. </s>
<s>  no one could cope with john's best efforts in any art, however varied it might be. </s>
<s>  for, compared with him, they are all novices, and like a child with nurse. </s>
<s>  by imitating his handiwork the artisans of antioch and rome have learned all they know how to do--and besides there is no more loyal man. </s>
<s>  now i want to make a test, and if i can put trust in him i will set him and all his descendants free. </s>
<s>  and i shall not fail to tell him of all our plan if he will swear and give his word to me that he will aid me loyally, and will never divulge my secret. </s>
<s> "  the damsel draws so near to the tower that she can touch it with her hands. </s>
<s>  she walks about, listening attentively, i suppose, if perchance she may hear some welcome sound. </s>
<s>  she looks down and she gazes up, and she sees that the tower is strong and high and thick. </s>
<s>  she is amazed to see no door or window, except one little narrow opening. </s>
<s>  moreover, there was no ladder or steps about this high, sheer tower. </s>
<s>  for this reason she surmises that it was made so intentionally, and that lancelot is confined inside. </s>
<s>  but she resolves that before she tastes of food, she will learn whether this is so or not. </s>
<s>  she thinks she will call lancelot by name, and is about to do so when she is deterred by hearing from the tower a voice which was making a marvellously sad moan as it called on death. </s>
<s>  it implores death to come, and complains of misery unbearable. </s>
<s>  in contempt of the body and life, it weakly piped in a low, hoarse tone: "ah, fortune, how disastrously thy wheel has turned for me! thou hast mocked me shamefully: a while ago i was up, but now i am down. </s>
<s>  i was well off of late, but now i am in a sorry state. </s>
<s>  not long since thou didst smile on me, but now thy eyes are filled with tears. </s>
<s>  alas, poor wretch, why didst thou trust in her, when so soon she has deserted thee! behold, in a very little while she has cast thee down from thy high estate! fortune, it was wrong of thee to mock me thus. </s>
<s>  but what carest thou! thou carest not how it may turn out. </s>
<s>  ah, sacred cross! all, holy ghost! how am i wretched and undone! how completely has my career been closed! ah, gawain, you who possess such worth, and whose goodness is unparalleled, surely i may well be amazed that you do not come to succour me. </s>
<s>  surely you delay too long and are not showing courtesy. </s>
<s>  he ought indeed to receive your aid whom you used to love so devotedly! for my part i may truly say that there is no lodging place or retreat on either side of the sea, where i would not have searched for you at least seven or ten years before finding you, if i knew you to be in prison. </s>
<s>  but why do i thus torment myself? you do not care for me even enough to take this trouble. </s>
<s>  the rustic is right when he says that it is hard nowadays to find a friend! it is easy to rest the true friend in time oœ need. </s>
<s>  alas! more than a year has passed since first i was put inside this tower. </s>
<s>  i feel hurt, gawain, that you have so long deserted me! but doubtless you know nothing of all this, and i have no ground for blaming you. </s>
<s>  yes, when i think of it, this must be the case, and i was very wrong to imagine such a thing. </s>
<s>  for i am confident that not for all the world contains would you and your men have failed to come to release me from this trouble and distress, if you were aware of it. </s>
<s>  if for no other reason, you would be bound to do this out of love for me, your companion. </s>
<s>  but it is idle to talk about it--it cannot be. </s>
<s>  ah, may the curse and the damnation of god and st. </s>
<s>  sylvester rest upon him who has shut me up so shamefully! he is the vilest man alive, this envious meleagant, to treat me as evilly as possible!" then he, who is wearing out his life in grief, ceases speaking and holds his peace. </s>
<s>  but when she, who was lingering at the base of the tower, heard what he said, she did not delay, but acted wisely and called him thus: "lancelot," as loudly as she could. </s>
<s>  "friend, up there, speak to one who is your friend!" but inside he did not hear her words. </s>
<s>  then she called out louder yet, until he in his weakness faintly heard her, and wondered who could be calling him. </s>
<s>   that the gods loved men, and taught them, and that without the gods men were sure to come to ruin. </s>
<s>  and in that they were right enough, as we know - more right even than they thought. </s>
<s>  for without god we can do nothing, and all wisdom comes from him. </s>
<s>  now, you must not think of them in this book as learned men, living in great cities, such as they were afterwards, when they wrought all their beautiful works, but as country people, living in farms and walled villages, in a simple, hard-working way. </s>
<s>  so that the greatest kings and heroes cooked their own meals, and thought it no shame, and made their own ships and weapons, and fed and harnessed their own horses. </s>
<s>  and the queens worked with their maid-servants, and did all the business of the house, and spun, and wove, and embroidered, and made their husbands' clothes and their own. </s>
<s>   so that a man was honoured among them, not because he happened to be rich, but according to his skill, and his strength, and courage, and the number of things which he could do. </s>
<s>  for they were but grown-up children, though they were right noble children too. </s>
<s>  and it was with them as it is now at school - the strongest and cleverest boy, though he be poor, leads all the rest. </s>
<s>  now, while they were young and simple they loved fairy tales, as you do now. </s>
<s>  all nations do so when they are young: our old forefathers did, and called their stories 'sagas. </s>
<s> ' i will read you some of them some day - some of the eddas, and the volusp…, and beowulf, and the noble old romances. </s>
<s>  the old arabs, again, had their tales, which we now call the 'arabian nights. </s>
<s> ' the old romans had theirs, and they called them 'fabulae,' from which our word 'fable' comes. </s>
<s>  but the old hellens called theirs 'muthoi,' from which our new word 'myth' is taken. </s>
<s>  but next to those old romances, which were written in the christian middle age, there are no fairy tales like these old greek ones, for beauty, and wisdom, and truth, and for making children love noble deeds, and trust in god to help them through. </s>
<s>  now, why have i called this book 'the heroes'? because that was the name which the hellens gave to men who were brave and skilful, and dare do more than other men. </s>
<s>  at first, i think, that was all it meant: but after a time it came to mean something more. </s>
<s>  it came to mean men who helped their country. </s>
<s>  men in those old times, when the country was half-wild, who killed fierce beasts and evil men, and drained swamps, and founded towns, and therefore after they were dead, were honoured, because they had left their country better than they found it. </s>
<s>  and we call such a man a hero in english to this day, and call it a 'heroic' thing to suffer pain and grief, that we may do good to our fellow-men. </s>
<s>  we may all do that, my children, boys and girls alike. </s>
<s>  and we ought to do it, for it is easier now than ever, and safer, and the path more clear. </s>
<s>  but you shall hear how the hellens said their heroes worked, three thousand years ago. </s>
<s>  the stories are not all true, of course, nor half of them. </s>
<s>  you are not simple enough to fancy that. </s>
<s>  but the meaning of them is true, and true for ever, and that is - do right, and god will help you. </s>
<s> ' farley court, advent, 1855. </s>
<s>  story i. </s>
<s>  - perseus part i - how perseus and his mother came to seriphos once upon a time there were two princes who were twins. </s>
<s>   their names were acrisius and proetus, and they lived in the pleasant vale of argos, far away in hellas. </s>
<s>  they had fruitful meadows and vineyards, sheep and oxen, great herds of horses feeding down in lerna fen, and all that men could need to make them blest: and yet they were wretched, because they were jealous of each other. </s>
<s>  from the moment they were born they began to quarrel. </s>
<s>  and when they grew up each tried to take away the other's share of the kingdom, and keep all for himself. </s>
<s>  so first acrisius drove out proetus. </s>
<s>  and he went across the seas, and brought home a foreign princess for his wife, and foreign warriors to help him, who were called cyclopes. </s>
<s>  and drove out acrisius in his turn. </s>
<s>  and then they fought a long while up and down the l till the quarrel was settled, and acrisius took argos and one half the l and proetus took tiryns and the other half. </s>
<s>  and proetus and his cyclopes built around tiryns great walls of unhewn stone, which are standing to this day. </s>
<s>  but there came a prophet to that hard-hearted acrisius and prophesied against him, and said, 'because you have risen up against your own blood, your own blood shall rise up against you. </s>
<s>  because you have sinned against your kindred, by your kindred you shall be punished. </s>
<s>  your daughter danae shall bear a son, and by that son's hands you shall die. </s>
<s>  so the gods have ordained, and it will surely come to pass. </s>
<s> ' and at that acrisius was very much afraid. </s>
<s>  but he did not mend his ways. </s>
<s>  he had been cruel to his own family,  instead of repenting and being kind to them, he went on to be more cruel than ever: for he shut up his fair daughter danae in a cavern underground, lined with brass, that no one might come near her. </s>
<s>  so he fancied himself more cunning than the gods: but you will see presently whether he was able to escape them. </s>
<s>  now it came to pass that in time danae bore a son. </s>
<s>  so beautiful a babe that any but king acrisius would have had pity on it. </s>
<s>  but he had no pity. </s>
<s>  for he took danae and her babe down to the seashore, and put them into a great chest and thrust them out to sea, for the winds and the waves to carry them whithersoever they would. </s>
<s>  the north-west wind blew freshly out of the blue mountains, and down the pleasant vale of argos, and away and out to sea. </s>
<s>   and away and out to sea before it floated the mother and her babe, while all who watched them wept, save that cruel father, king acrisius. </s>
<s>  so they floated on and on, and the chest danced up and down upon the billows, and the baby slept upon its mother's breast: but the poor mother could not sleep, but watched and wept, and she sang to her baby as they floated. </s>
<s>  and the song which she sang you shall learn yourselves some day. </s>
<s>  and now they are past the last blue headl and in the open sea. </s>
<s>  and there is nothing round them but the waves, and the sky, and the wind. </s>
<s>  but the waves are gentle, and the sky is clear, and the breeze is tender and low. </s>
<s>  for these are the days when halcyone and ceyx build their nests, and no storms ever ruffle the pleasant summer sea. </s>
<s>  and who were halcyone and ceyx? you shall hear while the chest floats on. </s>
<s>  halcyone was a fairy maiden, the daughter of the beach and of the wind. </s>
<s>  and she loved a sailor-boy, and married him. </s>
<s>  and none on earth were so happy as they. </s>
<s>   but at last ceyx was wrecked. </s>
<s>  and before he could swim to the shore the billows swallowed him up. </s>
<s>  and halcyone saw him drowning, and leapt into the sea to him. </s>
<s>  but in vain. </s>
<s>  then the immortals took pity on them both, and changed them into two fair sea-birds. </s>
<s>  and now they build a floating nest every year, and sail up and down happily for ever upon the pleasant seas of greece. </s>
<s>  so a night passed, and a day, and a long day it was for danae. </s>
<s>  and another night and day beside, till danae was faint with hunger and weeping, and yet no land appeared. </s>
<s>  and all the while the babe slept quietly. </s>
<s>  and at last poor danae drooped her head and fell asleep likewise with her cheek against the babe's. </s>
<s>  after a while she was awakened suddenly. </s>
<s>  for the chest was jarring and grinding, and the air was full of sound. </s>
<s>  she looked up, and over her head were mighty cliffs, all red in the setting sun, and around her rocks and breakers, and flying flakes of foam. </s>
<s>  she clasped her hands together, and shrieked aloud for help. </s>
<s>  and when she cried, help met her:  for now there came over the rocks a tall and stately man, and looked down wondering upon poor danae tossing about in the chest among the waves. </s>
<s>  he wore a rough cloak of frieze, and on his head a broad hat to shade his face. </s>
<s>  in his hand he carried a trident for spearing fish, and over his shoulder was a casting-net. </s>
<s>  but danae could see that he was no common man by his stature, and his walk, and his flowing golden hair and beard. </s>
<s>  and by the two servants who came behind him, carrying baskets for his fish. </s>
<s>  but she had hardly time to look at him, before he had laid aside his trident and leapt down the rocks, and thrown his casting-net so surely over danae and the chest, that he drew it, and her, and the baby, safe upon a ledge of rock. </s>
<s>  then the fisherman took danae by the h and lifted her out of the chest, and said - 'o beautiful damsel, what strange chance has brought you to this island in so flail a ship? who are you, and whence?  surely you are some king's daughter. </s>
<s>  and this boy has somewhat more than mortal. </s>
<s> ' and as he spoke he pointed to the babe. </s>
<s>  for its face shone like the morning star. </s>
<s>  but danae only held down her head, and sobbed out - 'tell me to what land i have come, unhappy that i am. </s>
<s>  and among what men i have fallen!' and he said, 'this isle is called seriphos, and i am a hellen, and dwell in it. </s>
<s>  i am the brother of polydectes the king. </s>
<s>  and men call me dictys the netter, because i catch the fish of the shore. </s>
<s> ' then danae fell down at his feet, and embraced his knees, and cried - 'oh, sir, have pity upon a stranger, whom a cruel doom has driven to your land. </s>
<s>  and let me live in your house as a servant. </s>
<s>  but treat me honourably, for i was once a king's daughter, and this my boy , and changed him into a partridge, which flits for ever about the hills. </s>
<s>  and daidalos fled to crete, to minos, and worked for him many a year, till he did a shameful deed, at which the sun hid his face on high. </s>
<s>  then he fled from the anger of minos, he and icaros his son having made themselves wings of feathers, and fixed the feathers with wax. </s>
<s>  so they flew over the sea toward sicily. </s>
<s>  but icaros flew too near the sun. </s>
<s>  and the wax of his wings was melted, and he fell into the icarian sea. </s>
<s>  but daidalos came safe to sicily, and there wrought many a wondrous work. </s>
<s>  for he made for king cocalos a reservoir, from which a great river watered all the l and a castle and a treasury on a mountain, which the giants themselves could not have stormed. </s>
<s>  and in selinos he took the steam which comes up from the fires of aetna, and made of it a warm bath of vapour, to cure the pains of mortal men. </s>
<s>  and he made a honeycomb of gold, in which the bees came and stored their honey, and in egypt he made the forecourt of the temple of hephaistos in memphis, and a statue of himself within it, and many another wondrous work. </s>
<s>  and for minos he made statues which spoke and moved, and the temple of britomartis, and the dancing-hall of ariadne, which he carved of fair white stone. </s>
<s>  and in sardinia he worked for i”laos, and in many a land beside, wandering up and down for ever with his cunning, unlovely and accursed by men. </s>
<s>  but theseus stood before minos, and they looked each other in the face. </s>
<s>  and minos bade take them to prison, and cast them to the monster one by one, that the death of androgeos might be avenged. </s>
<s>  then theseus cried - 'a boon, o minos! let me be thrown first to the beast. </s>
<s>  for i came hither for that very purpose, of my own will, and not by lot. </s>
<s> who art thou, then, brave youth?i am the son of him whom of all men thou hatest most, aegeus the king of athens, and i am come here to end this matter. </s>
<s> ' and minos pondered awhile, looking steadfastly at him, and he thought, 'the lad means to atone by his own death for his father's sin. </s>
<s> ' and he answered at last mildly - 'go back in peace, my son. </s>
<s>  it is a pity that one so brave should die. </s>
<s> ' but theseus said, 'i have sworn that i will not go back till i have seen the monster face to face. </s>
<s> ' and at that minos frowned, and said, 'then thou shalt see him. </s>
<s>  take the madman away. </s>
<s> ' and they led theseus away into the prison, with the other youths and maids. </s>
<s>  but ariadne, minos' daughter, saw him, as she came out of her white stone hall. </s>
<s>  and she loved him for his courage and his majesty, and said, 'shame that such a youth should die!' and by night she went down to the prison, and told him all her heart. </s>
<s>  and said - 'flee down to your ship at once, for i have bribed the guards before the door. </s>
<s>  flee, you and all your friends, and go back in peace to greece. </s>
<s>  and take me, take me with you! for i dare not stay after you are gone. </s>
<s>  for my father will kill me miserably, if he knows what i have done. </s>
<s> ' and theseus. </s>
<s>  stood silent awhile. </s>
<s>  for he was astonished and confounded by her beauty: but at last he said, 'i cannot go home in peace, till i have seen and slain this minotaur, and avenged the deaths of the youths and maidens, and put an end to the terrors of my land. </s>
<s> and will you kill the minotaur? how, then?i know not, nor do i care: but he must be strong if he be too strong for me. </s>
<s> ' then she loved him all the more, and said, 'but when you have killed him, how will you find your way out of the labyrinth?i know not, neither do i care: but it must be a strange road, if i do not find it out before i have eaten up the monster's carcase. </s>
<s> ' then she loved him all the more, and said - 'fair youth, you are too bold. </s>
<s>  but i can help you, weak as i am. </s>
<s>  i will give you a sword, and with that perhaps you may slay the beast. </s>
<s>  and a clue of thread, and by that, perhaps, you may find your way out again. </s>
<s>  only promise me that if you escape safe you will take me home with you to greece. </s>
<s>  for my father will surely kill me, if he knows what i have done. </s>
<s> ' then theseus laughed, and said, 'am i not safe enough now?'  and he hid the sword in his bosom, and rolled up the clue in his hand. </s>
<s>  and then he swore to ariadne, and fell down before her, and kissed her hands and her feet. </s>
<s>  and she wept over him a long while, and then went away. </s>
<s>  and theseus lay down and slept sweetly. </s>
<s>  and when the evening came, the guards came in and led him away to the labyrinth. </s>
<s>  and he went down into that doleful gulf, through winding paths among the rocks, under caverns, and arches, and galleries, and over heaps of fallen stone. </s>
<s>  and he turned on the left h and on the right h and went up and down, till his head was dizzy. </s>
<s>  but all the while he held his clue. </s>
<s>   for when he went in he had fastened it to a stone, and left it to unroll out of his hand as he went on. </s>
<s>  and it lasted him till he met the minotaur, in a narrow chasm between black cliffs. </s>
<s>  and when he saw him he stopped awhile, for he had never seen so strange a beast. </s>
<s>  his body was a man's: but his head was the head of a bull. </s>
<s>  and his teeth were the teeth of a lion, and with them he tore his prey. </s>
<s>  and when he saw theseus he roared, and put his head down, and rushed right at him. </s>
<s>  but theseus stept aside nimbly, and as he passed by, cut him in the knee. </s>
<s>  and ere he could turn in the narrow path, he followed him, and stabbed him again and again from behind, till the monster fled bellowing wildly. </s>
<s>  for he never before had felt a wound. </s>
<s>  and theseus followed him at full speed, holding the clue of thread in his left hand. </s>
<s>  then on, through cavern after cavern, under dark ribs of sounding stone, and up rough glens and torrent-beds, among the sunless roots of ida, and to the edge of the eternal snow, went they, the hunter and the hunted, while the hills bellowed to the monster's bellow. </s>
<s>  and at last theseus came up with him, where he lay panting on a slab among the snow, and caught him by the horns, and forced his head back, and drove the keen sword through his throat. </s>
<s>  then he turned, and went back limping and weary, feeling his way down by the clue of thread, till he came to the mouth of that doleful place and saw waiting for him, whom but ariadne! and he whispered 'it is done!' and showed her the sword. </s>
<s>  and she laid her finger on her lips, and led him to the prison, and opened the doors, and set all the prisoners free, while the guards lay sleeping heavily. </s>
<s>  for she had silenced them with wine. </s>
<s>  then they fled to their ship together, and leapt on board, and hoisted up the sail. </s>
<s>  and the night lay dark around them, so that they passed through minos' ships, and escaped all safe to naxos. </s>
<s>  and there ariadne became theseus' wife. </s>
<s>  part iv - how theseus fell by his pride but that fair ariadne never came to athens with her husband. </s>
<s>   some say that theseus left her sleeping on naxos among the cyclades. </s>
<s>  and that dionusos the wine-king found her, and took her up into the sky, as you shall see some day in a painting of old titian's - one of the most glorious pictures upon earth. </s>
<s>  and some say that dionusos drove away theseus, and took ariadne from him by force: but however that may be, in his haste or in his grief, theseus forgot to put up the white sail. </s>
<s>  now aegeus his father sat and watched on sunium day after day, and strained his old eyes across the sea to see the ship afar. </s>
<s>  and when he saw the black sail, and not the white one, he gave up theseus for dead, and in his grief he fell into the sea, and died. </s>
<s>  so it is called the aegean to this day. </s>
<s>  and now theseus was king of athens, and he guarded it and ruled it well. </s>
<s>  for he killed the bull of marathon, which had killed androgeos, minos' son. </s>
<s>  and he drove back the famous amazons, the warlike women of the east, when they came from asia, and conquered all hellas, and broke into athens itself. </s>
<s>  but theseus stopped them there, and conquered them, and took hippolute their queen to be his wife. </s>
<s>  then he went out to fight against the lapithai, and peirithoos their famous king:  but when the two heroes came face to face they loved each other, and embraced, and became noble friends. </s>
<s>  so that the friendship of theseus and peirithoos is a proverb even now. </s>
<s>   and he gathered . </s>
<s>  but from the roots there spring a number of young plants, which, after a few years of growth, mature and repeat their life cycle, while other young plants develop from the widely scattered seeds. </s>
<s>  the spaniards at times call the plant quiota. </s>
<s>  this word seems to be derived from quiotl, which is the aztec name for agave, from which plant a drink not unlike beer is produced, and suggests the possibility that there might have been a time when the succulent flower stem of the yucca furnished drink as well as food for the indians. </s>
<s>  after carefully re-reading and making several minor corrections, linda picked up her pencil, and across the top of a sheet of heavy paper sketched the peaks of a chain of mountains. </s>
<s>  across the base she drew a stretch of desert floor, bristling with the thorns of many different cacti brilliant with their gold, pink, and red bloom, intermingled with fine grasses and desert flower faces. </s>
<s>  at the left she painstakingly drew a huge plant of yucca with a perfect circle of bayonets, from the center of which uprose the gigantic flower stem the length of her page, and on the misty bloom of the flaming tongue she worked quite as late as marian thorne had ever seen a light burning in her window. </s>
<s>  when she had finished her drawing she studied it carefully a long time, adding a touch here and there, and then she said softly: "there, daddy, i feel that even you would think that a faithful reproduction tomorrow night i'll paint it. </s>
<s> "  john gilman saw the light from linda's window when he brought eileen home that night, and when he left he glanced that way again, and was surprised to see the room still lighted, and the young figure bending over a worktable. </s>
<s>  he stood very still for a few minutes, wondering what could keep linda awake so far into the night, and while his thoughts were upon her he wondered, too, why she did not care to have beautiful clothes such as eileen wore. </s>
<s>  and then he went further and wondered why, when she could be as entertaining as she had been the night she joined them at dinner, she did not make her appearance oftener. </s>
<s>  and then, because the mind is a queer thing, and he had wondered about a given state of affairs, he went a step further, and wondered whether the explanation lay in linda's inclinations or in eileen's management, and then his thought fastened tenaciously upon the subject of eileen's management. </s>
<s>  he was a patient man. </s>
<s>  he had allowed his reason and better judgment to be swayed by eileen's exquisite beauty and her blandishments. </s>
<s>  he did not regret having discovered before it was too late that marian thorne was not the girl he had thought her. </s>
<s>  he wanted a wife cut after the clinging-vine pattern. </s>
<s>  he wanted to be the dominating figure in his home. </s>
<s>  it had not taken eileen long to teach him that marian was self-assertive and would do a large share of dominating herself. </s>
<s>  he had thought that he was perfectly satisfied and very happy with eileen. </s>
<s>  yet that day he repeatedly had felt piqued and annoyed with her. </s>
<s>  she had openly cajoled and flirted with henry anderson past a point which was agreeable for any man to see his sweetheart go with another man with peter morrison she had been unspeakably charming in a manner with which john was very familiar. </s>
<s>  he turned up his coat collar, thrust his hands in his pockets, and swore softly. </s>
<s>  looking straight ahead of him, he should have seen a stretch of level sidewalk, bordered on one hand by lacy, tropical foliage, on the other, by sheets of level green lawn, broken everywhere by the uprising boles of great trees, clumps of rare vines, and rows of darkened homes, attractive in architectural _, design' vine covered, hushed for the night. </s>
<s>  what he really saw was a small plateau, sun illumined, at the foot of a mountain across the valley, where the lilac wall was the bluest, where the sun shone slightly more golden than anywhere else in the valley, where huge live oaks outstretched rugged arms, where the air had a tang of salt, a tinge of sage, an odor of orange, shot through with snowy coolness, thrilled with bird song, and the laughing chuckle of a big spring breaking from the foot of the mountain. </s>
<s>  they had left the road and followed a narrow, screened path by which they came unexpectedly into this opening. </s>
<s>  they had stood upon it in wordless enchantment, looking down the slope beneath it, across the peace of the valley, to the blue ranges beyond. </s>
<s>  "just where are we?" peter morrison had asked at last. </s>
<s>  john gilman had been looking at a view which included eileen. </s>
<s>  she lifted her face, flushed and exquisite, to peter morrison and answered in a breathless undertone, yet john had distinctly heard her: "how wonderful it would be if we were at your house. </s>
<s>  oh, i envy the woman who shares this with you !" it had not been anything in particular, yet all day it had teased john gilman's sensibilities. </s>
<s>  he felt ashamed of himself for not being more enthusiastic as he searched records and helped to locate the owner of that particular spot. </s>
<s>  to john, there was a new tone in peter's voice, a possessive light in his eyes as he studied the location, and made excursions in several directions, to fix in his mind the exact position of the land. </s>
<s>  he had indicated what he considered the topographical location for a house--stood on it facing the valley, and stepped the distance suitably far away to set a garage and figured on a short private road down to the highway. </s>
<s>  he very plainly was deeply prepossessed with a location john gilman blamed himself for not having found first. </s>
<s>  certainly nature had here grown and walled a dream garden in which to set a house of dreams. </s>
<s>  so, past midnight, gilman stood in the sunshine, looking at the face of the girl he had asked to marry him and who had said that she would. </s>
<s>  and a small doubt crept into his heart, and a feeling that perhaps life might be different for him if peter morrison decided to come to lilac valley to build his home. </s>
<s>  then the sunlight faded, night closed in, but as he went his homeward way john gilman was thinking, thinking deeply and not at all happily. </s>
<s>  chapter viii. </s>
<s>  the bear cat "friday's child is loving and giving, but saturday's child must work for a living," linda was chanting happily as she entered the kitchen early saturday morning. </s>
<s>  "katy, me blessing," she said gaily, "did i ever point out to you the interesting fact that i was born on saturday? and a devilish piece of luck it was, for i have been hustling ever since. </s>
<s>  it's bad enough to have been born on monday and spoiled wash day, but i call saturday the vanishing point, the end of the extreme limit. </s>
<s> " katy laughed,  as always, turned adoring eyes on linda. </s>
<s>  "i am not needing ye, lambie," she said. </s>
<s>  "is it big business in the canyon ye're having today? shall i be ready to be cooking up one of them god-forsaken red indian messes for ye when ye come back?" linda held up a warning finger. </s>
<s>  "hiss, katy," she said. </s>
<s>  "that is a dark secret. </s>
<s>  don't you be forgetting yourself and saying anything like that before anyone, or i would be ruined entirely. </s>
<s> " "well, i did think when ye began it," said katy, "that of all the wild foolishness ye and your pa had ever gone through with, that was the worst, but that last mess ye worked out was so tasty to the tongue that i thought of it a lot, and i am kind o' hankering for more. </s>
<s> " linda caught katy and swung her around the kitchen in a wild war dance. </s>
<s>  her gayest laugh bubbled clear from the joy peak of her soul. </s>
<s>  "katy," she said, "if you had lain awake all night trying to say something that would particularly please me, you couldn't have done better. </s>
<s>  that was a quaint little phrase and a true little phrase, and i know a little spot that it will fit exactly. </s>
<s>  what am i doing today? well, several things, katy. </s>
<s>  first, anything you need about the house. </s>
<s>  next, i am going to empty the billiard room and sell some of the excess furniture of the library, and with the returns i am going to buy me a rug and a table and some tools to work with, so i won't have to clutter up my bedroom with my lessons and things i bring in that i want to save. </s>
<s>  and then i am going to sell the technical stuff from the library and use that money where it will be of greatest advantage to me. </s>
<s>  and then, katy, i am going to manicure the bear cat and i am going to drive it again. </s>
<s> " linda hesitated. </s>
<s>  katy stood very still, thinking intently, but finally she said: "that's all right. </s>
<s>  ye have got good common sense. </s>
<s>  your nerves are steady. </s>
<s>  your pa drilled ye fine. </s>
<s>  many's the time he has bragged to me behind your back what a fine little driver he was making of ye. </s>
<s>  i don't know a girl of your age anywhere that has less enjoyment than ye. </s>
<s>  if it would be giving ye any happiness to be driving that car, ye just go ahead and drive it, lambie, but ye promise me here and now that ye will be mortal careful. </s>
<s>  in all my days i don't think i have seen a meaner-looking little baste of a car. </s>
<s> " "of course i'll be careful, katy," said linda. </s>
<s>  "that car was not bought for its beauty. </s>
<s>  its primal object in this world was to arrive. </s>
<s>  gee, how we shot curves, and coasted down the canyons, and gassed up on the level when some poor soul went batty from nerve strain! the truth is, katy, that you can't drive very slowly. </s>
<s>  you have got to go the speed for which it was built. </s>
<s>  but i have had my training. </s>
<s>  i won't forget. </s>
<s>  i adore that car, katy, and i don't know how i have ever kept my fingers off it this long. </s>
<s>  today it gets a bath and a facial treatment, and when 1 have thought up some way to meet my big problem, you're going to have a ride, katy, that will quite uplift your soul. </s>
<s>  we'll go scooting through the canyons, and whizzing around the mountains, and roaring along the beach, as slick as a white sea swallow. </s>
<s> " "now, easy, lambie, easy," said katy. </s>
<s>  "ye're planning to speed that thing before ye've got it off the jacks. </s>
<s> " "no, that was mere talk," said linda. </s>
<s>  " katy, this is my great day. </s>
<s>  i feel in my bones that i shall have enough money by night to get me some new tires, which i must have before i can start out in safety. </s>
<s> " "of course ye must, honey. </s>
<s>  i would just be tickled to pieces to let ye have what ye need. </s>
<s> " linda slid her hand across katy's lips and gathered her close in her arms. </s>
<s>  "you blessed old darling," she said. </s>
<s>  "of course you would, but i don't need it, katy. </s>
<s>  i can sit on the floor to work, if i must, and instead of taking the money from the billiard table to buy a worktable, i can buy tires with that. </s>
<s>  but here's another thing i want to tell you, katy. </s>
<s>  this afternoon a male biped is coming to this house, and he is not coming to see eileen. </s>
<s>  his name is donald whiting, and when he tells you it is, and stands very straight and takes off his hat, and looks you in the eye and says, 'calling on miss linda strong,' walk him into the living room, katy, and seat him in the best chair and put a book beside him and the morning paper. </s>
<s>  and don't you forget to do it with a flourish. </s>
<s>  he is nothing but a high-school kid, but he is the first boy that ever in all my days asked to come to see me so it's a big event. </s>
<s>  and i wish to my soul i had something decent to wear. </s>
<s> " "well, with all the clothes in this house," said katy. </s>
<s>  and then she stopped and shut her lips tight and looked at linda with belligerent irish eyes. </s>
<s>  "i know it," nodded linda in acquiescence. </s>
<s>  "i know what you think. </s>
<s>  but never mind. </s>
<s>  eileen has agreed to make me a fair allowance the first of the month, and if that isn't sufficient, i may possibly figure up some way to do some extra work that will bring me a few honest pennies, so i can fuss up enough to look feminine at times, katy. </s>
<s>  in the meantime, farewell, oh, my belovedest. </s>
<s>  call me at half-past eight, so i will be ready for business at nine. </s>
<s> " then linda went to the garage and began operations. </s>
<s>  she turned the hose on the car and washed the dust from it carefully. </s>
<s>  then she dried it with the chamois skins as she often had done before. </s>
<s>  she carefully examined the cushioning, and finding it dry and hard, she gave it a bath of olive oil and wiped and manipulated it. </s>
<s>  she cleaned the engine with extreme care. </s>
<s>  at one minute she was running to katy for kerosene to pour through the engine to loosen the carbon. </s>
<s>  at another she was telephoning for the delivery of oil, gasoline, and batteries for which she had no money to pay, so she charged them to eileen, ordering the bill to be sent on the first of the month. </s>
<s>  it seemed to her that she had only a good start when katy came after her. </s>
<s>  the business of appraising the furniture was short, and linda was well satisfied with the price she was offered for it. </s>
<s>  after the man had gone she showed katy the pieces she had marked to dispose of, and told her when they would be called for. </s>
<s>  she ate a few bites of lunch while waiting for the book man, and the results of her business with him quite delighted linda. </s>
<s>  she had not known that the value of books had risen with the price of everything else. </s>
<s>  the man with whom she dealt had known her father. </s>
<s>  he had appreciated the strain in her nature which made her suggest that he should number and appraise the books, but she must be allowed time to go through each volume in order to remove any scraps of paper or memoranda which her father so frequently left in books to which he was referring. </s>
<s>  he had figured carefully and he had made linda a far higher price than could have been secured by a man. </s>
<s>  as the girl went back to her absorbing task in the garage, she could see her way clear to the comforts and conveniences and the material that she needed for her work. </s>
<s>  when . </s>
<s> she reached the car she patted it as if it had been a living creature. </s>
<s>  "cheer up, nice old thing," she said gaily. </s>
<s>  "i know how to get new tires for you, and you shall drink all the gasoline and oil your tummy can hold. </s>
<s>  now let me see. </s>
<s>  what must i do next? i must get you off your jacks. </s>
<s>  and oh, my gracious there are the grease cups, and that's a nasty job, but it must be done. </s>
<s>  and what is the use of saturday if i can't do it? daddy often did. </s>
<s> " linda began work in utter absorption. </s>
<s>  she succeeded in getting the car off the jacks. </s>
<s>  she was lying on her back under it, filling some of the most inaccessible grease cups, and she was softly singing as she worked: "the shoes i wear are common-sense shoes--" at that minute donald whiting swung down the street, turned in at the strong residence, and rang the bell. </s>
<s>  eileen was coming down the stairs, dressed for the street. </s>
<s>  she had inquired for linda, and katy had told her that she thought miss linda had decided to begin using her car, and that she was in the garage working on it. </s>
<s>  to eileen's credit it may be said that she had not been told that a caller was expected. </s>
<s>  linda never before had had a caller  as always, eileen was absorbed in her own concerns. </s>
<s>  had she got the rouge a trifle brighter on one cheek than on the other? was the powder evenly distributed? would the veil hold the handmade curls in exactly the proper place? when the bell rang her one thought might have been that some of her friends were calling for her. </s>
<s>  she opened the door, and when she learned that linda was being asked for, it is possible that she mistook the clean, interesting, and well-dressed youngster standing before her for a mechanic. </s>
<s>  what she said was: "linda's working on her car. </s>
<s>  go around to the left and you will find her in the garage, and for heaven's sake, get it right before you let her start out, for we've had enough horror in this family from motor accidents. </s>
<s> " then she closed the door before him and stood buttoning her gloves. </s>
<s>  a wicked and malicious smile spreading over her face. </s>
<s>  "just possibly," she said, "that youngster is from a garage, but if he is, he is the best imitation of the real thing that i have seen in these chaotic days. </s>
<s> " donald whiting stopped at the garage door and looked in, before linda had finished her grease cups, and in time to be informed that he might wear common-sense shoes if he chose. </s>
<s>  at his step, linda rolled her black head on the cement floor and raised her eyes. </s>
<s>  she dropped the grease cup, and her face reddened deeply. </s>
<s>  "oh, my lord!" she gasped breathlessly. </s>
<s>  "i forgot to tell katy when to call me!" in that instant she also forgot that the stress of the previous four years had accustomed men to seeing women do any kind of work in any kind of costume. </s>
<s>  but soon linda realized that donald whiting was not paying any particular attention either to her or to her occupation. </s>
<s>  he was leaning forward, gazing at the car with positively an enraptured expression on his eager young face. </s>
<s>  "shades of jehu!" he cried. </s>
<s>  "it's a bear cat!" linda felt around her head for the grease cup. </s>
<s>  "why, sure it's a bear cat," she said with the calmness of complete recovery. </s>
<s>  "and it's just about ready to start for its very own cave in the canyon. </s>
<s> " donald whiting pitched his hat upon the seat, shook off his coat, and sent it flying after the hat. </s>
<s>  then he began unbuttoning and turning back his sleeves. </s>
<s>  "here, let me do that," he said authoritatively. </s>
<s>  "gee! i have never yet ridden in a bear cat. </s>
<s>  take me with you, will you, linda?" "sure," said linda, pressing the grease into the cup with a little paddle and holding it up to see if she had it well filled. </s>
<s>  "sure, but there's no use in you getting into this mess, because i have only got two more. </s>
<s>  you look over the engine. </s>
<s>  did you ever grind valves, and do you think these need it?" "why, they don't need it," said donald, "if they were all right when it was jacked up. </s>
<s> " "well, they were," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it was running like a watch when it went to sleep. </s>
<s>  but do we dare take it out on these tires?" "how long has it been?" asked donald, busy at the engine. </s>
<s>  "all of four years," answered linda. </s>
<s>  donald whistled softly and started a circuit of the car, kicking the tires and feeling them. </s>
<s>  "have you filled them?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "no," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i did not want to start the engine until i had finished everything else. </s>
<s> " "all right," he said, "i'll look at the valves first and then, if it is all ready, there ought to be a garage near that we can run to carefully, and get tuned up. </s>
<s> " "there is," said linda. </s>
<s>  "there is one only a few blocks down the street where dad always had anything done that he did not want to do himself. </s>
<s> " "that's that, then," said donald. </s>
<s>  linda crawled from under the car and stood up, wiping her hands on a bit of waste. </s>
<s>  "do you know what tires cost now?" she asked anxiously. </s>
<s>  "they have 'em at the garage," answered donald, "and if i were you, i wouldn't get a set. </s>
<s>  i would get two. </s>
<s>  i would-put them on the rear wheels. </s>
<s>  you might be surprised at how long some of these will last. </s>
<s>  anyway, that would be the thing to do. </s>
<s> " "of course," said linda, in a relieved tone. </s>
<s>  "that would be the thing to do. </s>
<s> " "now," she said, "i must be excused a few minutes till i clean up so i am fit to go on the streets. </s>
<s>  i hope you won't think i forgot you were coming. </s>
<s> "  donald laughed drily. </s>
<s>  "when 'shoes' was the first word i heard," he said, "i did not for a minute think you had forgotten. </s>
<s> " "no, i didn't forget," said linda. </s>
<s>  "what i did do was to become so excited about cleaning up the car that i let time go faster than i thought it could. </s>
<s>  that was what made me late. </s>
<s> " "well, forget it!" said donald. </s>
<s>  "run along and jump into something, and let us get our tires and try kitty out. </s>
<s> " linda reached up and released the brakes. </s>
<s>  she stepped to one side of the car and laid her hands on it. </s>
<s>  "let us run it down opposite the kitchen door," she said, "then you go around to the front, and i'll let you in, and you can read something a few minutes till i make myself presentable. </s>
<s> " "oh, i'll stay out here and look around the yard and go over the car again," said the boy. </s>
<s>  "what a bunch of stuff you have got growing here. </s>
<s>  i don't believe i ever saw half of it before. </s>
<s> " "it's daddy's and my collection," said linda. </s>
<s>  "some day i'll show you some of the things, and tell you how we got them, and why they are rare. </s>
<s>  today i just naturally can't wait a minute until i try my car. </s>
<s> " "is it really yours?" asked donald enviously. </s>
<s>  "yes," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it's about the only thing on earth that is peculiarly and particularly mine. </s>
<s>  i haven't a doubt there are improved models, but daddy had driven this car only about nine months. </s>
<s>  it was going smooth as velvet, and there's no reason why it should not keep it up, though i suspect that by this time there are later models that could outrun it. </s>
<s> " "oh, i don't know," said the boy. </s>
<s>  "it looks like some little old car to me. </s>
<s>  i bet it can just skate. </s>
<s> " "i know it can," said linda, "if i haven't neglected something. </s>
<s>  we'll start carefully, and we'll have the inspector at the salesrooms look it over. </s>
<s> " then linda entered the kitchen door to find katy with everything edible that the house afforded spread before her on the table. </s>
<s>  "why, katy, what are you doing?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "i was makin' ready," explained katy, "to fix ye the same kind of lunch i would for miss eileen. </s>
<s>  will ye have it under the live oak, or in the living room?" "neither," said linda. </s>
<s>  "come upstairs with me, and in the storeroom you'll find the lunch case and the thermos bottles and don't stint yourself, katy. </s>
<s>  this is a rare occasion. </s>
<s>  it never happened before. </s>
<s>  probably it will never happen again. </s>
<s>  let's make it high altitude while we are at it. </s>
<s> " "i'll do my very best with what i happen to have," said katy. </s>
<s>  "but i warn you right now i am making a good big hole in the sunday dinner. </s>
<s> " "i don't give two whoops," said linda, "if there isn't any sunday dinner. </s>
<s>  in memory of hundreds of times that we have eaten bread and milk, make it a banquet, katy, and we'll eat bread and milk tomorrow. </s>
<s> " then she took the stairway at a bound, and ran to her room. </s>
<s>  ln a very short time she emerged, clad in a clean blouse and breeches' her climbing boots, her black hair freshly brushed and braided. </s>
<s>  "i ought to have something," said linda, "to shade my eyes. </s>
<s>  i the glare's hard on them facing the sun. </s>
<s> " going down the hall she came to the storeroom, opened a drawer' and picked out a fine black felt alpine hat that had belonged to her father. </s>
<s>  she carried it back to her room  standing at the glass, tried it on, pulling it down on one side, turning it up at the other, and striking a deep cleft across the crown. </s>
<s>  she looked at herself intently for a minute, and then she reached up and deliberately loosened the hair at her temples. </s>
<s>  "not half bad, all things considered, linda," she said. </s>
<s>  " oh, how you do need a tich of color. </s>
<s> " she ran down the hall and opened the door to eileen's room, and going to her chiffonier, pulled out a drawer containing an array of gloves, veils, and ribbons. </s>
<s>  at the bottom of the ribbon stack, her eye caught the gleam of color for which she was searching, and she deftly slipped out a narrow scarf of roman stripes with a deep black fringe at the end. </s>
<s>  sitting down, she fitted the hat over her knee, picked up the dressing-table scissors,and ripped off the band. </s>
<s>  in its place she fitted the ribbon, pinning it securely and knotting the ends so that the fringe reached her shoulder. </s>
<s>  then she tried the hat again. </s>
<s>  the result was blissfully satisfactory. </s>
<s>  the flash of orange, the blaze of red, the gleam of green, were what she needed. </s>
<s>  "thank you very much, sister mine," she said, "i know you i would be perfectly delighted to loan me this. </s>
<s> "  chapter ix. </s>
<s>  one hundred per cent plus then she went downstairs and walked into the kitchen, prepared for what she would see, by what she heard as she approached. </s>
<s>  with katy's apron tied around his waist, donald whiting was occupied in squeezing orange, lemon, and pineapple juice over a cake of ice in a big bowl, preparatory to the compounding of katy's most delicious brand of fruit punch. </s>
<s>  without a word, linda stepped to the bread board and began slicing the bread and building sandwiches, while katy hurried her preparations for filling the lunch box. </s>
<s>  a few minutes later katy packed them in the car, kissed linda good-bye, and repeatedly cautioned donald to make her be careful. </s>
<s>  as the car rolled down the driveway and into the street, donald looked appraisingly at the girl beside him. </s>
<s>  "is it the prevailing custom in lilac valley for young ladies to kiss the cook?" inquired donald laughingly. </s>
<s>  "now, you just hush," said linda. </s>
<s>  "katy is not the cook, alone. </s>
<s>  katy's my father, and my mother, and my family, and my best friend--" "stop right there," interposed donald. </s>
<s>  "that is quite enough for any human to be. </s>
<s>  katy's a multitude. </s>
<s>  she came out to the car with the canteen, and when i offered to help her, without any 'polly foxin',' she just said: 'sure. </s>
<s>  come in and make yourself useful. </s>
<s> ' so i went, and i am expecting amazing results from the job she gave me. </s>
<s> " "come to think of it," said linda, "i have small experience with anybody's cooking except katy's and my own, but so far as i know, she can't very well be beaten. </s>
<s> " carefully she headed the car into the garage adjoining the salesrooms. </s>
<s>  there she had an ovation. </s>
<s>  the manager and several of the men remembered her. </s>
<s>  the whole force clustered around the bear cat and began to examine it, and comment on it, and linda climbed out and asked to have the carburetor adjusted, while the mechanic put on a pair of tires. </s>
<s>  when everything was satisfactory, she backed to the street, and after a few blocks of experimental driving, she headed for the automobile club to arrange for her license and then turned straight toward multiflores canyon, but she did not fail to call donald whiting's attention to every beauty of lilac valley as they passed through. </s>
<s>  when they had reached a long level stretch of roadway leading to the canyon, linda glanced obliquely at the boy beside her. </s>
<s>  "it all comes back as natural as breathing," she said. </s>
<s>  "i couldn't forget it any more than i could forget how to walk, or to swim. </s>
<s>  sit tight. </s>
<s>  i am going to step on the gas for a bit, just for old sake's sake. </s>
<s> " "that's all right," said donald, taking off his hat and giving his head a toss so that the wind might have full play through his hair. </s>
<s>  "but remember our tires are not safe. </s>
<s>  better not go the limit until we get rid of these old ones, and have a new set all around. </s>
<s> " linda settled back in her seat, took a firm grip on the wheel, and started down the broad, smooth highway, gradually increasing the speed. </s>
<s>  the color rushed to her cheeks. </s>
<s>  her eyes were gleaming. </s>
<s>  "listen to it purr!" she cried to donald. </s>
<s>  "if you hear it begin to growl, tell me. </s>
<s> " and then for a few minutes they rode like birds on the path of the wind. </s>
<s>  when they approached the entrance to the canyon, gradually linda slowed down. </s>
<s>  she turned an exultant flashing face to donald whiting. </s>
<s>   "that was a whizzer," said the boy. </s>
<s>  "i'll tell you i don't know what i would give to have a car like this for my very own. </s>
<s>  i'll bet not another girl in los angeles has a car that can go like that. </s>
<s> " "and i don't believe i have any business with it," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but since circumstances make it mine, i am going to keep it and i am going to drive it. </s>
<s> " "of course you are," said donald emphatically. </s>
<s>  "don't you ever let anybody fool you out of this car, because if they wanted to, it would be just because they are jealous to think they haven't one that will go as fast. </s>
<s> " "there's not the slightest possibility of my giving it up so long as i can make the engine turn over," she said. </s>
<s>  "i told you how father always took me around with him, and there's nothing in this world i am so sure of as i am sure that i am spoiled for a house cat. </s>
<s>  i have probably less feminine sophistication than any girl of my age in the world, and i probably know more about camping and fishing and the scientific why and wherefore of all outdoors than most of them. </s>
<s>  i just naturally had such a heavenly time with daddy that it never has hurt my feelings to be left out of any dance or party that ever was given. </s>
<s>  the one thing that has hurt is the isolation. </s>
<s>  since i lost daddy i haven't anyone but katy. </s>
<s>  sometimes, when i see a couple of nice, interesting girls visiting with their heads together, a great feeling of envy wells up in my soul, and i wish with all my heart that i had such a friend. </s>
<s> " "ever try to make one?" asked donald. </s>
<s>  "there are mighty fine girls in the high school. </s>
<s> " "i have seen several that i thought i would like to be friends with," said linda, "but i am so lacking in feminine graces that i haven't known how to make advances, in the first place, and i haven't had the courage, in the second. </s>
<s> " "i wish my sister were not so much older than you," said donald. </s>
<s>  "how old is your sister?" inquired linda. </s>
<s>  "she will be twenty-three next birthday," said donald. </s>
<s>  "and of all the nice girls you ever saw, she is the queen. </s>
<s> " "yes," she assented, "i am sure i have heard your sister mentioned. </s>
<s>  but didn't you tell me she had been reared for society?" "no, i did not," said donald emphatically. </s>
<s>  "i told you mother j believed in dressing her as the majority of other girls were dressed, but i didn't say she had been reared for society. </s>
<s>  she has been reared with an eye single to making a well-dressed, cultured, and gracious woman. </s>
<s> " "i call that fine," said linda. </s>
<s>  "makes me envious of you. </s>
<s>  now forget everything except your eyes and tell me what you see. </s>
<s>  have you ever been here before?" "i have been through a few times before, but seems to me i | never saw it looking quite so pretty. </s>
<s> " linda drove carefully, but presently donald uttered an exclamation as she swerved from the road and started down what appeared to be quite a steep embankment and headed straight for the stream. </s>
<s>  "sit tight," she said tersely. </s>
<s>  "the bear cat just loves its cave. </s>
<s>  it knows where it is going. </s>
<s> " she broke through a group of young willows and ran the car ! into a tiny plateau, walled in a circle by the sheer sides of the ! canyon reaching upward almost out of sight, topped with great jagged overhanging boulders. </s>
<s>  crowded to one side, she stopped the car and sat quietly, smiling at donald whiting. </s>
<s>  "how about it?" she asked in a low voice. </s>
<s>  the boy looked around him, carefully examining the canyon walls, and then at the level, odorous floor where one could not step without crushing tiny flowers of white, cerise, blue, and yellow. </s>
<s>  big ferns grew along the walls, here and there "our lord's candles" lifted high torches not yet lighted, the ambitious mountain stream skipped and circled and fell over its rocky bed, while many canyon wrens were singing. </s>
<s>  "do you think," she said, "that anyone driving along here at an ordinary rate of speed would see that car?" "no," said donald, getting her idea, "i don't believe they would. </s>
<s> "  "all right, then," said linda. </s>
<s>  "toe up even and i'll race you to the third curve where you see the big white sycamore. </s>
<s> " donald had a fleeting impression of a flash of khaki, a gleam of red, and a wave of black as they started. </s>
<s>  he ran with all the speed he had ever attained at a track meet. </s>
<s>  he ran with all his might. </s>
<s>  he ran until his sides strained and his breath came short. </s>
<s>  but the creature beside him was not running. </s>
<s>  she was flying. </s>
<s>  and long before they neared the sycamore he knew he was beaten, so he laughingly cried to her to stop it. </s>
<s>  linda turned to him panting and laughing. </s>
<s>  "i make that dash every time i come to the canyon, to keep my muscle up, but this is the first time i have had anyone to race with in a long time. </s>
<s> " then together they slowly walked down the smooth black floor between the canyon walls. </s>
<s>  as they crossed a small bridge linda leaned over and looked down. </s>
<s>  "anyone at your house care about 'nose twister'?" she asked lightly. </s>
<s>  "why, isn't that watercress?" asked donald. </s>
<s>  "sure it is," said linda. </s>
<s>  "anyone at your house like it?" "every one of us," answered donald. </s>
<s>  "we're all batty about cress salad-- say, that reminds me of something! if you know so much about this canyon and everything in it, is there any place in it where a fellow could find a plant, a kind of salad lettuce, that the indians used to use?" "might be," said linda carelessly. </s>
<s>  "for why?" "haven't you heard of the big sensation that is being made in feminine circles by the new department in everybody's home?" inquired donald. </s>
<s>  "mother and mary louise were discussing it the other day at lunch, and they said that some of the recipes for dishes to be made from stuff the indians used sounded delicious. </s>
<s>  one reminded them of cress, and when we saw the cress i wondered if i could get them some of the other. </s>
<s> " "might," said linda drily, "if you could give me a pretty good idea of what it is that you want. </s>
<s> " "when you know cress, it's queer that you wouldn't know other things in your own particular canyon," said donald. </s>
<s>  linda realized that she had overdone her disinterestedness a trifle. </s>
<s>  "i suspect it's miners' lettuce you want," she said. </s>
<s>  "of course i know where there's some, but you will want it as fresh as possible if you take any, so we'll finish our day first and gather it the last thing before we leave. </s>
<s> " how it started neither of them noticed, but they had not gone far before they were climbing the walls and hanging to precarious footings. </s>
<s>  her cheeks flushed, her eyes brilliant, her lips laughing, linda was showing donald thrifty specimens of that cotyledon known as "old hen and chickens," telling him of the rare echeveria of the same family, and her plunge down the canyon side while trying to uproot it, exulting that she had brought down the plant without a rift in the exquisite bloom on its leaves. </s>
<s>  linda told about her fall, and the two men who had passed at that instant, and how she had met them later, and who they were, and what they were doing. </s>
<s>  then donald climbed high for a bunch of larkspur, and linda showed him how to turn his back to the canyon wall and come down with the least possible damage to his person and clothing. </s>
<s>  when at last both of them were tired they went back to the car. </s>
<s>  linda spread an old indian blanket over the least flower-grown spot she could select, brought out the thermos bottles and lunch case, and served their lunch. </s>
<s>  with a glass of fruit punch in one hand and a lettuce sandwich in the other, donald smiled at linda. </s>
<s>  "i'll agree about katy. </s>
<s>  she knows how," he said appreciatively. </s>
<s>  "katy is more than a cook," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "she is a human being. </s>
<s>  she has the biggest, kindest heart. </s>
<s>  when anybody's sick or in trouble she is the greatest help. </s>
<s>  she is honest. </s>
<s>  she has principles. </s>
<s>  she is intelligent. </s>
<s>  in her spare time she reads good books and magazines. </s>
<s>  she knows what is going on in the world. </s>
<s>  she can talk intelligently on almost any subject. </s>
<s>  it's no disgrace to be a cook. </s>
<s>  if it were, katy would be unspeakable. </s>
<s>  fact is, at the present minute there's no one in all the world so dear to me as katy. </s>
<s>  i always talk irish with her. </s>
<s> " "well, i call that rough on your sister," said donald. </s>
<s>  "maybe it is," conceded linda. </s>
<s>  "i suspect a lady wouldn't have i said that, but eileen and i are so different. </s>
<s>  she never has made the slightest effort to prove herself lovable to me, and so i have never learned to love her. </s>
<s>  which reminds me--how did you happen to come to the garage?" "the very beautiful young lady who opened the door mistook me for a mechanic. </s>
<s>  she told me i would find you working on your car and for goodness' sake to see that it was in proper condition before you drove it. </s>
<s> " linda looked at him with wide, surprised eyes in which a trace of indignation was plainly discernible. </s>
<s>  "now listen to me," she said deliberately. </s>
<s>  "eileen is a most sophisticated young lady. </s>
<s>  if she saw you, she never in this world, thought you were a mechanic sent from a garage presenting yourself at our front door. </s>
<s> "  "there might have been a spark of malice in the big blue-gray i eyes that carefully appraised me," said donald. </s>
<s>  "your choice of words is good," said linda, refilling the punch glass. </s>
<s>  "'appraise' fits eileen like her glove. </s>
<s>  she appraises every thing on a monetary basis, and when she can't figure that it's going to be worth an appreciable number of dollars and cents to her--'to the garage wid it,' as katy would say. </s>
<s> " when they had finished their lunch linda began packing the box and donald sat watching her. </s>
<s>  "at this point," said linda, "daddy always smoked. </s>
<s>  do you smoke?" there was a hint of deeper color in the boy's cheeks. </s>
<s>  "i did smoke an occasional cigarette," he said lightly, "up to the day, not a thousand years ago, when a very emphatic young lady who should have known, insinuated that it was bad for the nerves, and going on the presumption that she knew, i haven't smoked a cigarette since and i am not going to until i find out whether i can do better work without them. </s>
<s> " linda folded napkins and packed away accessories thoughtfully. </s>
<s>  then she looked into the boy's eyes. </s>
<s>  "now we reach the point of our being here together," she said. </s>
<s>  "it's time to fight, and i am sorry we didn't go at it gas and bomb ›' the minute we met. </s>
<s>  you're so different from what i thought you were. </s>
<s>  if anyone had told me a week ago that you would take off your coat and mess with my automobile engine, or wear katy's apron and squeeze lemons in our kitchen i would have looked ! him over for daddy's high sign of hysteria, at least. </s>
<s>  it's too bad to i have such a good time as i have had this afternoon, and then end with a fight. </s>
<s> " i"that's nothing," said donald. </s>
<s>  "you couldn't have had as | good a time as i have had. </s>
<s>  you're like another boy. </s>
<s>  a fellow can be just a fellow with you, and somehow you make everything you touch mean something it never meant before. </s>
<s>  you have made me feel that i would be about twice the man i am if i had spent the time i have wasted in plain jazzing around, hunting cotyledon or trap-door spiders' nests. </s>
<s> " "i get you," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it's the difference between a girl reared in an atmosphere of georgette and rouge, and one who has grown up in the canyons with the oaks and sycamores. </s>
<s>  one is natural and the other is artificial. </s>
<s>  most boys prefer the artificial. </s>
<s> " "i thought i did myself," said donald, "but today has taught me that i don't. </s>
<s>  i think, linda, that you would make the finest friend a fellow ever had. </s>
<s>  i firmly and finally decline to fight with you. </s>
<s>  but for god's sake, linda, tell me how i can beat that little cocoanut-headed jap. </s>
<s> " linda slammed down the lid to the lunch box. </s>
<s>  her voice was smooth and even but there was battle in her eyes and she answered decisively: "well, you can't beat him calling him names. </s>
<s>  there is only one way on god's footstool that you can beat him. </s>
<s>  you can't beat him legislating against him. </s>
<s>  you can't beat him boycotting him. </s>
<s>  you can't beat him with any tricks. </s>
<s>  he is as sly as a cat and he has got a whole bag full of tricks of his own, and he has proved right here in los angeles that he has got a brain that is hard to beat. </s>
<s>  all you can do, and be a man commendable to your own soul, is to take his subject and put your brain on it to such purpose that you cut pigeon wings around him. </s>
<s>  what are you studying in your classes, anyway?" "trigonometry, rhetoric, ancient history, astronomy," answered donald. </s>
<s>  "and is your course the same as his?" inquired linda. </s>
<s>  "strangely enough it is," answered donald. </s>
<s>  "we have been in the same classes all through high school. </s>
<s>  i think the little monkey- -" "man, you mean," interposed linda. </s>
<s>  "'man,'" conceded donald. </s>
<s>  "has waited until i selected my course all the way through, and then he has announced what he would take. </s>
<s>  he probably figured that i had somebody with brains back of the course i selected, and that whatever i studied would be suitable for him. </s>
<s> " "i haven't a doubt of it," said linda. </s>
<s>  "they are quick. </s>
<s>  oh! they are quick. </s>
<s>  and they know from their cradles what it is that they have in the backs of their heads. </s>
<s>  we are not going to beat them driving them to mexico or to canada, or letting them monopolize china. </s>
<s>  that is merely temporizing. </s>
<s>  that is giving them fertile soil on which to take the best of their own and the level best of ours, and by amalgamating the two, build higher than we ever have. </s>
<s>  there is just one way in all this world that we can beat eastern civilization and all that it intends to do to us eventually. </s>
<s>  the white man has dominated by his color so far in the history of the world, but it is written in the books that when the men of color acquire our culture and combine it with their own methods of living and rate of production, they are going to bring forth greater numbers, better equipped for the battle of life, than we are. </s>
<s>  when they have got our last secret, constructive or scientific, they will take it, and living in a way that we would not, reproducing in numbers we don't, they will beat us at any game we start, if we don't take warning while we are in the ascendancy, and keep there. </s>
<s> " "well, there is something to think about," said donald whiting, staring past linda at the side of the canyon as if he had seen the same handwriting on the wall that dismayed belshazzar at the feast that preceded his downfall. </s>
<s>  "i see what you're getting at," he said. </s>
<s>  "i had thought that there might be some way to circumvent him. </s>
<s> " "there is!" broke in linda hastily. </s>
<s>  "there is. </s>
<s>  you can beat him, but you have got to beat him in an honorable way and in a way that is open to him as it is to you. </s>
<s> " "i'll do anything in the world if you will only tell me how," said donald. </s>
<s>  "maybe you think it isn't grinding me and humiliating me properly. </s>
<s>  maybe you think father and mother haven't warned me. </s>
<s>  maybe you think mary louise isn't secretly ashamed of me. </s>
<s>  how can i beat him, linda?" linda's eyes were narrowed to a mere line. </s>
<s>  she was staring at the wall back of donald as if she hoped that heaven would intercede in her favor and write thereon a line that she might translate to the boy's benefit. </s>
<s>  "i have been watching pretty sharply," she said. </s>
<s>  "take them as a race, as a unit--of course there are exceptions, there always are --but the great body of them are mechanical. </s>
<s>  they are imitative. </s>
<s>  they are not developing anything great of their own in their own country. </s>
<s>  they are spreading all over the world and carrying home sewing machines and threshing machines and automobiles and cantilever bridges and submarines and aeroplanes--anything from eggbeaters to telescopes. </s>
<s>  they are not creating one single thing. </s>
<s>  they are not missing imitating everything that the white man can do anywhere else on earth. </s>
<s>  they are just like the germans so far as that is concerned. </s>
<s> " "i get that, all right enough," said donald. </s>
<s>  "now go on. </s>
<s>  what is your deduction? how the devil am i to beat the best? he is perfect, right straight along in everything. </s>
<s> " the red in linda's cheeks deepened. </s>
<s>  her eyes opened their widest. </s>
<s>  she leaned forward, and with her closed fist, pounded the blanket before him. </s>
<s>  "then, by gracious," she said sternly, "you have got to do something new. </s>
<s>  you have got to be perfect, plus. </s>
<s> " "'perfect, plus?'" gasped donald. </s>
<s>   "yes, sir!" said linda emphatically. </s>
<s>  "you have got to be perfect, plus. </s>
<s>  if he can take his little mechanical brain and work a thing out till he has got it absolutely right, you have got to go further than that and discover something pertaining to it not hitherto thought of and start something new. </s>
<s>  i tell you you must use your brains. </s>
<s>  you should be more than an imitator. </s>
<s>  you must be a creator!" donald started up and drew a deep breath. </s>
<s>  "well, some job i call that," he said. </s>
<s>  "who do you think i am, the almighty?" "no," said linda quietly, "you are not. </s>
<s>  you are merely his son, created in his own image, like him, according to the book, and you have got to your advantage the benefit of all that has been learned down the ages. </s>
<s>  we have got to take up each subject in your course, and to find some different books treating this same subject. </s>
<s>  we have got to get at it from a new angle. </s>
<s>  we must dig into higher authorities. </s>
<s>  we have got to coach you till, when you reach the highest note possible for the parrot, you can go ahead and embellish it with a few mocking-bird flourishes. </s>
<s>  all oka sayye knows how to do is to learn the lesson in his book perfectly, and he is 100 per cent. </s>
<s>  i have told you what you must do to add the plus, and you can do it if you are the boy i take you for. </s>
<s>  people have talked about the 'yellow peril' till it's got to be a meaningless phrase. </s>
<s>  somebody must wake up to the realization that it's the deadliest peril that ever has menaced white civilization. </s>
<s>  why shouldn't you have your hand in such wonderful work?" "linda," said the boy breathlessly, "do you realize that you have been saying 'we'? can you help me? will you help me?" "no," said linda, "i didn't realize that i had said 'we. </s>
<s> ' i didn't mean two people, just you and me. </s>
<s>  i meant all the white boys and girls of the high school and the city and the state and the whole world. </s>
<s>  if we are going to combat the 'yellow peril' we must combine against it. </s>
<s>  we have got to curb our appetites and train our brains and enlarge our hearts till we are something bigger and finer and numerically greater than this yellow peril. </s>
<s>  we can't take it and pick it up and push it into the sea. </s>
<s>  we are not germans and we are not turks. </s>
<s>  i never wanted anything in all this world worse than i want to see you graduate ahead of oka sayye. </s>
<s>  and then i want to see the white boys and girls of canada and of england and of norway and sweden and australia, and of the whole world doing exactly what i am recommending that you do in your class and what i am doing personally in my own. </s>
<s>  i have had japs in my classes ever since i have been in school, but father always told me to study them, to play the game fairly, but to beat them in some way, in some fair way, to beat them at the game they are undertaking. </s>
<s> " "well, there is one thing you don't take into consideration," said donald. </s>
<s>  "all of us did not happen to be fathered by alexander strong. </s>
<s>  maybe we haven't all got your brains. </s>
<s> " "oh, posher!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "i know of a case where a little indian was picked up from a tribal battlefield in south america and brought to this country and put into our schools, and there was nothing that any white pupil in the school could do that he couldn't, so long as it was imitative work. </s>
<s>  you have got to be constructive. </s>
<s>  you have got to work out some way to get ahead of them. </s>
<s>  and if you will take the history of the white races and go over their great achievements in mechanics, science, art, literature--anything you choose--when a white man is constructive, when he does create, he can simply cut circles around the colored races. </s>
<s>  the thing is to get the boys and girls of today to understand what is going on in the world, what they must do as their share in making the world safe for their grandchildren. </s>
<s>  life is a struggle. </s>
<s>  it always has been. </s>
<s>  it always will be. </s>
<s>  there is no better study than to go into the canyons or the deserts and efface yourself and watch life. </s>
<s>  it's an all-day process of the stronger annihilating the weaker. </s>
<s>  the one inexorable thing in the world is nature. </s>
<s>  the eagle dominates the hawk. </s>
<s>  the hawk, the falcon. </s>
<s>  the falcon, the raven. </s>
<s>  and so on down to the place where the hummingbird drives the moth from his particular trumpet flower. </s>
<s>  the big snake swallows the little one. </s>
<s>  the big bear appropriates the desirable cave. </s>
<s> "  "and is that what you are recommending people to do?" "no," said linda, "it is not. </s>
<s>  that is wild. </s>
<s>  we go a step ahead of the wild, or we ourselves become wild. </s>

<s>  katy to the rescue linda delivered donald whiting at his door with an armload of books and a bundle of miners' lettuce and then drove to her home in lilac valley--in the eye of the beholder on the floor-level macadam road. </s>
<s>  in her own eye she scarcely grazed it. </s>
<s>  the smooth, easy motion of the car, the softly purring engine were thrilling. </s>
<s>  the speed at which she was going was like having wings on her body. </s>
<s>  the mental stimulus she had experienced in concentrating her brain on donald whiting's problem had stimulated her imagination. </s>
<s>  the radiant color of spring. </s>
<s>  the chilled, perfumed, golden air. </s>
<s>  the sure sense of having found a friend, had ruffled the plumes of her spirit. </s>
<s>  on the home road donald had plainly indicated that he would enjoy spending the morrow with her, and she had advised him to take the books she had provided and lock himself in his room and sweat out some information about monday's lessons which would at least arrest his professor's attention, and lead his mind to the fact that something was beginning to happen. </s>
<s>  and then she had laughingly added: "tomorrow is katy's turn. </s>
<s>  i told the old dear i would take her as soon as i felt the car was safe. </s>
<s>  every day she does many things that she hopes will give me pleasure. </s>
<s>  this is one thing i can do that i know will delight her. </s>
<s> " "next saturday, then?" questioned donald. </s>
<s>  and linda nodded. </s>
<s>   "sure thing. </s>
<s>  i'll be thinking up some place extra interesting. </s>
<s>  come in the morning if you want, and we'll take a lunch and go for the day. </s>
<s>  which do you like best, mountains or canyons or desert or sea?" "i like it best wherever what you're interested in takes you," said donald simply. </s>
<s>  "all right, then," answered linda, "we'll combine business and pleasure. </s>
<s> " so they parted with another meeting arranged. </s>
<s>  when she reached home she found katy tearfully rejoicing, plainly revealing how intensely anxious she had been. </s>
<s>  but when linda told her that the old tires had held, that the car ran wonderfully, that everything was perfectly safe, that she drove as unconsciously as she breathed, and that tomorrow katy was to go for a long ride, her joy was incoherent. </s>
<s>  linda laughed. </s>
<s>  she patted katy and started down the hallway, when she called back: "what is this package?" "a delivery boy left it special only a few minutes ago. </s>
<s>  must be something miss eileen bought and thought she would want tomorrow, and then afterward she got this invitation and went on as she was. </s>
<s> " linda stood gazing at the box. </s>
<s>  it did look so suspiciously like a dress box. </s>
<s>  "katy," she said, "i have just about got an irresistible impulse to peep. </s>
<s>  i was telling eileen last night of a dress i saw that i thought perfect. </s>
<s>  it suited me better than any other dress i ever did see. </s>
<s>  it was at 'the mode. </s>
<s> ' this box is from 'the mode. </s>
<s> ' could there be a possibility that she sent it up specially for me?" "i think she would put your name on it if she meant it for ye," said katy. </s>
<s>  "one peep would show me whether it is my dress or not," said linda, "and peep i am going to. </s>
<s> " she began untying the string. </s>
<s>  "there's one thing," said katy, "miss eileen's sizes would never fit ye. </s>
<s> " "might," conceded linda. </s>
<s>  "i am taller than she is, but i could wear her waists if i wanted to, and she always alters her skirts herself to save the fees. </s>
<s>  glory be! this is my dress, and there's a petticoat and stockings to match it. </s>
<s>  why, the nice old thing! i suggested hard enough, but in my heart i hardly thought she would do it. </s>
<s>  oh, dear, now if i only had some shoes, and a hat. </s>
<s> " linda was standing holding the jacket in one h the stockings in the other, her face flaming. </s>
<s>  katy drew herself to full height. </s>
<s>  she reached over and picked the things from linda's fingers. </s>
<s>  "if ye know that is your dress, lambie," she said authoritatively, "ye go right out and get into that car and run to town and buy ye a pair of shoes. </s>
<s> " "but i have no credit anywhere and i have no money, yet," said linda. </s>
<s>  "well, i have," said katy, "and this time ye're going to stop your stubbornness and take enough to get ye what you need. </s>
<s>  ye go to the best store in los angeles and come back here with a pair of shoes that just match those stockings, and ye go fast, before the stores close. </s>
<s>  if ye've got to speed a little, do it in the country and do it judacious. </s>
<s> " "katy, you're arriving!" cried linda. </s>
<s>  "'judicious speeding' is one thing i learned better than any other lesson about driving a motor car. </s>
<s>  three fourths of the driving father and i did we were speeding judiciously. </s>
<s> " katy held the skirt to linda's waist. </s>
<s>  "well, maybe it's a little shorter than any you have been wearing, but it ain't as short as eileen and all the rest of the girls your age have them, so that's all right, honey. </s>
<s>  slip on your coat. </s>
<s> " katy's fingers were shaking as she lifted the jacket and linda slipped into it. </s>
<s>  "oh, lord," she groaned, "ye can't be wearing that! the sleeves don't come much below your elbows. </s>
<s> " "you will please to observe," said linda, "that they are flowing sleeves and they are not intended to come below the elbows. </s>
<s>  but it's a piece of luck i tried it on, for it reminds me that it's a jacket suit and i must have a blouse. </s>
<s>  when you get the shoe money, make it enough for a blouse--two blouses, katy, one for school and one to fuss up in a little. </s>
<s> " without stopping to change her clothing, linda ran to the garage and hurried back to the city. </s>
<s>  it was less than an hour's run, but she made it in ample time to park her car and buy the shoes. </s>
<s>  she selected a pair of low oxfords of beautiful color, matching the stockings. </s>
<s>  then she hurried to one of the big drygoods stores and bought the two waists and an inexpensive straw hat that would harmonize with the suit. </s>
<s>  a hat small enough to stick, in the wind, with brim enough to shade her eyes. </s>
<s>  in about two hours she was back with katy and they were in her room trying on the new clothing. </s>
<s>  "it dumbfounds me," said linda, "to have eileen do this for me. </s>
<s> " she had put on the shoes and stockings, a plain georgette blouse of a soft, brownish wood-gray, with a bit of heavy brown silk embroidery decorating the front, and the jacket. </s>
<s>  the dress was of silky changeable tricolette, the skirt plain. </s>
<s>  where a fold lifted and was strongly lighted, it was an exquisite silver-gray. </s>
<s>  where a shadow fell deeply it was gray-brown. </s>
<s>  the coat reached half way to the knees. </s>
<s>  it had a rippling skirt with a row of brown embroidery around it, a deep belt with double buttoning at the waistline, and collar and sleeves in a more elaborate pattern of the same embroidery as the skirt. </s>
<s>  linda perched the hat on her head, pulled it down securely, and faced katy. </s>
<s>  "now then!" she challenged. </s>
<s>  "and it's a perfect dress!" said katy proudly, "and you're just the colleen to wear it. </s>
<s>  my, but i wisht your father could be seeing ye the now. </s>
<s> " with almost reverent hands linda removed the clothing and laid it away. </s>
<s>  then she read a letter from marian that was waiting for her, telling katy scraps of it in running comment as she scanned the sheets. </s>
<s>  "she likes her boarding place. </s>
<s>  there are nice people in it. </s>
<s>  she has got a wonderful view from the windows of her room. </s>
<s>  she is making friends. </s>
<s>  she thinks one of the men at nicholson and snow's is just fine. </s>
<s>  he is helping her all he can, on the course she is taking. </s>
<s>  and she wants us to look carefully everywhere for any scrap of paper along the hedge or around the shrubbery on the north side of the house. </s>
<s>  one of her three sheets of plans is missing. </s>
<s>  i don't see where in the world it could have gone, katy. </s>
<s> " katy spread out her hands in despair. </s>
<s>  "there was not a scrap of a sheet of paper in the room when i cleaned it," she said, "not a scrap. </s>
<s>  and if i had seen a sheet flying around the yard i would have picked it up. </s>
<s>  she just must be mistaken about having lost it here. </s>
<s>  she must have opened her case on the train and lost it there. </s>
<s> " linda shook her head. </s>
<s>  "i put that stuff in the case myself," she said, "and the clothes on top of it, and she wouldn't have any reason for taking those things out on the train. </s>
<s>  i can't underst but she did have three rough sketches. </s>
<s>  she had her heart set on winning that prize and it would be a great help to her, and certainly it was the most comprehensive and convenient plan for a house of that class that i ever have seen. </s>
<s>  if i ever have a house, she is going to plan it, even if she doesn't get to plan john gilman's as he always used to say that she should. </s>
<s>  and by the way, katy, isn't it kind of funny for eileen to go away over sunday when it's his only holiday?" "oh, she'll telephone him," said katy, "and very like, he'll go down, or maybe he is with her. </s>
<s>  ye needn't waste any sympathy on him. </s>
<s>  eileen will take care that she has him so long as she thinks she wants him. </s>
<s> " later it developed that eileen had secured the invitation because she was able to produce three most eligible men. </s>
<s>  not only was john gilman with the party, but peter morrison and henry anderson were there as well. </s>
<s>  it was in the nature of a hastily arranged celebration, because the deal for three acres of land that peter morrison most coveted on the small plateau, mountain walled, in lilac valley, was in escrow. </s>
<s>  he had made a payment on it. </s>
<s>  anderson was working on his plans. </s>
<s>  contractors had been engaged, and on monday work would begin. </s>
<s>  the house was to be built as soon as possible, and peter morrison had arranged that the garage was to be built first. </s>
<s>  this he meant to occupy as a residence so that he could be on hand to superintend the construction of the new home and to protect, as far as possible, the natural beauty and the natural growth of the location. </s>
<s>  early sunday morning linda and katy, with a full lunch box and a full gasoline tank, slid from the driveway and rolled down the main street of lilac valley toward the desert. </s>
<s>  "we'll switch over and strike san fernando road," said linda, "and i'll scout around sunland a bit and see if i can find anything that will furnish material for another new dish. </s>
<s> " that day was wonderful for katy. </s>
<s>  she trotted after linda over sandy desert reaches, along the seashore, up mountain trails, and through canyons connected by long stretches of motoring that was more like flying than riding. </s>
<s>  she was tired but happy when she went to bed. </s>
<s>  monday morning she was an interested spectator as linda dressed for school. </s>
<s>  "sure, and hasn't the old chrysalis opened up and let out the nicest little lady-bird moth, katy?' inquired linda as she smoothed her gray-gold skirts. </s>
<s>  "i think myself that this dress is a trifle too good for school. </s>
<s>  when i get my allowance next week i think i'll buy me a cloth skirt and a couple of wash waists and save this for better. </s>
<s>  but it really was good of eileen to take so much pains and send it to me, when she was busy planning a trip. </s>
<s> " katy watched linda go, and she noted the new light in her eyes, the new lift of her head, and the proud sureness of her step, and she wondered if a new dress could do all that for a girl, she scarcely believed that it could. </s>
<s>   too, she had very serious doubts about the dress. </s>
<s>  she kept thinking of it during the day, and when eileen came, in the middle of the afternoon, at the first words on her lips: "has my dress come?" katy felt a wave of illness surge through her. </s>
<s>  she looked at eileen so helplessly that that astute reader of human nature immediately suspected something. </s>
<s>  "i sent it special," she said, "because i didn't know at the time that i was going to riverside and i wanted to work on it. </s>
<s>  isn't it here yet?" then katy prepared to do battle for the child of her heart. </s>
<s>  "was the dress ye ordered sent the one miss linda was telling ye about?" she asked tersely. </s>
<s>  "yes, it was," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "linda has got mighty good taste. </s>
<s>  any dress she admired was sure to be right. </s>
<s>  she said there was a beautiful dress at 'the mode'. </s>
<s>  i went and looked, and sure enough there was, a perfect beauty. </s>
<s> " "but she wanted the dress for herself," said katy. </s>
<s>  "it was not a suitable dress for school," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "well, it strikes me," said katy, "that it was just the spittin' image of fifty dresses i have seen ye wear to school. </s>
<s>  "what do you know about it?" demanded eileen. </s>
<s>  "i know just this," said katy with determination. </s>
<s>  "ye've had one new dress in the last few days and you're not needin' another. </s>
<s>  the blessed virgin only knows when miss linda's had a dress. </s>
<s>  she thought ye'd done yourself proud and sent it for her, and she put it on, and a becoming and a proper thing it was too! i advanced her the money myself and sent her to get some shoes to match it since she had her car fixed and could go in a hurry. </s>
<s>  a beautiful dress it is, and on her back this minute it is !" eileen was speechless with anger. </s>
<s>  her face was a sickly white and the rouge spots on her cheeks stood a glaring admission "do you mean to tell me--" she gasped. </s>
<s>  "not again," said the daughter of erin firmly, "because i have already told ye wance. </s>
<s>  linda's gone like a rag bag since the lord knows when. </s>
<s>  she had a right to the dress, and she thought it was hers, and she took it. </s>
<s>  and if ye ever want any more respect or obedience or love from the kiddie, ye better never let her know that ye didn't intend it for her, for nothing was ever quite so fair and right as that she should have it. </s>
<s>  and while you're about it you'd better go straight to the store and get her what she is needin' to go with it, or better still, ye had better give her a fair share of the money of which there used to be such a plenty, and let her get her things herself, for she is that tasty nobody can beat her when she is got anything to do with. </s>
<s> " eileen turned on katy in a gust of fury. </s>
<s>  "katherine o'donovan," she said shrilly, "pack your trunk and see how quick you can get out of this house. </s>
<s>  i have stood your insolence for years, and i won't endure it a minute longer!" katy folded her red arms and lifted her red chin, and a steel-blue light flashed from her steel-gray eyes. </s>
<s>  "humph!" she said, "i'll do nothing of the sort. </s>
<s>  i ain't working for ye and i never have been no more than i ever worked for your mother. </s>
<s>  every lick i ever done in this house i done for linda and doctor strong and for nobody else. </s>
<s>  half of this house and everything in it belongs to linda, and it's a mortal short time till she is of age to claim it. </s>
<s>  whichever is her half, that half i'll be staying in, and if ye manage so as she is got nothing to pay me, i'll take care of her without pay till the day comes when she can take care of me. </s>
<s>  go to wid ye, ye triflin', lazy, self-possessed creature. </s>
<s>  ten years i have itched to tell ye what i thought of ye, and now ye know it. </s>
<s> " as katy's rage increased, eileen became intimidated. </s>
<s>  like every extremely selfish person she was a coward in her soul. </s>
<s>  "if you refuse to go on my orders," she said, "i'll have john gilman issue his. </s>
<s> " then katy set her left hand on her left hip, her lower jaw shot past the upper, her doubled right fist shook precious near the tip of eileen's exquisite little nose. </s>
<s>  "i am darin' ye," she shouted. </s>
<s>  "i am just darin' ye to send john gilman in the sound of my voice. </s>
<s>  if ye do, i'll tell him every mean and selfish thing ye've done to me poor lambie since the day of the black shadow. </s>
<s>  send him to me? holy mither, i wish ye would! if ever i get my chance at him, don't ye think i won't be tellin' him what he has lost, and what he has got? and as for taking orders from him, i am taking my orders from the person i am working for, and as i told ye before, that's miss linda. </s>
<s>  be off wid ye, and primp up while i get my supper, and mind ye this,, if ye tell miss linda ye didn't mean that gown for her and spoil the happy day she has had, i won't wait for ye to send john gilman to me. </s>
<s>  i'll march straight to him. </s>
<s>  put that in your cigarette and smoke it! think i have lost me nose as well as me sense?" then katy started a triumphal march to the kitchen and cooled down by the well-known process of slamming pots and pans for half an hour. </s>
<s>  soon her irish sense of humor came to her rescue. </s>
<s>  "now, don't i hear myself telling miss linda a few days ago to kape her temper, and to kape cool, and to go aisy. </s>
<s>  look at the aise of me when i got started. </s>
<s>  by gracious, wasn't i just itching to wallop her?" then every art that katy possessed was bent to the consummation of preparing a particularly delicious dinner for the night. </s>
<s>  linda came in softly humming something to herself about the kind of shoes that you might wear if you chose. </s>
<s>  she had entered the high school that morning with an unusually brilliant color. </s>
<s>  two or three girls, who never had noticed her before, had nodded to her that morning, and one or two had said: "what a pretty dress you have!" she had caught the flash of approval in the eyes of donald whiting, and she had noted the flourish with which he raised his hat when he saw her at a distance, and she knew what he meant when he held up a book, past the covers of which she could see protruding a thick fold of white paper. </s>
<s>  he had foresworn whatever pleasure he might have thought of for sunday. </s>
<s>  he had prepared notes on some subject that he thought would further him. </s>
<s>  the lift of his head, the flourish of his hat, and the book all told linda that he had struggled and that he felt the struggle had brought an exhilarating degree of success. </s>
<s>  that had made the day particularly bright for linda. </s>
<s>  she had gone home with a feeling of uplift and exultation in her heart. </s>
<s>  as she closed the front door she cried up the stairway: "eileen, are you there?" "yes," answered a rather sulky voice from above. </s>
<s>  linda ascended, two steps at a bound. </s>
<s>  "thank you over and over, old thing!" she cried as she raced down the hallway. </s>
<s>  "behold me! i never did have a more becoming dress, and katy loaned me money, till my income begins, to get shoes and a little scuff hat to go with it. </s>
<s>  aren't i spiffy?" she pirouetted in the doorway. </s>
<s>  eileen gripped the brush she was wielding, tight. </s>
<s>  "you have good taste," she said. </s>
<s>  "it's a pretty dress, but you're always howling about things being suitable. </s>
<s>  do you call that suitable for school?" "it certainly is an innovation for me," said linda, "but there are dozens of dresses of the same material, only different cut and colors in the high school today. </s>
<s>  as soon as i get my money i'll buy a skirt and some blouses so i won't have to wear this all the time. </s>
<s>  but i surely do thank you very much, and i surely have had a lovely day. </s>
<s>  did you have a nice time at riverside?" eileen slammed down the brush and turned almost a distorted face to linda. </s>
<s>  she had temper to vent. </s>
<s>  in the hour's reflection previous to linda's coming, she realized that she had reached the limit with katy. </s>
<s>  if she antagonized her by word or look, she would go to john gilman, and eileen dared not risk what she would say. </s>
<s>  "no, i did not have a lovely time," she said. </s>
<s>  "i furnished the men for the party and i expected to have a grand time, but the first thing we did was to run into that inflated egotist calling herself mary louise whiting, and like a fool, janie brunson introduced her to peter morrison. </s>
<s>  i had paired him with janie on purpose to keep my eye on him. </s>
<s> " linda tried hard but she could not suppress a chuckle: "of course you would!" she murmured softly. </s>
<s>  eileen turned her back. </s>
<s>  that had been her first confidence to linda. </s>
<s>  she was so aggrieved at that moment that she could have told unanswering walls her tribulations. </s>
<s>  it would have been better if she had done so. </s>
<s>  she might have been able to construe silence as sympathy. </s>
<s>  linda's laughter she knew exactly how to interpret. </s>
<s>  "served you right," was what it meant. </s>
<s>  "i hadn't the least notion you would take an interest in anything concerning me," she said. </s>
<s>  "people can talk all they please about mary louise whiting being a perfect lady but she is a perfect beast. </s>
<s>  i have met her repeatedly and she has always ignored me, and yesterday she singled out for her special attention the most desirable man in my party--" "'most desirable,'" breathed linda. </s>
<s>  "poor john! i see his second fiasco. </s>
<s>  lavender crystals, please!" eileen caught her lip in mortification. </s>
<s>  she had not intended to say what she thought. </s>
<s>  "well, you can't claim," she hurried on to cover her confusion, "that it was not an ill-bred, common trick for her to take possession of a man of my party, and utterly ignore me. </s>
<s>  she has everything on earth that i want. </s>
<s>  she treats me like a dog, and she could give me a glorious time by merely nodding her head. </s>
<s> " "i am quite sure you are mistaken," said linda. </s>
<s>  "from what i have heard of her, she wouldn't mistreat anyone. </s>
<s>  very probably what she does is merely to feel that she is not acquainted with you. </s>
<s>  you have an unfortunate way, eileen, of defeating your own ends. </s>
<s>  if you wanted to attract mary louise whiting, you missed the best chance you ever could have had, at three o'clock saturday afternoon, when you maliciously treated her only brother as you would a mechanic, ordered him to our garage, and shut our door in his face. </s>
<s> " eileen turned to linda. </s>
<s>  her mouth fell open. </s>
<s>  a ghastly greenish white flooded her face. </s>
<s>  "what do you mean?" she gasped. </s>
<s>  "i mean," said linda, "that donald whiting was calling on me, and you purposely sent him to the garage. </s>
<s> " crash down among the vanities of eileen's dressing table went her lovely head, and she broke into deep and violent sobs. </s>
<s>  linda stood looking at her a second, slowly shaking her head. </s>
<s>  then she turned and went to her room. </s>
<s>  later in the evening she remembered the roman scarf and told eileen of what she had done, and she was unprepared for eileen's reply: "that scarf always was too brilliant for me. </s>
<s>  you're welcome to it if you want it. </s>
<s> " "thank you," said linda gravely, "i want it very much indeed. </s>
<s> "  chapter xi. </s>
<s>  assisting providence linda went to the library to see to what state of emptiness it had been reduced by the removal of several pieces of furniture she had ordered taken away that day. </s>
<s>  as she stood on the threshold looking over the room as usual, a throb of loving appreciation of katy swept through her heart. </s>
<s>  katy had been there before her. </s>
<s>  the room had been freshly swept and dusted, the rugs had been relaid, the furniture rearranged skilfully, and the table stood at the best angle to be lighted either by day or night. </s>
<s>  on the table and the mantel stood big bowls of lovely fresh flowers. </s>
<s>  linda was quite certain that anyone entering the room for the first time would have felt it completely furnished, and she doubted if even marian would notice the missing pieces. </s>
<s>  cheered in her heart, she ran up to the billiard room, and there again katy had preceded her. </s>
<s>  the windows were shining. </s>
<s>  the walls and floor had been cleaned. </s>
<s>  everything was in readiness for the new furniture. </s>
<s>  her heart full of gratitude, linda went to her room, prepared her lessons for the next day, and then drew out her writing materials to answer marian's letter. </s>
<s>  she wrote: i have an acute attack of enlargement of the heart. </s>
<s>  so many things have happened since your leaving. </s>
<s>  but first i must tell you about your sketch. </s>
<s>  we just know you did not leave it here. </s>
<s>  katy says there was not a scrap in our bedroom when she cleaned it. </s>
<s>  and as she knows you make plans and how precious they are to you, i guarantee she would have saved it if she had found anything looking like a parallelogram on a piece of paper. </s>
<s>  and i have very nearly combed the lawn, not only the north side, but the west, south, and east. </s>
<s>  and then i broke the laws and went over to your house and crawled through a basement window and worked my way up, and i have hunted every room in it, but there is nothing there. </s>
<s>  you must have lost that sketch after you reached san francisco. </s>
<s>  i hope to all that's peaceful you did not lay it down in the offices of nicholson and snow, or where you take your lessons. </s>
<s>  i know nothing about architecture, but i do know something about comfort in a home, and i thought that was the most comfortable and convenient-looking house i ever had seen. </s>
<s>  now i'll go on and tell you all the news, and i don't know which is the bigger piece to burst on you first. </s>
<s>  would you be more interested in knowing that peter morrison has bought three acres on the other side of the valley from us and up quite a way, or in the astonishing fact that i have a new dress, a perfect love of a dress, really too good for school? you know there was blood in my eye when you left, and i didn't wait long to start action. </s>
<s>  i have managed to put the fear of god into eileen's heart so that she has agreed to a reasonable allowance for me from the first of next month. </s>
<s>  but she must have felt at least one small wave of contrition when i told her about a peculiarly enticing dress i had seen at the mode. </s>
<s>  she sent it up right away, and katy, blessed be her loving footprints, loaned me money to buy a blouse and some shoes to match, so i went to school today looking very like the great general average, minus rouge, lipstick, hairdress, and french heels. </s>
<s>  i do hope you will approve of two things i have done. </s>
<s>  then linda recounted the emptying of the billiard room, the inroads in the library, the listing of the technical books, and what she proposed to do with the money. </s>
<s>  and then, her face slightly pale and her fingers slightly trembling, she wrote:  marian dear, i hope you won't be angry with me when i tell you that i have put the bear cat into commission and driven it three times already. </s>
<s>  it is running like the feline it is, and i am being as careful as i can. </s>
<s>  i know exactly how you will feel. </s>
<s>  it is the same feeling that has held me all these months, when i wouldn't even let myself think of it. </s>
<s>  but something happened at school one day, marian. </s>
<s>  you know the whitings? mary louise whiting's brother is in the senior class. </s>
<s>  he is a six-footer, and while he is not handsome he is going to be a real man when he is fully developed, and steadied down to work. </s>
<s>  one day last week he made it his business to stop me in the hall and twit me about my shoes, and incidentally to ask me why i didn't dress like the other girls. </s>
<s>  and some way it came rougher than if it had been one of the girls. </s>
<s>  the more i thought about it the more wronged i felt, so i ended in a young revolution that is to bring me an income, a suitable place to work in and has brought me such a pretty dress. </s>
<s>  i think it has brought eileen to a sense of at least partial justice about money, and it brought me back the bear cat. </s>
<s>  you know the proudest moment of my life was when father would let me drive the little beast, and it all came back as natural as breathing. </s>
<s>  please don't worry, marian. </s>
<s>  nothing shall happen, i promise you. </s>
<s>  it won't be necessary to tell you that katy is her darling old self, loyal and steadfast as the sun, and quite as necessary and as comforting to me. </s>
<s>  and i have a couple of other interests in life that are going to--i won't say make up for your absence, because nothing could do that--but they are going to give me something interesting to think about, something agreeable to work at, while you are gone. </s>
<s>   oh, marian, do hurry. </s>

<s>  be saturday's child yourself if you must, just so you get home quick, and where your white head makes a beacon light for the truest, lovingest pal you will ever have,                         linda. </s>
<s>  linda laid down the pen, slid down in her chair, and looked from the window across the valley, and she wondered if in her view lay the location that had been purchased by peter morrison. </s>
<s>  she glanced back at her letter and sat looking at the closing lines and the signature. </s>
<s>  "much good that will do her," she commented. </s>
<s>  "when a woman loves a man and loves him with all her heart, as marian loved john, and when she loses him, not because she has done a single unworthy thing herself, but because he is so rubber spined that he will let another woman successfully intrigue him, a lot of comfort she is going to get from the love of a schoolgirl!" linda's eyes strayed to the window again, and traveled down to the city and up the coast, all the way to san francisco, and out of the thousands of homes there they pictured a small, neat room, full of marian's belongings, and marian herself bending over a worktable, absorbed in the final draft of her precious plans. </s>
<s>  linda could see marian as plainly as she ever had seen her, but she let her imagination run, and she fancied that when marian was among strangers and where no one knew of john gilman's defection, that hers might be a very heavy heart, that hers might be a very sad face. </s>
<s>  then she went to planning. </s>
<s>  she had been desolate, heart hungry, and isolated herself. </s>
<s>  first she had endured, then she had fought. </s>
<s>  the dawn of a new life was breaking over her hill. </s>
<s>  she had found work she was eager to do. </s>
<s>  she could put the best of her brain, the skill of her fingers, the creative impulse of her heart, into it. </s>
<s>  she was almost sure that she had found a friend. </s>
<s>  she had a feeling that when the coming saturday had been lived donald whiting would be her friend. </s>
<s>  he would want her advice and her help in his work. </s>
<s>  she would want his companionship and the stimulus of his mind, in hers. </s>
<s>  what linda had craved was a dear friend among the girls, but no girl had offered her friendship. </s>
<s>  this boy had, so she would accept what the gods of time and circumstance provided. </s>
<s>  it was a very wonderful thing that had happened to her. </s>
<s>  now why could not something equally wonderful happen to marian? linda wrinkled her brows and thought deeply. </s>
<s>  "it's the worst thing in all this world to work and work with nobody to know about it and nobody to care," thought linda. </s>
<s>  "marian could break a record if she thought john gilman cared now as he used to. </s>
<s>  it's almost a necessary element to her success. </s>
<s>  if he doesn't care, she ought to be made to feel that somebody cares. </s>
<s>  this thing of standing alone, since i have found a friend, appeals to me as almost insupportable. </s>
<s>  let me think. </s>
<s> " it was not long until she had worked out a scheme for putting an interest in marian's life and giving her something for which to work, until a more vital reality supplanted it. </s>
<s>  the result was that she took some paper, went down to the library, and opening the typewriter, wrote a letter. </s>
<s>  she read it over, making many changes and corrections, and then she copied it carefully. </s>
<s>  when she came to addressing it she was uncertain, but at last she hit upon a scheme of sending it in the care of nicholson and snow because marian had told her that she meant to enter their contest immediately she reached san francisco, and she would have left them her address. </s>
<s>  on the last reading of the letter she had written, she decided that it was a manly, straightforward production, which should interest and attract any girl. </s>
<s>  but how was she to sign it? after thinking deeply for a long time, she wrote "philip sanders, general delivery," and below she added a postscript: to save you the trouble of inquiring among your friends as to who philip sanders is, i might as well tell you in the beginning that he isn't. </s>
<s>  he is merely an assumption under which i shall hide my personality until you let me know whether it is possible that you could become even slightly interested in me, as a small return for the very deep and wholesome interest abiding in my heart for you. </s>
<s>  "abiding," said linda aloud. </s>
<s>  "it seems to me that there is nothing in all the world quite so fine as a word. </s>
<s>  isn't 'abiding' a good word? doesn't it mean a lot? where could you find one other word that means being with you and also means comforting you and loving you and sympathizing with you and surrounding you with firm walls and a cushioned floor and a starry roof? i love that word. </s>
<s>  i hope it impresses marian with all its wonderful meaning. </s>
<s> " she went back to her room, put both letters into her geometry, and in the morning mailed them. </s>
<s>  she stood a long time hesitating with the typewritten letter in her h but finally dropped it in the letter box also. </s>
<s>  "it will just be something," she said, "to make her think that some man appreciates her lovely face and doesn't care if her hair is white, and sees how steadfast and fine she is. </s>
<s> " and then she slowly repeated, " 'steadfast,' that is another fine word. </s>
<s>  it has pearls and rubies all over it. </s>
<s> " after school that evening she visited james brothers' and was paid the full amount of the appraisement of her furniture. </s>
<s>  then she went to an art store and laid in a full supply of the materials she needed for the work she was trying to do. </s>
<s>  her fingers were trembling as she handled the boxes of water colors and selected the brushes and pencils for her work, and sheets of drawing paper upon which she could do herself justice. </s>
<s>  when the transaction was finished, she had a few dollars remaining. </s>
<s>  as she put them in her pocket she said softly: "that's gasoline. </s>
<s>  poor katy! i am glad she doesn't need her money, because she is going to have to wait for the allowance or the sale of the books or on jane meredith. </s>
<s>  but it's only a few days now, so that'll be all right. </s>
<s> "  chapter xii. </s>
<s>  the lay of the land linda entered the street car for her daily ride to lilac valley. </s>
<s>  she noticed peter morrison and henry anderson sitting beside each other, deeply engrossed in a drawing. </s>
<s>  she had been accustomed to ride in the open section of the car as she liked the fresh air. </s>
<s>  she had a fleeting thought of entering the body of the car and sitting where they would see her. </s>
<s>  and then a perverse spirit in linda's heart said to her: "that is precisely what eileen would do. </s>
<s>  you sit where you belong. </s>
<s> " whereupon linda dropped into the first vacant seat she could reach, but it was only a few moments before peter morrison, looking up from the plans he was studying, saw her, and lifting his hat, beckoned her to come and sit with him. </s>
<s>  they made room for her between them and spreading the paper across her lap, all three of them began to discuss the plans for the foundation for peter's house. </s>
<s>  anderson had roughly outlined the grounds, sketching in the trees that were to be saved, the spring, and the most available route for reaching the road. </s>
<s>  the discussion was as to where the road should logically enter the grounds, and where the garage should stand. </s>
<s>  "which reminds me," said linda--"haven't you your car with you? or was that a hired one you were touring in?" "mine," said peter morrison, "but we toured so far, it's in the shop for a general overhauling today. </s>
<s> " "that being the case," said linda, "walk home with me and i'll take you to your place in mine and bring you back to the cars, if you only want to stay an hour or two. </s>
<s> " "why, that would be fine," said peter. </s>
<s>  "you didn't mention, the other evening, that you had a car. </s>
<s> " "no," said linda, "i had been trying to keep cars out of my thought for a long time, but i could endure it no longer the other day, so i got mine out and tuned it up. </s>
<s>  if you don't mind stacking up a bit, three can ride in it very comfortably. </s>
<s> " that was the way it happened that linda walked home after school that afternoon between peter morrison and his architect, brought out the bear cat, and drove them to peter's location. </s>
<s>  all that day, workmen had been busy under the management of a well-instructed foreman, removing trees and bushes and stones and clearing the spot that had been selected for the garage and approximately for the house. </s>
<s>  the soft brownish gray of linda's dress was exactly the color to intensify the darker brown of her eyes. </s>
<s>  there was a fluctuating red in her olive cheeks, a brilliant red framing her even white teeth. </s>
<s>  once dressed so that she was satisfied with the results, linda immediately forgot her clothes, and plunged into morrison's plans. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said gravely, with peter perfectly cognizant of the twinkle in her dark eyes, "peter, you may save money in a straight-line road, but you're going to sin against your soul if you build it. </s>
<s>  you'll have to economize in some other way, and run your road around the base of those boulders, then come in straight to the line here, and then you should swing again and run out on this point, where guests can have one bewildering glimpse of the length of our blue valley, and then whip them around this clump of perfumy lilac and elders, run them to your side entrance, and then scoot the car back to the garage. </s>
<s>  i think you should place the front of your house about here. </s>
<s> " linda indicated where. </s>
<s>  "so long as you're buying a place like this you don't want to miss one single thing. </s>
<s>  and you do want to make the very most possible out of every beauty you have. </s>
<s>  and you mustn't fail to open up and widen the runway from that energetic, enthusiastic spring. </s>
<s>  carry it across your road, sure. </s>
<s>  it will cost you another little something for a safe bridge, but there's nothing so artistic as a bridge with a cold stream running under it. </s>
<s>  and think what a joyful time i'll have, gathering specimens for you of every pretty water plant that grows in my particular canyon. </s>
<s>  any time when you're busy in your library and you hear my car puffing up the incline and around the corner and rattling across the bridge, you'll know that i am down here giving you a start of watercress and miners' lettuce and every lovely thing you could mention that likes to be nibbled or loved-up, while it dabbles its toes in the water. </s>
<s> " peter morrison looked at linda reflectively. </s>
<s>  he looked for such a long moment that henry anderson reached a nebulous conclusion. </s>
<s>  "fine!" he cried. </s>
<s>  "every one of those suggestions is valuable to an inexperienced man. </s>
<s>  morrison, shan't i make a note of them?" "yes, henry, you shall," said peter. </s>
<s>  "i am going to push this thing as fast as possible, so far as building the garage is concerned and getting settled in it. </s>
<s>  after that i don't care if i live on this spot until we know each other by the inch, before i begin building my home. </s>
<s>  at the present minute it appeals to me that 'home' is about the best word in the language of any nation. </s>
<s>  i have a feeling that what i build here is going to be my home, very possibly the only one i shall ever have. </s>
<s>  we must find the spot on which the lord intended that a house should grow on this hillside, and then we must build that house so that it has a room suitable for a workshop in which i may strive, under the best conditions possible, to get my share of the joy of life and to earn the money that i shall require to support me and entertain my friends. </s>
<s>  and that sounds about as selfish as anything possibly could. </s>
<s>  it seems to be mostly 'me' and 'mine,' and it's not the real truth concerning this house. </s>
<s>  i don't believe there is a healthy, normal man living who has not his dream. </s>
<s>  i have no hesitation whatever in admitting that i have mine. </s>
<s>  this house must be two things. </s>
<s>  it has got to be a concrete workshop for me, and it has got to be an abstract abiding place for a dream. </s>
<s>  it's rather difficult to build a dream house for a dream lady, so i don't know what kind of a fist i am going to make of it. </s>
<s> " linda sat down on a boulder and contemplated her shoes for a minute. </s>
<s>  then she raised her ever-shifting, eager, young eyes to peter, and it seemed to him as he looked into them that there were little gold lights flickering at the bottom of their darkness. </s>
<s>  "why, that's just as easy," she said. </s>
<s>  "a home is merely a home. </s>
<s>  it includes a front porch and a back porch and a fireplace and a bathtub and an ice chest and a view and a garden around it. </s>
<s>  all the rest is incidental. </s>
<s>  if you have more money, you have more incidentals. </s>
<s>  if you don't have so much, you use your imagination and think you have just as much on less. </s>
<s> " "now, i wonder," said peter, "when i find my dream lady, if she will have an elastic imagination. </s>
<s> " "haven't you found her yet?" asked linda casually. </s>
<s>  "no," said peter, "i haven't found her, and unfortunately she hasn't found me. </s>
<s>  i have had a strenuous time getting my start in life. </s>
<s>  it's mostly a rush from one point of interest to another, dropping at any wayside station for refreshment and the use of a writing table. </s>
<s>  occasionally i have seen a vision that i have wanted to follow, but i never have had time. </s>
<s>  so far, the lady of this house is even more of a dream than the house. </s>
<s> " "oh, well, don't worry," said linda comfortingly. </s>
<s>  "the world is full of the nicest girls. </s>
<s>  when you get ready for a gracious lady i'll find you one that will have an india-rubber imagination and a great big loving heart and indian-hemp apron strings so that half a dozen babies can swing from them. </s>
<s> " morrison turned to henry anderson. </s>
<s>  "you hear, henry?" he said. </s>
<s>  "i am destined to have a large family. </s>
<s>  you must curtail your plans for the workroom and make that big room back of it into a nursery. </s>
<s> " "well, what i am going to do," said henry anderson, "is to build a place suitable for your needs. </s>
<s>  if any dream woman comes to it, she will have to fit herself to her environment. </s>
<s> " linda frowned. </s>
<s>  "now, that isn't a bit nice of you," she said, "and i don't believe peter will pay the slightest attention to you. </s>
<s>  he'll let me make you build a lovely room for the love of his heart, and a great big bright nursery on the sunny side for his small people. </s>
<s> " "i never believed," said henry anderson, "in counting your chickens before they are hatched. </s>
<s>  there are a couple of acres around peter's house, and he can build an addition as his needs increase. </s>
<s> " "messy idea," said linda promptly. </s>
<s>  "thing to do, when you build a house, is to build it the way you want it for the remainder of your life, so you don't have to tear up the scenery every few years, dragging in lumber for expansion. </s>
<s>  and i'll tell you another thing. </s>
<s>  if the homemakers of this country don't get the idea into their heads pretty soon that they are not going to be able to hold their own with the rest of the world, with no children, or one child in the family, there's a sad day of reckoning coming. </s>
<s>  with the records at the patent office open to the world, you can't claim that the brain of the white man is not constructive. </s>
<s>  you can look at our records and compare them with those of countries ages and ages older than we are, which never discovered the beauties of a dover egg-beater or a washing machine or a churn or a railroad or a steamboat or a bridge. </s>
<s>  we are head and shoulders above other nations in invention, and just as fast as possible, we are falling behind in the birth rate. </s>
<s>  the red man and the yellow man and the brown man and the black man can look at our egg-beaters and washing machines and bridges and big guns, and go home and copy them. </s>
<s>  and use them while rearing even bigger families than they have now. </s>
<s>  if every home in lilac valley had at least six sturdy boys and girls growing up in it with the proper love of country and the proper realization of the white man's right to supremacy, and if all the world now occupied by white men could make an equal record, where would be the talk of the yellow peril? there wouldn't be any yellow peril. </s>
<s>  you see what i mean?" linda lifted her frank eyes to peter morrison. </s>
<s>  "yes, young woman," said peter gravely, "i see what you mean, but this is the first time i ever heard a high-school kid propound such ideas. </s>
<s>  where did you get them?" "got them in multiflores canyon from my father to start with," said linda, "but recently i have been thinking, because there is a boy in high school who is making a great fight for a better scholarship record than a jap in his class. </s>
<s>  i brood over it every spare minute, day or night, and when i say my prayers i implore high heaven to send him an idea or to send me one that i can pass on to him, that will help him to beat that jap. </s>
<s> " "i see," said peter morrison. </s>
<s>  "we'll have to take time to talk this over. </s>
<s>  it's barely possible i might be able to suggest something. </s>
<s> " "you let that kid fight his own battles," said henry anderson roughly. </s>
<s>  "he is no proper bug-catcher. </s>
<s>  i feel it in my bones. </s>
<s> " for the first time, linda's joy laugh rang over peter morrison's possession. </s>
<s>  "i don't know about that," she said gaily. </s>
<s>  "he is a wide-awake specimen. </s>
<s>  he has led his class for four years when the jap didn't get ahead of him. </s>
<s>   all foolishness aside, take my word for it, peter, you'll be sorry if you don't build this house big enough for your dream lady and for all the little dreams that may spring from her heart. </s>
<s> " "nightmares, you mean," said henry anderson. </s>
<s>  "i can't imagine a bunch of kids muddying up this spring and breaking the bushes and using slingshots on the birds. </s>
<s> " "yes," said linda with scathing sarcasm, "and wouldn't our government be tickled to death to have a clear spring and a perfect bush and a singing bird, if it needed six men to go over the top to handle a regiment of japanese!" then peter morrison laughed. </s>
<s>  "well, your estimate is too low, linda," he said in his nicest drawling tone of voice. </s>
<s>  "believe me, one u. </s>
<s>  s. </s>
<s>  kid will never march in a whole regiment of japanese. </s>
<s>  they won't lay down their guns and walk to surrender as bunches of germans did. </s>
<s>  nobody need ever think that. </s>
<s>  they are as good fighters as they are imitators. </s>
<s>  there's nothing for you to do, henry, but to take to heart what miss linda has said. </s>
<s>  plan the house with a suite for a dream lady, and a dining room, a sleeping porch and a nursery big enough for the six children allotted to me. </s>
<s> " "you're not really in earnest?" asked henry anderson in doubting astonishment. </s>
<s>  "i am in the deepest kind of earnest," said peter morrison. </s>
<s>  "what miss linda says is true. </s>
<s>  as a nation, our people are pampering themselves and living for their own pleasures. </s>
<s>  they won't take the trouble or endure the pain required to bear and to rear children. </s>
<s>  and the day is rolling toward us, with every turn of the planet one day closer, when we are going to be outnumbered by a combination of peoples who can take our own tricks and beat us with them. </s>
<s>  we must pass along the good word that the one thing america needs above every other thing on earth is homes and hearts big enough for children, as were the homes of our grandfathers, when no joy in life equaled the joy of a new child in the family, and if you didn't have a dozen you weren't doing your manifest duty. </s>
<s> " "well, if that is the way you see the light, we must enlarge this house. </s>
<s>  as designed, it included every feminine convenience anyway. </s>
<s>  but when i build my house i am going to build it for myself. </s>
<s> " "then don't talk any more about being my bug-catcher," said linda promptly, "because when i build my house it's going to be a nest that will hold six at the very least. </s>
<s>  my heart is perfectly set on a brood of six. </s>
<s> " linda was quite unaware that the two men were studying her closely, but if she had known what was going on in their minds she would have had nothing to regret, because both of them found her very attractive, and both of them were wondering how anything so superficial as eileen could be of the same blood as linda. </s>
<s>  "are we keeping you too late?" inquired peter. </s>
<s>  "no," said linda, "i am as interested as i can be. </s>
<s>  finish everything you want to do before we go. </s>
<s>  i hope you're going to let me come over often and watch you with your building. </s>
<s>  maybe i can get an idea for some things i want to do. </s>
<s>  eileen and i have our house divided by a mason and dixon line. </s>
<s>  on her side is mother's suite, the dining room, the living room and the front door. </s>
<s>  on mine there's the garage and the kitchen and katy's bedroom and mine and the library and the billiard room. </s>
<s>  at the present minute i am interested in adapting the library to my requirements instead of father's, and i am emptying the billiard room and furnishing it to make a workroom. </s>
<s>  i have a small talent with a brush and pencil, and i need some bare walls to tack my prints on to dry, and i need numerous places for all the things i am always dragging in from the desert and the canyons. </s>
<s>  and since i have the bear cat running, what i have been doing in that line with a knapsack won't be worthy of mention. </s>
<s> " "how did it come," inquired henry anderson, "that you had that car jacked up so long?" "why, hasn't anybody told you," asked linda, "about our day of the black shadow?" "john gilman wrote me when it happened," said peter softly, "but i don't believe it has been mentioned before henry. </s>
<s>  you tell him. </s>
<s> " linda turned to henry anderson, and with trembling lips and paling cheeks, in a few brief sentences she gave him the details. </s>
<s>  then she said to peter morrison in a low voice: "and that is the why of marian thorne's white head. </s>
<s>  anybody tell you that?" "that white head puzzled me beyond anything i ever saw," he said. </s>
<s>  "i meant to ask john about it. </s>
<s>  he used to talk to me and write to me often about her, and lately he hasn't. </s>
<s>  when i came i saw the reason, and so you see i felt reticent on the subject. </s>
<s> " "well, there's nothing the matter with my tongue," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it's loose at both ends. </s>
<s>  marian was an expert driver. </s>
<s>  she drove with the same calm judgment and precision and graceful skill that she does everything else, but the curve was steep and something in the brakes was defective. </s>
<s>  it broke with a snap and there was not a thing she could do. </s>
<s>  enough was left of the remains of the car to prove that. </s>
<s>  ten days afterward her head was almost as white as snow. </s>
<s>  before that it was as dark as mine. </s>
<s>  but her body is just as young and her heart is just as young and her face is even more beautiful. </s>
<s>  i do think that a white crown makes her lovelier than she was before. </s>
<s>  i have known marian ever since i can remember, and i don't know one thing about her that i could not look you straight in the eye and tell you all about. </s>
<s>  there is not a subterfuge or an evasion or a small mean deceit in her soul. </s>
<s>  she is the brainiest woman and the biggest woman i know. </s>
<s> " "i haven't a doubt of it," said peter morrison. </s>
<s>  "and while you are talking about nice women, we met a mighty fine one at riverside on sunday. </s>
<s>  her name is mary louise whiting. </s>
<s>  do you know her?" "not personally," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i don't recall that i ever saw her. </s>
<s>  i know her brother, donald. </s>
<s>  he is the high-school boy who is having the wrestle with the jap. </s>
<s> " "i liked her too," said henry anderson. </s>
<s>  "and by the way, miss linda, haven't bug-catchers any reputation at all as nest builders? is it true that among feathered creatures the hen builds the home?" "no, it's not," said linda promptly. </s>
<s>  "male birds make a splendid record carrying nest material. </s>
<s>  what is true is that in the majority of cases the female does the building. </s>
<s> " "well, what i am getting at," said henry anderson, "is this. </s>
<s>  is there anything i can do to help you with that billiard room that you're going to convert to a workroom? what do you lack in it that you would like to have? do you need more light or air, or a fireplace, or what? when you take us to the station, suppose you drive us past your house and give me a look at that room and let me think over it a day or two. </s>
<s>  i might be able to make some suggestion that would help you. </s>
<s> " "now that is positively sweet of you," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i never thought of such a thing as either comfort or convenience. </s>
<s>  i thought i had to take that room as it stands and do the best i could with it, but since you mention it, it's barely possible that more air might be agreeable and also more light, and if there could be a small fireplace built in front of the chimney where it goes up from the library fireplace, it certainly would be a comfort, and it would add something to the room that nothing else could. </s>
<s>  "no workroom really has a soul if you can't smell smoke and see red when you go to it at night. </s>
<s> " "you little outdoor heathen," laughed peter morrison. </s>
<s>  "one would think you were an indian. </s>
<s> " "i am a fairly good indian," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i have been scouting around with my father a good many years. </s>
<s>  how about it, peter? does the road go crooked?" "yes," said peter, "the road goes crooked. </s>
<s> " "does the bed of the spring curve and sweep across the lawn and drop off to the original stream below the tree-tobacco clump there?" "if you say so, it does," said peter. </s>
<s>  "including the bridge?" inquired linda. </s>
<s>  "including the bridge," said peter. </s>
<s>  "i'll have to burn some midnight oil, but i can visualize the bridge. </s>
<s> " "and is this house where you 'set up your rest,' as you so beautifully said the other night at dinner, going to lay its corner stone and grow to its roof a selfish house, or is it going to be generous enough for a gracious lady and a flight of little footsteps?" peter morrison took off his hat. </s>
<s>  he turned his face toward the length of lilac valley and stood, very tall and straight, looking far away before him. </s>
<s>  presently he looked down at linda. </s>
<s>  "even so," he said softly. </s>
<s>  "my shoulders are broad enough. </s>
<s>  i have a brain. </s>
<s>  and i am not afraid to work. </s>
<s>  if my heart is not quite big enough yet, i see very clearly how it can be made to expand. </s>
<s> " "i have been told," said linda in a low voice, "that mary louise whiting is a perfect darling. </s>
<s> "  peter looked at her from the top of her black head to the tips of her brown shoes. </s>
<s>  he could have counted the freckles bridging her nose. </s>
<s>  the sunburn on her cheeks was very visible. </s>
<s>  there was something arresting in the depth of her eyes, the curve of her lips, the lithe slenderness of her young body. </s>
<s>  she gave the effect of something smoldering inside that would leap at a breath. </s>
<s>  "i was not thinking of miss whiting," he said soberly. </s>
<s>  henry anderson was watching. </s>
<s>  now he turned his back and commenced talking about plans, but in his heart he said: "so that's the lay of the land. </s>
<s>  you've got to hustle yourself, henry, or you won't have the ghost of a show. </s>
<s> " later, when they motored down the valley and stopped at the strong residence, peter refused to be monopolized by eileen. </s>
<s>  he climbed the two flights of stairs with henry anderson and linda and exhausted his fund of suggestions as to what could be done to that empty billiard room to make an attractive study of it. </s>
<s>  linda listened quietly to all their suggestions, and then she said: "it would be fine to have another window, and a small skylight would be a dream, and as for the fireplace you mention, i can't even conceive how great it would be to have that. </s>
<s>  but my purse is much more limited than peter's, and while i have my school work to do every day, my earning capacity is nearly negligible. </s>
<s>  i can only pick up a bit here and there with my brush and pencil -- place cards and easter cards and valentines, and once or twice magazine covers, and little things like that. </s>
<s>  i don't see my way clear to lumber and glass and bricks and chimney pieces. </s>
<s> " peter looked at henry, and henry looked at peter, and a male high sign, ancient as day, passed between them. </s>
<s>  "easiest thing in the world," said peter. </s>
<s>  "it's as sure as shooting that when my three or four fireplaces, which henry's present plans call for, are built, there is going to be all the material left that can be used in a light tiny fireplace such as could be built on a third floor, and when the figuring for the house is done it could very easily include the cutting of a skylight and an extra window or two here, and getting the material in with my stuff, it would cost you almost nothing. </s>
<s> " linda's eyes opened wide and dewy with surprise and pleasure. </s>
<s>  "why, you two perfectly nice men!" she said. </s>
<s>  "i haven't felt as i do this minute since i lost daddy. </s>
<s>  it's wonderful to be taken care of. </s>
<s>  it's better than cream puffs with almond flavoring. </s>
<s> " henry anderson looked at linda keenly. </s>
<s>  "you're the darndest kid!" he said. </s>
<s>  "one minute you're smacking your lips over cream puffs, and the next you're going to the bottom of the yellow peril. </s>
<s>  i never before saw your combination in one girl. </s>
<s>  what's the explanation?" for the second time that evening linda's specialty in rapture floated free. </s>
<s>  "bunch all the component parts into the one paramount fact that i am saturday's child," she said, "so i am constantly on the job of working for a living, and then add to that the fact that i was reared by a nerve specialist. </s>
<s> " then they went downstairs, and the men refused both eileen's and linda's invitation to remain for dinner. </s>
<s>  when they had gone eileen turned to linda with a discontented and aggrieved face. </s>
<s>  "in the name of all that's holy, what are you doing or planning to do?" she demanded. </s>
<s>  "not anything that will cost you a penny beyond my natural rights," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "that is not answering my question," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "you're not of age and you're still under the authority of a guardian. </s>
<s>  if you can't answer me, possibly you can him. </s>
<s>  shall i send john gilman to ask what i want to know of you?" "when did i ever ask you any questions about what you chose to do?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  "i am merely following the example that you have previously set me. </s>
<s>  john gilman and i used to be great friends. </s>
<s>  it might help both of us to have a family reunion. </s>
<s>  send him by all means. </s>
<s> " "you used to take pride," suggested eileen, "in leading your class. </s>
<s> " "and has anyone told you that i am not leading my class at the present minute?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  "no," said eileen, "but what i want to point out to you is that the minute you start running with the boys you will quit leading your class. </s>
<s> " "don't you believe it," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "i am not built that way. </s>
<s>  i shan't concentrate on any boy to the exclusion of chemistry and geometry, never fear it. </s>
<s> " then she thoughtfully ascended the stairs and went to work. </s>
<s>  eileen went to her room and sat down to think. </s>
<s>  and the more she thought, the deeper grew her anger and chagrin. </s>
<s>  and to the indifference that always had existed in her heart concerning linda was added in that moment a new element. </s>
<s>  she was jealous of her. </s>
<s>  how did it come that a lanky, gangling kid in her tees had been paid a visit by the son of possibly the most cultured and influential family of the city, people of prestige, comfortable wealth, and unlimited popularity? for four years she had struggled to gain an entrance in some way into louise whiting's intimate circle of friends, and she had ended by shutting the door on the only son of the family. </s>
<s>  and why had she ever allowed linda to keep the runabout? it was not proper that a young girl should own a high powered car like that. </s>
<s>  it was not proper that she should drive it and go racing around the country, heaven knew where, and with heaven knew whom. </s>
<s>  eileen bit her lip until it almost bled. </s>
<s>  her eyes were hateful and her hands were nervous as she reviewed the past week. </s>
<s>  she might think any mean thing that a mean brain could conjure up, but when she calmed down to facts she had to admit that there was not a reason in the world why linda should not drive the car she had driven for her father, or why she should not take with her donald whiting or peter morrison or henry anderson. </s>
<s>  the thing that rankled was that the car belonged to linda. </s>
<s>  the touring car which she might have owned and driven, had she so desired, lay in an extremely slender string of pearls around her neck at that instant. </s>
<s>  she reflected that if she had kept her car and made herself sufficiently hardy to drive it, she might have been the one to have taken peter morrison to his home location and to have had many opportunities for being with him. </s>
<s>  "i have been a fool," said eileen, tugging at the pearls viciously. </s>
<s>  "they are nothing but a little bit of a string that looks as if i were trying to do something and couldn't, at best. </s>
<s>  what i have got to do is to think more of myself. </s>
<s>  i have got to plan some way to prevent linda from being too popular until i really get my mind made up as to what i want to do. </s>
<s> " chapter xiii. </s>
<s>  leavening the bread of life "'a house that is divided against itself cannot st'" quoted linda. </s>
<s>  "i must keep in mind what eileen said, not that there is the slightest danger, but to fall behind in my grades is a thing that simply must not happen. </s>
<s>  if it be true that peter and henry can so easily and so cheaply add a few improvements in my workroom in connection with peter's building, i can see no reason why they shouldn't do it, so long as i pay for it. </s>
<s>  i haven't a doubt but that there will be something i can do for peter, before he finishes his building, that he would greatly appreciate, while, since i am handy with my pencil, i might be able to make a few head and tail pieces for some of his articles that would make them more attractive. </s>
<s>  i don't want to use any friend of mine: i don't want to feel that i am not giving quite as much as i get, but i think i see my way clear, between me and the bear cat, to pay for all the favors i would receive in altering my study. </s>
<s>  "first thing i do i must go through father's books and get the money for them, so i'll know my limitation when i come to select furniture. </s>
<s>  and i don't know that i am going to be so terribly modest when it comes to naming the sum with which i'll be satisfied for my allowance. </s>
<s>  possibly i shall exercise my age-old prerogative and change my mind. </s>
<s>  i may just say 'half' right out loud and stick to it. </s>
<s>  and there's another thing. </s>
<s>  since the editor of everybody's home has started my department and promised that if it goes well he will give it to me permanently, i can certainly depend on something from that. </s>
<s>  he has used my introduction and two instalments now. </s>
<s>  i should think it might be fair to talk payments pretty soon. </s>
<s>  he should give me fifty dollars for a recipe with its perfectly good natural history and embellished with my own vegetable and floral decorations. </s>
<s>  "in the meantime i think i might buy my worktable and possibly an easel, so i can have real room to spread out my new material and see how it would feel to do one drawing completely unhampered. </s>
<s>  i'll order the table tonight, and then i'll begin on the books, because i must have saturday free. </s>
<s>  and i must be thinking about the most attractive and interesting place i can take donald to. </s>
<s>  i just have to keep him interested until he gets going of his own accord, because he shall beat oka sayye. </s>
<s>  i wouldn't let donald say it but i don't mind saying myself to myself with no one present except myself that in all my life i have never seen anything so masklike as the stolid little square head on that jap. </s>
<s>  i have never seen anything i dislike more than the oily, stiff, black hair standing up on it like menacing bristles. </s>
<s>  i have never had but one straight look deep into his eyes, but in that look i saw the only thing that ever frightened me in looking into a man's eyes in my whole life. </s>
<s>  and there is one thing that i have to remember to caution donald about. </s>
<s>  he must carry on this contest in a perfectly open, fair, and aboveboard way, and he simply must not antagonize oka sayye. </s>
<s>  there are so many of the japs. </s>
<s>  they all look so much alike, and there's a blood brotherhood between them that will make them protect each other to the death against any white man. </s>
<s>  it wouldn't be safe for donald to make oka sayye hate him. </s>
<s>  he had far better try to make him his friend and put a spirit of honest rivalry into his heart. </s>
<s>  but come to think of it, there wasn't anything like that in my one look into oka sayye's eyes. </s>
<s>  i don't know what it was, but whatever it was it was something repulsive. </s>
<s> " with this thought in her mind linda walked slowly as she approached the high school the next time. </s>
<s>  far down the street, over the walks and across the grounds, her eyes were searching eagerly for the tall slender figure of donald whiting. </s>
<s>  she did not see him in the morning, but at noon she encountered him in the hall. </s>
<s>  "looking for you," he cried gaily when he saw her. </s>
<s>  "i have got my pry in on trig. </s>
<s>  the professor's interested. </s>
<s>  dad fished out an old trig that he used when he was a boy and i have some new angles that will keep my esteemed rival stirring up his gray matter for some little time. </s>
<s> " "good for you! joyous congratulations! you've got the idea!" cried linda. </s>
<s>  "go to it! start something all along the line, but make it something founded on brains and reason and common sense. </s>
<s>   donald, i was watching for you. </s>
<s>  i wanted to say a word. </s>
<s> " donald whiting bent toward her. </s>
<s>  the faintest suspicion of a tinge of color crept into his cheeks. </s>
<s>  "that's fine," he said. </s>
<s>  "what was it you wanted?" "only this," she said in almost a breathless whisper. </s>
<s>  "there is nothing in california i am afraid of except a jap, and i am afraid of them, not potentially, not on account of what all of us know they are planning in the backs of their heads for the future, but right here and now, personally and physically. </s>
<s>  don't antagonize oka sayye. </s>
<s>  don't be too precipitate about what you're trying to do. </s>
<s>  try to make it appear that you're developing ideas for the interest and edification of the whole class. </s>
<s>  don't incur his personal enmity. </s>
<s>  use tact. </s>
<s> " "you think i am afraid of that little jiu-jitsu?', he scoffed. </s>
<s>  "i can lick him with one hand. </s>
<s> "  "i haven't a doubt of it," said linda, measuring his height and apparent strength and fitness. </s>
<s>  "i haven't a doubt of it. </s>
<s>  but let me ask you this confidentially: have you got a friend who would slip in and stab him in the back in case you were in an encounter and he was getting the better of you?" donald whiting's eyes widened. </s>
<s>  he looked at linda amazed. </s>
<s>  "wouldn't that be going rather far?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "i think i have some fairly good friends among the fellows, but i don't know just whom i would want to ask to do me that small favor. </s>
<s> " "that is precisely the point," cried linda. </s>
<s>  "you haven't a friend you would ask. </s>
<s>  and you haven't a friend who would do it, if you did. </s>
<s>  but don't believe for one second that oka sayye hasn't half a dozen who would make away with you at an unexpected time and in a secluded place, and vanish, if it would in any way further oka sayye's ambition, or help establish the supremacy of the japanese in california. </s>
<s> " "um-hm," said donald whiting. </s>
<s>  he was looking far past linda and now his eyes were narrowed in thought. </s>
<s>  "i believe you're right about it. </s>
<s> " "i have thought of you so often since i tried to spur you to beat oka sayye," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i feel a sort of responsibility for you. </s>
<s>  it's to the honor and glory of all california, and the united states, and the white race everywhere for you to beat him, but if any harm should come to you i would always feel that i shouldn't have urged it. </s>
<s> " "now that's foolishness," said donald earnestly. </s>
<s>  "if i am such a dub that i didn't have the ambition to think up some way to beat a jap myself, no matter what happens you shouldn't regret having been the one to point out to me my manifest duty. </s>
<s>  dad is a harvard man, you know, and that is where he is going to send me, and in talking about it the other night i told him about you, and what you had said to me. </s>
<s>  he is the greatest old scout, and was mightily interested. </s>
<s>  he went at once and opened a box of books in the garret and dug out some stuff that will be a big help to me. </s>
<s>  he is going to keep posted and see what he can do. </s>
<s>  he said even worse things to me than you did. </s>
<s>  so you needn't feel that you have any responsibility. </s>
<s>  besides that, it's not proved yet that i can beat oka sayye. </s>
<s> " "yes, it is!" said linda, sending a straight level gaze deep into his eyes. </s>
<s>  "yes, it is! whenever a white man makes up his mind what he is going to do, and puts his brain to work, he beats any man, of any other color. </s>
<s>  sure you're going to beat him. </s>
<s> " "fat chance i have not to," said donald, laughing ruefully. </s>
<s>  "if i don't beat him i am disgraced at home, and with you. </s>
<s>  before i try very long in this highly specialized effort i am making, every professor in the high school and every member of my class is bound to become aware of what is going on. </s>
<s>  you're mighty right about it. </s>
<s>  i have got to beat him or disgrace myself right at the beginning of my nice young career. </s>
<s> " "of course you'll beat him," said linda. </s>
<s>  "at what hour did you say i should come, saturday?" "oh, come with the lark for all i care," said linda. </s>
<s>  "early morning in the desert is a mystery and a miracle, and the larks have been there just long enough to get their voices properly tuned for their purest notes. </s>
<s> " then she turned and hurried away. </s>
<s>  her first leisure minute after reaching home she went to the library wearing one of katy's big aprons, and carrying a brush and duster. </s>
<s>  beginning at one end of each shelf, she took down the volumes she intended to sell, carefully dusted them, wiped their covers, and the place on which they had stood, and then opened and leafed through them so that no scrap of paper containing any notes or memoranda of possible value should be overlooked. </s>
<s>  it was while handling these volumes that linda shifted several of the books written by her father, to separate them from those with which she meant to part. </s>
<s>  she had grown so accustomed to opening each book she handled and looking through it, that she mechanically opened the first one she picked up and from among its leaves there fell a scrap of loose paper. </s>
<s>  she picked it up and found it was a letter from the publishers of the book. </s>
<s>  linda's eyes widened suddenly as she read: my dear strong: sending you a line of congratulations. </s>
<s>  you have gone to the head of the list of "best sellers" among medical works, and the cheque i draw you for the past six months' royalties will be considerably larger than that which goes to your most esteemed contemporary on your chosen subject. </s>
<s>  very truly yours, the signature was that of frederic dickman, the editor of one of the biggest publishing houses of the country. </s>
<s>   "hm," she said to herself softly. </s>
<s>  "now that is a queer thing. </s>
<s>  that letter was written nearly five years ago. </s>
<s>  i don't know why i never thought of royalties since daddy went. </s>
<s>  i frequently heard him mention them before. </s>
<s>  i suppose they are being paid to john gilman as administrator, or to the consolidated bank, and cared for with father's other business. </s>
<s>  there's no reason why these books should not keep on selling. </s>
<s>  there are probably the same number of young men, if not a greater number, studying medicine every year. </s>
<s>  i wonder now, about these royalties. </s>
<s>  i must do some thinking. </s>
<s> " then linda began to examine books more carefully than before. </s>
<s>  the letter she carried with her when she went to her room. </s>
<s>  but she made a point of being on the lawn that evening when john gilman came, and after talking to him a few minutes, she said very casually: "john, as father's administrator, does a royalty from his medical books come to you?" "no," said gilman. </s>
<s>  "it is paid to his bank. </s>
<s> " "i don't suppose," said linda casually, "it would amount to enough to keep one in shoes these inflated days. </s>
<s> " "oh, i don't know about that," said john testily. </s>
<s>  "i have seen a few of those cheques in your father's time. </s>
<s>  you should be able to keep fairly well supplied with shoes. </s>
<s> " "so i should," said linda drily. </s>
<s>  "so i should. </s>
<s> " then she led him to the back of the house and talked the incident out of his mind as cleverly as possible by giving him an intensive botanical study of cotyledon. </s>
<s>  but she could not interest him quite so deeply as she had hoped, for presently he said: "eileen tells me that you're parting with some of the books. </s>
<s> " "only technical ones for which i could have no possible use," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i need clothes, and have found that had i a proper place to work in and proper tools to work with, i could earn quite a bit with my brush and pencil, and so i am trying to get enough money together to fit up the billiard room for a workroom, since nobody uses it for anything else. </s>
<s> " "i see," said john gilman. </s>
<s>  "i suppose running a house is extremely expensive these days, but even so the income from your estate should be sufficient to dress a schoolgirl and provide for anything you would want in the way of furnishing a workroom. </s>
<s> " "that's what i have always thought myself," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but eileen doesn't agree with me, and she handles the money. </s>
<s>  when the first of the month comes, we are planning to go over things together, and she is going to make me a proper allowance. </s>
<s> " "that is exactly as it should be," said gilman. </s>
<s>  "i never realized till the other night at dinner that you have grown such a great girl, linda. </s>
<s>  that's fine! fix your workroom the way you would like to have it, and if there's anything i can do to help you in any way, you have only to command me. </s>
<s>  i haven't seen you often lately. </s>
<s> " "no," said linda, "but i don't feel that it is exactly my fault. </s>
<s>  marian and i were always pals. </s>
<s>  when i saw that you preferred eileen, i kept with marian to comfort her all i could. </s>
<s>  i don't suppose she cared, particularly. </s>
<s>  she couldn't have, or she would at least have made some effort to prevent eileen from monopolizing you. </s>
<s>  she probably was mighty glad to be rid of you. </s>
<s>  but since you had been together so much, i thought she might miss you, so i tried to cover your defection. </s>
<s> " john gilman's face flushed. </s>
<s>  he stood very still, while he seemed deeply thoughtful. </s>
<s>  "of course you were free to follow your inclinations, or eileen's machinations, whichever you did follow," linda said lightly, "but 'them as knows' could tell you, john, as katy so well puts it, that you have made the mistake of your young life. </s>
<s> " then she turned and went to the garage, leaving john to his visit with eileen. </s>
<s>  the eileen who took possession of john was an eileen with whom he was not acquainted. </s>
<s>  he had known, the night of the dinner party, that eileen was pouting, but there had been no chance to learn from her what her grievance was, and by the next time they met she was a bundle of flashing allurement, so he ignored the occurrence. </s>
<s>  this evening, for the first time, it seemed to him that eileen was not so beautiful a woman as he had thought her. </s>
<s>  something had roiled the blood in her delicate veins until it had muddied the clear freshness of her smooth satiny skin. </s>
<s>  there was discontent in her eyes, which were her most convincing attraction. </s>
<s>  they were big eyes, wide open and candid. </s>
<s>  she had so trained them through a lifetime of practice that she could meet other eyes directly while manipulating her most dextrous evasion. </s>
<s>  whenever eileen was most deceptively subtle, she was looking straight at her victim with the innocent appeal of a baby in her gaze. </s>
<s>  john gilman had had his struggle. </s>
<s>  he had succeeded. </s>
<s>  he had watched, and waited, and worked incessantly, and when his opportunity came he was ready. </s>
<s>  success had come to such a degree that in a short time he had assured himself of comfort for any woman he loved. </s>
<s>  he knew that his appearance was quite as pleasing as that of his friend. </s>
<s>  he knew that in manner and education they were equals. </s>
<s>  he was now handling large business affairs. </s>
<s>  he had made friends in high places. </s>
<s>  whenever eileen was ready, he would build and furnish a home he felt sure would be equal, if not superior, to what morrison was planning. </s>
<s>  why had eileen felt that she would envy any woman who shared life with peter morrison? all that day she had annoyed him, because there must have been in the very deeps of his soul "a still, small voice" whispering to him that he had not lived up to the best traditions of a gentleman in his course with marian. </s>
<s>  while no definite plans had been made, there had been endless assumption. </s>
<s>  many times they had talked of the home they would make together. </s>
<s>  when he reached the point where he decided that he never had loved marian as a man should love the woman he marries, he felt justified in turning to eileen, but in his heart he knew that if he had been the man he was pleased to consider himself, he would have gone to marian thorne and explained, thereby keeping her friendship, while he now knew that he must have earned her contempt. </s>
<s>  the day at riverside had been an enigma he could not solve. </s>
<s>  eileen was gay to a degree that was almost boisterous. </s>
<s>  she had attracted attention and comment which no well-bred woman would have done. </s>
<s>  the growing discontent in john's soul had increased under linda's direct attack. </s>
<s>  he had known linda since she was four years old and had been responsible for some of her education. </s>
<s>  he had been a large influence in teaching linda from childhood to be a good sport, to be sure she was right and then go ahead, and if she hurt herself in the going, to rub the bruise, but to keep her path. </s>
<s>  a thing patent to the eye of every man who turned an appraising look upon linda always had been one of steadfast loyalty. </s>
<s>  you could depend upon her. </s>
<s>  she was the counterpart of her father. </s>
<s>  and doctor strong had been loved by other men. </s>
<s>  wherever he had gone he had been surrounded. </s>
<s>  his figure had been one that attracted attention. </s>
<s>  when he had spoken, his voice and what he had to say had commanded respect. </s>
<s>  and then there had emanated from him that peculiar physical charm which gives such pleasing and distinguished personality to a very few people in this world. </s>
<s>  this gift too had descended to linda. </s>
<s>  she could sit and look straight at you with her narrow, interested eyes, smile faintly, and make you realize what she thought and felt without opening her lips. </s>
<s>  john did not feel very well acquainted with the girl who had dominated the recent dinner party, but he did see that she was attractive, that both peter morrison and henry anderson had been greatly amused and very much entertained by her. </s>
<s>  he had found her so interesting himself that he had paid slight attention to eileen's pouting. </s>
<s>  tonight he was forced to study eileen, for the sake of his own comfort to try to conciliate her. </s>
<s>  he was uncomfortable because he was unable to conduct himself as eileen wished him to, without a small sickening disgust creeping into his soul. </s>
<s>  before the evening was over he became exasperated, and ended by asking flatly: "eileen, what in the dickens is the matter with you?" it was a new tone and a new question on nerves tensely strung. </s>
<s>  "if you weren't blind you'd know without asking," retorted eileen hotly. </s>
<s>  "then i am 'blind,' for i haven't the slightest notion. </s>
<s>  what have i done?" "isn't it just barely possible," asked eileen, "that there might be other people who would annoy and exasperate me? i have not hinted that you have done anything, although i don't know that it's customary for a man calling on his betrothed to stop first for a visit with her sister. </s>
<s> " "for the love of mike!" said john gilman. </s>
<s>  "am i to be found fault with for crossing the lawn a minute to see how linda's wild garden is coming on? i have dug and helped set enough of those plants to justify some interest in them as they grow. </s>
<s> " "and the garden was your sole subject of conversation?" inquired eileen, implied doubt conveyed nicely. </s>
<s>  "no, it was not," answered gilman, all the bulldog in his nature coming to the surface. </s>
<s>  "as i knew perfectly," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "i admit that i am not feeling myself. </s>
<s>  things began going wrong recently, and everything has gone wrong since. </s>
<s>  i think it all began with marian thorne's crazy idea of selling her home and going to the city to try to ape a man. </s>
<s> " "marian never tried to ape a man in her life," said john, instantly yielding to a sense of justice. </s>
<s>  "she is as strictly feminine as any woman i ever knew. </s>
<s> " "do you mean to say that you think studying architecture is a woman's work?" sneered eileen. </s>
<s>  "yes, i do," said gilman emphatically. </s>
<s>  "women live in houses. </s>
<s>  they are in them nine tenths of the time to a man's one tenth. </s>
<s>  next to rocking a cradle i don't know of any occupation in this world more distinctly feminine than the planning of comfortable homes for homekeeping people. </s>
<s> " eileen changed the subject swiftly. </s>
<s>  "what was linda saying to you?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "she was showing me a plant, a rare echeveria of the cotyledon family, that she tobogganed down one side of multiflores canyon and delivered safely on the roadway without its losing an appreciable amount of 'bloom' from its exquisitely painted leaves. </s>
<s> " eileen broke in rudely. </s>
<s>  "linda has missed marian. </s>
<s>  there's not a possible thing to make life uncomfortable for me that she is not doing. </s>
<s>  you needn't tell me you didn't see and understand her rude forwardness the other night!" "no, i didn't see it," said john, "because the fact is i thought the kid was positively charming, and so did peter and henry because both of them said so. </s>
<s>  there's one thing you must take into consideration, eileen. </s>
<s>  the time has come when she should have clothes and liberty and opportunity to shape her life according to her inclinations. </s>
<s>  let me tell you she will attract attention in georgette and laces. </s>
<s> " "and where are the georgette and laces to come from?" inquired eileen sarcastically. </s>
<s>  "all outgo and no income for four years is leaving the strong finances in mighty precarious shape, i can tell you. </s>
<s> " "all right," said gilman, "i am financially comfortable now. </s>
<s>  i am ready. </s>
<s>  say the word. </s>
<s>  we'll select our location and build our home, and let linda have what there is of the strong income till she is settled in life. </s>
<s>  you have pretty well had all of it for the past four years. </s>
<s> " "yes," said eileen furiously, "i have 'pretty well' had it, in a few little dresses that i have altered myself and very frequently made entirely. </s>
<s>  i have done the best i could, shifting and skimping, and it's not accomplished anything that i have really wanted. </s>
<s>  according to men, the gas and the telephone and the electric light and the taxes and food and cook pay for themselves. </s>
<s>  all a woman ever spends money on is clothes!" "eileen," chuckled john gilman, "this sounds exactly as if we were married, and we're not, yet. </s>
<s> " "no," said eileen, "thank heaven we're not. </s>
<s>  if it's come to the place where you're siding with everybody else against me, and where you're more interested in what my kid sister has to say to you than you are in me, i don't think we ever shall be. </s>
<s> "  then, from stress of nerve tension and long practice, some big tears gushed up and threatened to overflow eileen's lovely eyes. </s>
<s>  that never should happen, for tears are salt water and they cut little rivers through even the most carefully and skillfully constructed complexion, while eileen's was looking its worst that evening. </s>
<s>  she hastily applied her handkerchief, and john gilman took her into his arms. </s>
<s>  so the remainder of the evening it was as if they were not married. </s>
<s>  but when john returned to the subject of a home and begged eileen to announce their engagement and let him begin work, she evaded him, and put him off, and had to have time to think, and she was not ready, and there were many excuses, for none of which gilman could see any sufficient reason. </s>
<s>  when he left eileen that night, it was with a heavy heart. </s>
<s>  chapter xiv. </s>
<s>  saturday's child throughout the week linda had worked as never during her life previously, in order to save saturday for donald whiting. </s>
<s>  she ran the bear cat down to the garage and had it looked over once more to be sure that everything was all right. </s>
<s>  friday evening, on her way from school, she stopped at a grocery where she knew eileen kept an account, and for the first time ordered a few groceries. </s>
<s>  these she carried home with her, and explained to katy what she wanted. </s>
<s>  katy fully realized that linda was still her child, with no thought in her mind save standing at the head of her classes, carrying on the work she had begun with her father, keeping up her nature study, and getting the best time she could out of life in the open as she had been taught to do from her cradle. </s>
<s>  katy had not the slightest intention of opening her lips to say one word that might put any idea into the head of her beloved child, but she saw no reason why she herself should not harbor all the ideas she pleased. </s>
<s>  whereupon, actuated by a combination of family pride, love, ambition in her chosen profession, katy made ready to see that on the morrow the son of frederick whiting should be properly nourished on his outing with linda. </s>
<s>  at six o'clock saturday morning linda ran the bear cat to the back door, where she and katy packed it. </s>
<s>  before they had finished, donald whiting came down the sidewalk, his cheeks flushed with the exercise of walking, his eyes bright with anticipation, his cause forever won--in case he had a cause--with katy, because she liked the wholesome, hearty manner in which he greeted linda, and she was dumbfounded when he held out his hand to her and said laughingly: "blessed among women, did you put in a fine large consignment of orange punch?" "no," said katy, "i'll just tell ye flat-footed there ain't going to be any punch,  young sir, you're eshcortin' a very capable young lady, and don't ye bewail the punch, because ye might be complimenting your face with something ye would like a hape better. </s>
<s> " "can't be done, katy," cried donald. </s>
<s>  "ye must have a poor opinion of us," laughed katy, "if ye are thinking ye can get to the end of our limitations in one lunch. </s>
<s>  fourteen years me and miss linda's been on this lunch-box stunt. </s>
<s>  don't ye be thinkin' ye can exhaust us in any wan trip, or in any wan dozen. </s>
<s> " so they said good-bye to katy and rolled past eileen's room on the way to the desert. </s>
<s>  eileen stood at the window watching them, and never had her heart been so full of discontent and her soul the abiding place of such envy or her mind so busy. </s>
<s>  just when she had thought life was going to yield her what she craved, she could not understand how or why things should begin to go wrong. </s>
<s>  as the bear cat traversed lilac valley, linda was pointing out peter morrison's location. </s>
<s>  she was telling donald whiting where to find peter's articles, and what a fine man he was, and that he had promised to think how he could help with their plan to make of donald a better scholar than was oka sayye. </s>
<s>  "well, i call that mighty decent of a stranger," said donald. </s>
<s>  "but he is scarcely more of a stranger than i am," answered linda. </s>
<s>  "he is a writer. </s>
<s>  he is interested in humanity. </s>
<s>  it's the business of every man in this world to reach out and help every boy with whom he comes in contact into the biggest, finest manhood possible. </s>
<s>  he only knows that you're a boy tackling a big job that means much to every white boy to have you succeed with, and for that reason he is just as interested as i am. </s>
<s>  maybe, when we come in this evening, i'll run up to his place, and you can talk it over with him. </s>
<s>  if your father helped you at one angle, it's altogether probable that peter morrison could help you at another. </s>
<s> " donald whiting rubbed his knee reflectively. </s>
<s>  he was sitting half turned in the wide seat so that he might watch linda's hands and her face while she drove. </s>
<s>  "well, that's all right," he said heartily. </s>
<s>  "you can write me down as willing and anxious to take all the help i can get, for it's going to be no microscopic job, that i can tell you. </s>
<s>  one week has waked up the jap to the fact that there's something doing, and he is digging in and has begun, the last day or two, to speak up in class and suggest things himself. </s>
<s>  since i have been studying him and watching him, i have come to the conclusion that he is much older than i am. </s>
<s>  something he said in class yesterday made me think he had probably had the best schooling japan could give him before he came here. </s>
<s>  the next time you meet him look for a suspicion of gray hairs around his ears. </s>
<s>  he is too blamed comprehensive for the average boy of my age. </s>
<s>  you said the japs were the best imitators in the world and i have an idea in the back of my head that before i get through with him, oka sayye is going to prove your proposition. </s>
<s> " linda nodded as she shot the bear cat across the streetcar tracks and headed toward the desert. </s>
<s>  the engine was purring softly as it warmed up. </s>
<s>  the car was running smoothly. </s>
<s>  the sun of early morning was shining on them through bracing, salt, cool air, and even in the valley the larks were busy, and the mockingbirds, and from every wayside bush the rosy finches were singing. </s>
<s>  all the world was coming to the exquisite bloom of a half-tropical country. </s>
<s>  up from earth swept the heavy odors of blooming citrus orchards, millions of roses, and the overpowering sweetness of gardens and cultivated flowers. </s>
<s>  while down from the mountains rolled the delicate breath of the misty blue lilac, the pungent odor of california sage, and the spicy sweet of the lemonade bush. </s>
<s>  they were two young things, free for the day, flying down a perfect road, adventuring with providence. </s>
<s>  they had only gone a few miles when donald whiting took off his hat, stuffed it down beside him, and threw back his head, shaking his hair to the wind in a gesture so soon to become familiar to linda. </s>
<s>  she glanced across at him and found him looking at her. </s>
<s>  a smile broke over her lips. </s>
<s>  one of her most spontaneous laughs bubbled up in her throat. </s>
<s>  "topping, isn't it!" she cried gaily. </s>
<s>  "it's the best thing that ever happened to me," answered donald whiting instantly. </s>
<s>  "our car is a mighty good one and dad isn't mean about letting me drive it. </s>
<s>  i can take it frequently and can have plenty of gas and take my crowd. </s>
<s>  but lordy, i don't believe there's a boy or girl living that doesn't just positively groan when they see one of these little gray bear cats go loping past. </s>
<s>  and i never even had a ride in one before. </s>
<s>  i can't get over the fact that it's yours. </s>
<s>  it wouldn't seem so funny if it belonged to one of the fellows. </s>
<s> " with steady hand and gradually increasing speed, linda put the bear cat over the roads of early morning. </s>
<s>  sometimes she stopped in the shade of pepper, eucalyptus, or palm, where the larks were specializing in their age-old offertory. </s>
<s>  and then again they went racing until they reached the real desert. </s>
<s>  linda ran the car under the shade of a tall clump of bloom-whitened alders. </s>
<s>  she took off her hat, loosened the hair at her temples, and looked out across the long morning stretch of desert. </s>
<s>  "it's just beginning to be good," she said. </s>
<s>  she began pointing with her slender hand. </s>
<s>  "that gleam you see over there is the gold of a small clump of early poppies. </s>
<s>  the purple beyond it is lupin. </s>
<s>  all these exquisite colors on the floor are birds'-eyes and baby blue eyes, and the misty white here and there is forget-me-not. </s>
<s>  it won't be long til thousands and thousands of yucca plants will light their torches all over the desert and all the alders show their lacy mist. </s>
<s>  of course you know how exquisitely the spaniards named the yucca 'our lord's candles. </s>
<s> ' isn't that the prettiest name for a flower, and isn't it the prettiest thought?" "it certainly is," answered donald. </s>
<s>  "had any experience with the desert?" linda asked lightly. </s>
<s>  "hunted sage hens some," answered donald. </s>
<s>  "oh, well, that'll be all right," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i wondered if you'd go murdering yourself like a tenderfoot. </s>
<s> " "what's the use of all this artillery?" inquired donald as he stepped from the car. </s>
<s>  "better put on your hat. </s>
<s>  you're taller than most of the bushes. </s>
<s>  you'll find slight shade," cautioned linda. </s>
<s>  "the use is purely a matter of self-protection. </s>
<s>  the desert has got such a devil of a fight for existence, without shade and practically without water, that it can't afford to take any other chance of extermination, and so it protects itself with needles here and spears there and sabers at other places and roots that strike down to china everywhere. </s>
<s>  first thing we are going to get is some soap. </s>
<s> " "great hat!" exclaimed donald. </s>
<s>  "if you wanted soap why didn't you bring some?" "for all you know," laughed linda, "i may be going to education you up a little. </s>
<s>  dare you to tell me how many kinds of soap i can find today that the indians used, and where i can find it. </s>
<s> " "couldn't tell you one to save my life," said donald. </s>
<s>  "and born and reared within a few miles of the desert!" scoffed linda. </s>
<s>  "nice indian you'd make. </s>
<s>  we take our choice today between finding deer-brush and digging for amole, because the mock oranges aren't ripe enough to be nice and soapy yet. </s>
<s>  i have got the deer-brush spotted, and we'll pass an amole before we go very far. </s>
<s>  look for a wavy blue-green leaf like a wide blade of grass and coming up like a lily. </s>
<s> " so together they went to the deer-brush and gathered a bunch of flowers that linda bound together with some wiry desert grass and fastened to her belt. </s>
<s>  it was not long before donald spied an amole, and having found one, discovered many others growing near. </s>
<s>  then linda led the way past thorns and brush, past impenetrable beds of cholla, until they reached a huge barrel cactus that she had located with the glasses. </s>
<s>  beside this bristling monstrous growth linda paused, and reached for the axe, which donald handed to her. </s>
<s>  she drew it lightly across the armor protecting the plant. </s>
<s>  "short of victrola needles?" she inquired. </s>
<s>  "because if you are, these make excellent ones. </s>
<s>  a lot more singing quality to them than the steel needles, not nearly so metallic. </s>
<s> " "well, i am surely going to try that," said donald. </s>
<s>  "never heard of such a thing. </s>
<s> " linda chopped off a section of plant. </s>
<s>  then she picked one of the knives from the bucket and handed it to him. </s>
<s>  "all right, you get what you want," she said, "while i operate on the barrel. </s>
<s> " she set her feet firmly in the s swung the axe, and with a couple of deft strokes sliced off the top of the huge plant, and from the heart of it lifted up half a bucketful of the juicy interior, with her dipper. </s>
<s>  "if we didn't have drink, here is where we would get it, and mighty good it is," she said, pushing down with the dipper until she formed a small pool in the heart of the plant which rapidly filled. </s>
<s>  "have a taste. </s>
<s> " "jove, that is good!" said donald. </s>
<s>  "what are you going to do with it?" "show you later," laughed linda. </s>
<s>  "think i'll take a sip myself. </s>
<s> " then by a roundabout route they started on their return to the car. </s>
<s>  once linda stopped and gathered a small bunch of an extremely curious little plant spreading over the ground, a tiny reddish vine with quaint round leaves that looked as if a drop of white paint rimmed with maroon had fallen on each of them. </s>
<s>  "i never saw that before," said donald. </s>
<s>  "what are you going to do with it?" "use it on whichever of us gets the first snake bite," said linda. </s>
<s>  "that is rattlesnake weed and if a poisonous snake bites you, score each side of the wound with the cleanest, sharpest knife you have and then bruise the plant and bind it on with your handkerchief, and forget it. </s>
<s> " "is that what you do?" inquired donald. </s>
<s>  "why sure," said linda, "that is what i would do if a snake were so ungallant as to bite me, but there doesn't seem to be much of the antagonistic element in my nature. </s>
<s>  i don't go through the desert exhaling the odor of fright, and so snakes lie quiescent or slip away so silently that i never see them. </s>
<s> " "now what on earth do you mean by that?" inquired donald. </s>
<s>  "why that is the very first lesson daddy ever taught me when he took me to the mountains and the desert. </s>
<s>  if you are afraid, your system throws off formic acid, and the animals need only the suspicion of a scent of it to make them ready to fight. </s>
<s>  any animal you encounter or even a bee, recognizes it. </s>
<s>  one of the first things that i remember about daddy was seeing him sit on the running board of the runabout buckling up his desert boots while he sang to me,  'let not your heart be troubled  neither let it be afraid,' as he got ready to take me on his back and go into the desert for our first lesson. </s>
<s>  he told me that a man was perfectly safe in going to the forest or the desert or anywhere he chose among any kind of animals if he had sufficient self-control that no odor of fear emanated from him. </s>
<s>  he said that a man was safe to make his way anywhere he wanted to go, if he started his journey by recognizing a blood brotherhood with anything living he would meet on the way. </s>
<s>  and i have heard enos mills say that when he was snow inspector of colorado he traveled the crest of the rockies from one end of the state to the other without a gun or any means of self-defense. </s>
<s> "  "now, that is something new to think about," said donald. </s>
<s>  "and it's something that is very true," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i have seen it work times without number. </s>
<s>  father and i went quietly up the mountains, through the canyons, across the desert, and we would never see a snake of any kind, but repeatedly we would see men with guns and dogs out to kill, to trespass on the rights of the wild, and they would be hunting for sticks and clubs and firing their guns where we had passed never thinking of lurking danger. </s>
<s>  if you start out in accord, at one with nature, you're quite as safe as you are at home, sometimes more so. </s>
<s>  but if you start out to stir up a fight, the occasion is very rare on which you can't succeed. </s>
<s> " "and that reminds me," said donald, with a laugh, "that a week ago i came to start a fight with you. </s>
<s>  what has become of that fight we were going to have, anyway?" "you can search me," laughed linda, throwing out her hands in a graceful gesture. </s>
<s>  "there's not a scrap of fight in my system concerning you, but if oka sayye were having a fight with you and i were anywhere around, you'd have one friend who would help you to handle the jap. </s>
<s> " donald looked at linda thoughtfully. </s>
<s>  "by the great hocus-pocus," he said, "you know, i believe you. </s>
<s>  if two fellows were having a pitched battle most of the girls i know would quietly faint or run, but i do believe that you would stand by and help a fellow if he needed it. </s>
<s> " "that i surely would," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but don't you say 'most of the girls i know' and then make a statement like that concerning girls, because you prove that you don't know them at all. </s>
<s>  a few years ago, i very distinctly recall how angry many women were at this line in one of kipling's poems: the female of the species is more deadly than the male, and there was nothing to it save that a great poet was trying to pay womanhood everywhere the finest compliment he knew how. </s>
<s>  he always has been fundamental in his process of thought. </s>
<s>  he gets right back to the heart of primal things. </s>
<s>  when he wrote that line he was not really thinking that there was a nasty poison in the heart of a woman or death in her hands. </s>
<s>  what he was thinking was that in the jungle the female lion or tiger or jaguar must go and find a particularly secluded cave and bear her young and raise them to be quite active kittens before she leads them out, because there is danger of the bloodthirsty father eating them when they are tiny and helpless. </s>
<s>  and if perchance a male finds the cave of his mate and her tiny young and enters it to do mischief, then there is no recorded instance i know of in which the female, fighting in defense of her young, has not been 'more deadly than the male. </s>
<s> ' and that is the origin of the much-discussed line concerning the female of the species, and it holds good fairly well down the line of the wild. </s>
<s>  it's even true among such tiny things as guinea pigs and canary birds. </s>
<s>  there is a mother element in the heart of every girl. </s>
<s>  daddy used to say that half the women in the world married the men they did because they wanted to mother them. </s>
<s>  you can't tell what is in a woman's heart by looking at her. </s>
<s>  you must bring her face to face with an emergency before you can say what she'll do, but i would be perfectly willing to stake my life on this: there is scarcely a girl you know who would see you getting the worst of a fight, say with oka sayye, or someone who meant to kill you or injure you, who would not pick up the first weapon she could lay her hands on, whether it was an axe or a stick or a stone, and go to your defense, and if she had nothing else to fight with, i have heard of women who put up rather a tidy battle with their claws. </s>
<s>  sounds primitive, doesn't it?" "it sounds true," said donald reflectively. </s>
<s>  "i see, young lady, where one is going to have to measure his words and think before he talks to you. </s>
<s> " "pretty thought!" said linda lightly. </s>
<s>  "we'll have a great time if you must stop to consider every word before you say it. </s>
<s> " "well, anyway," said donald, "when are we going to have that fight which was the purpose of our coming together?" "why, we're not ever going to have it," answered linda. </s>
<s>  "i have got nothing in this world to fight with you about since you're doing your level best to beat oka sayye. </s>
<s>  i have watched your head above the remainder of your class for three years and wanted to fight with you on that point. </s>
<s> " "now that's a queer thing," said donald, "because i have watched you for three years and wanted to fight with you about your drygoods, and now since i have known you only such a short while, i don't care two whoops what you wear. </s>
<s>  it's a matter of perfect indifference to me. </s>
<s>  you can wear french heels or baby pumps, or go barefoot. </s>
<s>  you would still be you. </s>
<s> " "is it a truce?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  i "no, ma'am," said donald, "it's not a truce. </s>
<s>  that implies war and we haven't fought. </s>
<s>  it's not armed neutrality. </s>
<s>  it's not even watchful waiting. </s>
<s>  it's my friend, linda strong. </s>
<s>  me for her and her for me, if you say so. </s>
<s> " he reached out his hand. </s>
<s>  linda laid hers in it, and looking into his eyes, she said: "that is a compact. </s>
<s>  we'll test this friendship business and see what there is to it. </s>
<s>  now come on. </s>
<s>  let's run for the canyon. </s>
<s> " it was only a short time until the bear cat followed its trail of the previous saturday,  rushing across the stream, stopped at its former resting place, while linda and donald sat looking at the sheer-walled little room before them. </s>
<s>  "i can see," said linda, "a stronger tinge in the green. </s>
<s>  there are more flowers in the carpet. </s>
<s>  there is more melody in the birds' song. </s>
<s>  we are going to have a better time than we had last saturday. </s>
<s>  first let's fix up our old furnace, because we must have a fire today. </s>
<s> " so they left the car, and under linda's direction they reconstructed the old fireplace at which the girl and her father had cooked when botanizing in multiflores. </s>
<s>  in a corner secluded from wind, using the wall of the canyon for a back wall, big boulders the right distance apart on each side, and small stones for chinking, linda superintended the rebuilding of the fireplace. </s>
<s>  she unpacked the lunch box, set the table, and when she had everything in readiness she covered the table, and taking a package, she carried it on a couple of aluminium pie pans to where her fire was burning crisply. </s>
<s>  with a small field axe she chopped a couple of small green branches, pointed them to her liking, and peeled them. </s>
<s>  then she made a poker from one of the saplings they had used to move the rocks, and beat down her fire until she had a bright bed of deep coals. </s>
<s>  when these were arranged exactly to her satisfaction, she pulled some sprays of deer weed bloom from her bundle  going down to the creek, made a lather and carefully washed her hands, tucking the towel she used in drying them through her belt. </s>
<s>  then she came back to the fire  sitting down beside it, opened the package and began her operations. </s>
<s>  on the long, slender sticks she strung a piece of tenderloin beef, about three inches in circumference and one fourth of an inch in thickness, then half a slice of bacon, and then a slice of onion. </s>
<s>  this she repeated until her skewer would bear no more weight. </s>
<s>  then she laid it across the rocks walling her fire, occasionally turning it while she filled the second skewer. </s>
<s>  then she brought from the car the bucket of pulp she had taken from the barrel cactus, transferred it to a piece of cheesecloth and deftly extracted the juice. </s>
<s>  to this she added the contents of a thermos bottle containing a pint of sugar that had been brought to the boiling point with a pint of water and poured over some chopped spearmint to which had been added the juice of half a dozen lemons and three or four oranges. </s>
<s>  from a small, metal-lined compartment, linda took a chunk of ice and dropped it into this mixture. </s>
<s>  she was sitting on the ground, one foot doubled under her, the other extended. </s>
<s>  she had taken off her hat. </s>
<s>  the wind and the bushes had roughened her hair. </s>
<s>  exercise had brought deep red to her cheeks and her lips. </s>
<s>  happiness had brought a mellow glow to her dark eyes. </s>
<s>  she had turned back her sleeves, and her slender hands were fascinatingly graceful in their deft handling of everything she touched. </s>
<s>  they were a second edition of the hands with which alexander strong had felt out defective nerve systems and made delicate muscular adjustments. </s>
<s>  she was wholly absorbed in what she was doing. </s>
<s>  sitting on the blanket across from her donald whiting was wholly absorbed in her and he was thinking. </s>
<s>  he was planning how he could please her, how he could earn her friendship. </s>
<s>  he was admitting to himself that he had very little, if anything, to show for hours of time that he had spent in dancing, at card games, beach picnics, and races. </s>
<s>  all these things had been amusing. </s>
<s>  but he had nothing to show for the time he had spent or the money he had wasted. </s>
<s>  nothing had happened that in any way equipped him for his battle with oka sayye. </s>
<s>  conversely, this girl, whom he had resented, whom he had criticized, who had claimed his notice only by her radical difference from the other girls, had managed, during the few minutes he had first talked with her in the hall, to wound his pride, to spur his ambition, to start him on a course that must end in lasting and material benefit to him even if he failed in making a higher record of scholarship than oka sayye. </s>
<s>  it was very certain that the exercise he was giving his brain must be beneficial. </s>
<s>  he had learned many things that were intensely interesting to him and he had not even touched the surface of what he could see that she had been taught by her father or had learned through experience and personal investigation. </s>
<s>  she had been coming to the mountains and the canyons alone, for four years doing by herself what she would have done under her father's supervision had he lived. </s>
<s>  that argued for steadfastness and strength of character. </s>
<s>  she would not utter one word of flattery. </s>
<s>  she would say nothing she did not mean. </s>
<s>  watching her intently, donald whiting thought of all these things. </s>
<s>  he thought of what she had said about fighting for him, and he wondered if it really was true that any girl he knew would fight for him. </s>
<s>  he hardly believed it when he remembered some of his friends, so entirely devoted to personal adornment and personal gratification. </s>
<s>  but linda had said that all women were alike in their hearts. </s>
<s>  she knew about other things. </s>
<s>  she must know about this. </s>
<s>  maybe all women would fight for their young or for their men, but he knew of no other girl who could drive a bear cat with the precision and skill with which linda drove. </s>
<s>  he knew no other girl who was master of the secrets of the desert and the canyons and the mountains. </s>
<s>  certainly he knew no other girl who would tug at great boulders and build a fireplace and risk burning her fingers and scorching her face to prepare a meal for him. </s>
<s>  so he watched linda and so he thought. </s>
<s>  at first he thought she was the finest pal a boy ever had, and then he thought how he meant to work to earn and keep her friendship. </s>
<s>  and then, as the fire reddened linda's cheeks and she made running comments while she deftly turned her skewers of brigand beefsteak, food that half the boy scouts in the country had been eating for four years, there came an idea with which he dallied until it grew into a luring vision. </s>
<s>  "linda," he asked suddenly, "do you know that one of these days you're going to be a beautiful woman?" linda turned her skewers with intense absorption. </s>
<s>  at first he almost thought she had not heard him, but at last she said quietly: "do you really think that is possible, donald?" "you're lovely right now !" answered the boy promptly. </s>
<s>  "for goodness' sake, have an eye single to your record for truth and veracity," said linda. </s>
<s>  "doesn't this begin to smell zippy?" "it certainly does," said donald. </s>
<s>  "it's making me ravenous. </s>
<s>  but honest, linda, you are a pretty girl. </s>
<s> " "honest, your foot!" said linda scornfully. </s>
<s>  "i am not a pretty girl. </s>
<s>  i am lean and bony and i have got a beak where i should have a nose. </s>
<s>  speaking of pretty girls, my sister, eileen, is a pretty girl. </s>
<s>  she is a downright beautiful girl. </s>
<s> " "yes," said donald, "she is, but she can't hold a candle to you. </s>
<s>  how did she look when she was your age?" "i can't remember eileen," said linda, "when she was not exquisitely dressed and thinking more about taking care of her shoes than anything else in the world. </s>
<s>  i can't remember her when she was not curled, and even when she was a tiny thing mother put a dust of powder on her nose. </s>
<s>  she said her skin was so delicate that it could not bear the sun. </s>
<s>  she never could run or play or motor much or do anything, because she has always had to be saved for the sole purpose of being exquisitely beautiful. </s>
<s>  talk about lilies of the field, that's what eileen is! she is an improvement on the original lily of the field--she is a lily of the drawing room. </s>
<s>  me, now, i am more of a joshua tree. </s>
<s> " donald whiting laughed, as linda intended that he should. </s>
<s>  a minute afterward she slid the savory food from a skewer upon one of the pie pans, tossed back the cover from the little table, stacked some bread-and-butter sandwiches beside the meat and handed the pan to donald. </s>
<s>  "fall to," she said, "and prove that you're a man with an appreciative tummy. </s>
<s>  father used to be positively ravenous for this stuff. </s>
<s>  i like it myself. </s>
<s> " she slid the food from the second skewer to a pan for herself, settled the fire to her satisfaction and they began their meal. </s>
<s>  presently she filled a cup from the bucket beside her and handed it to donald. </s>
<s>  at the same time she lifted another for herself. </s>
<s>  "here's to the barrel cactus," she said. </s>
<s>  "may the desert grow enough of them so that we'll never lack one when we want to have a saturday picnic. </s>
<s> " laughingly they drank this toast. </s>
<s>  and the skewers were filled a second time. </s>
<s>  when they could eat no more they packed away the lunch things, buried the fire, took the axe and the field glasses, and started on a trip of exploration down the canyon. </s>
<s>  together they admired delicate and exquisite ferns growing around great gray boulders. </s>
<s>  donald tasted hunters' rock leek, and learned that any he found while on a hunting expedition would furnish a splendid substitute for water. </s>
<s>  linda told him of rare flowers she lacked and what they were like and how he would be able to identify what she wanted in case he should ever find any when he was out hunting or with his other friends. </s>
<s>  they peeped into the nesting places of canyon wrens and doves and finches, and listened to the exquisite courting songs of the birds whose hearts were almost bursting with the exuberance of spring and the joy of home making. </s>
<s>  when they were tired out they went back to the dining room and after resting a time, they made a supper from the remnants of their dinner. </s>
<s>  when they were seated in the car and linda's hand was on the steering wheel, donald reached across and covered it with his own. </s>
<s>  "wait a bit," he said. </s>
<s>  "before we leave here i want to ask you a question and i want you to make me a promise. </s>
<s> " "all right," said linda. </s>
<s>  "what's your question?" "what is there," said donald, "that i can do that would give you such pleasure as you have given me?" linda could jest on occasions, but by nature she was a serious person. </s>
<s>  she looked at donald reflectively. </s>
<s>  "why, i think," she said at last, "that having a friend, having someone who understands and who cares for the things i do, and who likes to go to the same places and to do the same things, is the biggest thing that has happened to me since i lost my father. </s>
<s>  i don't see that you are in any way in my debt, donald. </s>
<s> " "all right then," said the boy, "that brings me to the promise i want you to make me. </s>
<s>  may we always have our saturdays together like this?" "sure!" said linda, "i would be mightily pleased. </s>
<s>  i'll have to work later at night and scheme, maybe. </s>
<s>  by good rights saturday belongs to me anyway because i am born saturday's child. </s>
<s> " "well, hurrah for saturday! it always was a grand old day," said donald, "and since i see what it can do in turning out a girl like you, i have got a better opinion of it than ever. </s>
<s>  we'll call that settled. </s>
<s>  i'll always ask you on friday at what hour to come, and hereafter saturday is ours. </s>
<s> " "ours it is," said linda. </s>
<s>  then she put the bear cat through the creek and on the road  driving swiftly as she dared, ran to lilac valley and up to peter morrison's location. </s>
<s>  she was amazed at the amount of work that had been accomplished. </s>
<s>  the garage was finished. </s>
<s>  peter's temporary work desk and his cot were in it. </s>
<s>  a number of his personal belongings were there. </s>
<s>  the site for his house had been selected and the cellar was being excavated. </s>
<s>  linda descended from the bear cat and led donald before peter. </s>
<s>  "since you're both my friends," she said, "i want you to know each other. </s>
<s>  this is donald whiting, the senior i told you about, mr. </s>
<s>  morrison. </s>
<s>  you know you said you would help him if you could. </s>
<s> " "certainly," said peter. </s>
<s>  "i am very glad to know any friend of yours, miss linda. </s>
<s>  come over to my workroom and let's hear about this. </s>

<s>  "i am going up here to have a private conversation with the spring. </s>

<s> " "fine!" said peter. </s>
<s>  "take your time and become extremely confidential, because the more i look at the location and the more i hear the gay chuckling song that that water sings, the more i am in love with your plan to run it across the lawn and bring it around the boulder. </s>

<s>  linda's hearthstone early the following week linda came from school one evening to find a load of sand and a heap of curiously marked stones beside the back door. </s>
<s>  "can it possibly be, katy," she asked, "that those men are planning to begin work on my room so soon? i am scared out of almost seven of my five senses. </s>
<s>  i had no idea they would be ready to begin work until after i had my settlement with eileen or was paid for the books. </s>
<s> " "don't ye be worried," said katy. </s>
<s>  "there's more in me stocking than me leg, and you're as welcome to it as the desert is welcome to rain, an' nadin' it 'most as bad. </s>
<s> " "anyway," said linda, "it will surely take them long enough so that i can pay by the time they finish. </s>
<s> " but linda was not figuring that back of the projected improvements stood two men, each of whom had an extremely personal reason for greatly desiring to please her. </s>
<s>  peter morrison had secured a slab of sandstone. </s>
<s>  he had located a marble cutter to whom he meant to carry it, and was spending much thought that he might have been using on an article in trying to hit upon exactly the right line or phrase to build in above linda's fire--something that would convey to her in a few words a sense of friendship and beauty. </s>
<s>  while peter gazed at the unresponsive gray sandstone and wrote line after line which he immediately destroyed, henry anderson explored the mountain and came in, red faced and perspiring, from miles of climbing with a bright stone in each h or took the car to bring in small heaps too heavy to carry that he had collected near the roads. </s>
<s>  they were two men striving for the favor of the same girl. </s>
<s>  how linda would have been amused had she understood the situation, or how eileen would have been provoked, neither of the men knew nor did they care. </s>
<s>  the workmen came after linda left and went before her return. </s>
<s>  having been cautioned to silence, katy had not told her when work actually began. </s>
<s>  and so it happened that, going to her room one evening, she unlocked the door and stepped inside to face the completed fireplace. </s>
<s>  the firebox was not very large but ample. </s>
<s>  the hearthstone was a big sheet of smooth gray sandstone. </s>
<s>  the sides and top were henry's collection of brilliant boulders, carefully and artistically laid in blue mortar, and over the firebox was set peter's slab of gray sandstone. </s>
<s>  on it were four deeply carved lines. </s>
<s>  the quaint old english lettering was filled even to the surface with a red mortar, while the capitals were done in dull blue. </s>
<s>  the girl slowly read:  voiceless stones, with flame-tongues preach   sermons struck from nature's lyre. </s>
<s>   notes of love and trust and hope   hourly sing in linda's fire. </s>
<s>  in the firebox stood a squat pair of black andirons, showing age and usage. </s>
<s>  a rough eucalyptus log waited across them while the shavings from the placing of the mantel and the cutting of the windows were tucked beneath it. </s>
<s>  linda stood absorbed a minute. </s>
<s>  she looked at the skylight, flooding the room with the light she so needed coming from the right angle. </s>
<s>  she went over to the new window that gave her a view of the length of the valley she loved and a most essential draft. </s>
<s>  when she turned back to the fireplace her hands were trembling. </s>
<s>  "now isn't that too lovely of them?" she said softly. </s>
<s>  "isn't that altogether wonderful? how i wish daddy were here to sit beside my fire and share with me the work i hope to do here. </s>
<s> " in order to come as close to him as possible she did the next best thing. </s>
<s>  she sat down at her table and wrote a long letter to marian, telling her everything she could think of that would interest her. </s>
<s>  then she re-read with extreme care the letter she had found at the post office that day in reply to the one she had written marian purporting to come from an admirer. </s>
<s>  writing slowly and thinking deeply, she answered it. </s>
<s>  she tried to imagine that she was peter morrison and she tried to say the things in that letter that she thought peter would say in the circumstances, because she felt sure that marian would be entertained by such things as peter would say. </s>
<s>  when she finished, she read it over carefully, and then copied it with equal care on the typewriter, which she had removed to her workroom. </s>
<s>  when she heard katy's footstep outside her door, she opened it and drew her in, slipping the bolt behind her. </s>
<s>  she led her to the fireplace and recited the lines. </s>
<s>  "now ain't they jist the finest gentlemen?" said katy. </s>
<s>  "cut right off of a piece of the same cloth as your father. </s>
<s>  now some way we must get together enough money to get ye a good-sized rug for under your worktable, and then ye've got to have two bits of small ones, one for your hearthstone and one for your aisel. </s>
<s>  and then ye're ready, colleen, to show what ye can do. </s>
<s>  i am so proud of ye when i think of the grand secret it's keepin' for ye i am. </s>
<s>  and less and less are gettin' me chances for the salvation of me soul, for every night i am a-sittin' starin' at the magazines ye gave me when i ought to be tellin' me beads and makin' me devotions. </s>
<s>  ain't it about time the third was comin' in?" "any day now," said linda in a whisper. </s>
<s>  " katy, you'll be careful? that editor must think that 'jane meredith' is full of years and ripe experience. </s>
<s>  i probably wouldn't get ten cents, no not even a for-nothing chance, if he knew those articles were written by a junior. </s>
<s> " "junior nothing!" scoffed katy. </s>
<s>  "there was not a day of his life that your pa did not spend hours drillin' ye in things the rest of the girls in your school never heard of. </s>
<s>  'tain't no high-school girl that's written them articles. </s>
<s>  it's alexander strong speakin' through the medium of his own flesh and blood. </s>
<s> " "why, so it is, katy!" cried linda delightedly. </s>
<s>  "you know, i never thought of that. </s>
<s>  i have been so egoistical i thought i was doing them myself. </s>
<s> " "paid ye anything yet?" queried katy. </s>
<s>  "no," said linda, "they haven't. </s>
<s>  it seems that the amount of interest the articles evoke is going to decide what i am to be paid for them, but they certainly couldn't take the recipe and the comments and the sketch for less than twenty-five or thirty dollars, unless recipes are like poetry. </s>
<s>  peter said the other day that if a poet did not have some other profession to support him, he would starve to death on all he was paid for writing the most beautiful things that ever are written in all this world. </s>
<s>  peter says even an effort to write a poem is a beautiful thing. </s>
<s> " "well, maybe that used to be the truth," said katy as she started toward the door, "but i have been reading some things labeled 'poetry' in the magazines of late, and if the holy father knows what they mean, he is even bigger than ever i took him to be. </s>
<s> " "katy," said linda, "we are dreadful back numbers. </s>
<s>  we are letting this world progress and roll right on past us without a struggle. </s>
<s>  we haven't either one been to a psychoanalyst to find out the color of our auras. </s>
<s> " "now god forbid," said katy. </s>
<s>  "i ain't going to have one of them things around me. </s>
<s>  the colors i am wearin' satisfy me entoirely. </s>
<s> " "and mine are going to satisfy me very shortly, now," laughed linda, "because tomorrow is my big day with eileen. </s>
<s>  next time we have a minute together, old dear, i'll have started my bank account. </s>
<s> " "right ye are," said katy, "jist exactly right. </s>
<s>  you're getting such a great girl it's the proper thing ye should be suitably dressed, and don't ye be too modest. </s>
<s> " "the unfortunate thing about that, katy, is that l intimated the other day that i would be content with less than half, since she is older and she should have her chance first. </s>
<s> " "now ain't that jist like ye?" said katy. </s>
<s>  "i might have known ye would be doing that very thing. </s>
<s> " "after i have gone over the accounts," said linda, "i'll know better what to demand. </s>
<s>  now fly to your cooking, katy, and let me sit down at this table and see if i can dig out a few dollars of honest coin. </s>
<s>  but i am going to have hard work to keep my eves on the paper with that fireplace before me. </s>
<s>  isn't that red and blue lettering the prettiest thing, katy, and do you notice that tiny 'p. </s>
<s>  m. </s>
<s> ' cut down in the lower left-hand corner nearly out of sight? that, katy, stands for 'peter morrison,' and one of these days peter is going to be a large figure on the landscape. </s>
<s>  the next post he has an article in i'll buy for you. </s>
<s> " "it never does," said katy, "to be makin' up your mind in this world so hard and fast that ye can't change it. </s>
<s>  in the days before john gilman got bewitched out of his senses i did think, barrin' your father, that he was the finest man the lord ever made. </s>
<s>  but i ain't thought so much of him of late as i did before. </s>
<s> " "same holds good for me," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i have studied this peter," continued katy, "like your pa used to study things under his microscope. </s>
<s>  he is the most come-at-able man. </s>
<s>  he is got such a kind of a questionin' look on his face, and there's a bit of a stoop to his shoulders like they had been whittled out for carryin' a load, and there's a kind of a whimsy quiverin' around his lips that makes me heart stand still every time he speaks to me, because i can't be certain whether he is going to make me laugh or going to make me cry, and when what he is sayin' does come with that little slow drawl, i can't be just sure whether he is meanin' it or whether he is jist pokin' fun at me. </s>
<s>  he said the quarest thing to me the other day when he was here fiddlin' over the makin' of this fireplace. </s>
<s>  he was standin' out beside your desert garden and i come aven with him and i says to him: 'them's the rare plants miss linda and her pa have been goin' to the deserts and the canyons, as long as he lived, to fetch in. </s>
<s>  and then miss linda went alone, and now the son of judge whiting, the biggest lawyer in los angeles, has begun goin' with her. </s>
<s>  ain't it the brightest, prettiest place?' i says to him. </s>
<s>  and he stood there lookin', and he says to me: 'no, katy, that is a graveyard. </s>
<s> ' now what in the name of raison was the man meanin' by that?" linda stared at the hearth motto reflectively. </s>
<s>  "a graveyard!" she repeated. </s>
<s>  "well, if anything could come farther from a graveyard than that spot, i don't know how it would do it. </s>
<s>  i haven't the remotest notion what he meant. </s>
<s>  why didn't you ask him?" "well, the truth is," said katy, "that i proide myself on being able to kape me mouth shut when i should. </s>
<s> " "i'll leave to think over it," said linda. </s>
<s>  "at present i have no more idea than you in what respect my desert garden could resemble a graveyard. </s>
<s>  oh! yes, there's one thing i wanted to ask you, katy. </s>
<s>  has eileen been around while this room was being altered?" "she came in yesterday," answered katy, "when the hammerin' and sawin' was goin' full blast. </s>
<s> " "what i wanted to find out'" said linda, "was whether she had been here and seen this room or not, because if she hasn't and she wants to see it, now is her time. </s>
<s>  after i get things going here and these walls are covered with drying sketches this room is going to be strictly private. </s>
<s>  you see that you keep your key where nobody gets hold of it. </s>
<s> " "it's on a string round me neck this blessed minute," said katy. </s>
<s>  "i didn't see her come up here, but ye could be safe in bettin' anything ye've got that she came. </s>
<s> " "yes, i imagine she did," said linda. </s>
<s>  "she would be sufficiently curious that she would come to learn how much i have spent if she had no other interest in me. </s>
<s> " she looked at the fireplace reflectively. </s>
<s>  "i wonder," she said, "what eileen thought of that and i wonder if she noticed that little 'p. </s>
<s>  m. </s>
<s> ' tucked away down there in the corner. </s>
<s> " "sure she did," said katy. </s>
<s>  "she has got eyes like a cat. </s>
<s>  she can see more things in a shorter time than anybody i ever knew. </s>
<s> " so that evening at dinner linda told eileen that the improvements she had made for her convenience in the billiard room were finished, and asked her if she would like to see them. </s>
<s>  "i can't imagine what you want to stick yourself off up there alone for," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "i don't believe i am sufficiently interested in garret skylights and windows to climb up to look at them. </s>
<s>  what everybody in the neighborhood can see is that you have absolutely ruined the looks of the back part of the house. </s>
<s> " "good gracious!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "have i? you know i never thought of that. </s>
<s> " "of course! but all you've got to do is go on the cast lawn and take a look at that side and the back end of the house to see what you have done," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "undoubtedly you've cut the selling price of the house one thous at least. </s>
<s>  but it's exactly like you not to have thought of what chopping up the roof and the end of the house as you have done, would make it look like. </s>
<s>  you have got one of those single-track minds, linda, that can think of only one thing at a time, and you never do think, when you start anything, of what the end is going to be. </s>
<s> " "very likely there's a large amount of truth in that," said linda soberly. </s>
<s>  "perhaps i do get an idea and pursue it to the exclusion of everything else. </s>
<s>  it's an inheritance from daddy, this concentrating with all my might on one thing at a time. </s>
<s>  but i am very sorry if i have disfigured the house. </s>
<s> " "what i want to know," said eileen, "is how in this world, at present wages and cost of material, you're expecting to pay men for the work you have had done. </s>
<s> "  "i can talk more understandingly about that," said linda quietly, "day after tomorrow. </s>
<s>  i'll get home from school tomorrow as early as i can, and then we'll figure out our financial situation exactly. </s>
<s> " eileen made no reply. </s>
<s>  chapter xvi. </s>
<s>  producing the evidence when linda hurried home the next evening, her first word to katy was to ask if eileen were there. </s>
<s>  "no, she isn't here," said katy, "and she is not going to be. </s>
<s> " "not going to be!" cried linda, her face paling perceptibly. </s>
<s>  "she went downtown this morning and she telephoned me about three sayin' she had an invoitation to go with a motor party to pasadena this afternoon, an' she wasn't knowin' whether she could get home the night or not. </s>
<s> " "i don't like it," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i don't like it at all. </s>
<s> " she liked it still less when eileen came home for a change of clothing the following day, and again went to spend the night with a friend, without leaving any word whatever. </s>
<s>  "i don't understand this," said linda, white lipped and tense. </s>
<s>  "she does not want to see me. </s>
<s>  she does not intend to talk business with me if she can possibly help it. </s>
<s>  she is treating me as if i were a four-year-old instead of a woman with as much brain as she has. </s>
<s>  if she appears while i am gone tomorrow and starts away again, you tell her come to think of it, you needn't tell her anything. </s>
<s>  i'll give you a note for her. </s>
<s> " so linda sat down and wrote: dear eileen: it won't be necessary to remind you of our agreement night before last to settle on an allowance from father's estate for me. </s>
<s>  of course i realize that you are purposely avoiding seeing me, for what reason i can't imagine. </s>
<s>  but i give you warning, that if you have been in this house and have read this note, and are not here with your figures ready to meet me when i get home tomorrow night, i'll take matters into my own hands, and do exactly what i think best without the slightest reference to what you think about it. </s>
<s>  if you don't want something done that you will dislike, even more than you dislike seeing me, you had better heed this warning. </s>
<s>  linda. </s>
<s>  she read it over slowly: "my, that sounds melodramatic!" she commented. </s>
<s>  "it's even got a threat in it, and it's a funny thing to threaten my own sister. </s>
<s>  i don't think that it's a situation that occurs very frequently, but for that matter i sincerely hope that eileen isn't the kind of sister that occurs frequently. </s>
<s> " linda went up to her room and tried to settle herself to work, but found that it was impossible to fix her attention on what she was doing. </s>
<s>  her mind jumped from one thing to another in a way that totally prohibited effective work of any kind. </s>
<s>  a sudden resolve came into her heart. </s>
<s>  she would not wait any longer. </s>
<s>  she would know for herself just how she was situated financially. </s>
<s>  she wrote a note to the editor of everybody's home, asking him if it would be convenient to let her know what reception her work was having with his subscribers, whether he desired her to continue the department in his magazines, and if so, what was the best offer he could make her for the recipes, the natural history comments accompanying them, and the sketches. </s>
<s>  then she went down to the telephone book and looked up the location of the consolidated bank. </s>
<s>  she decided that she would stop there on her way from school the next day and ask to be shown the strong accounts. </s>
<s>  while she was meditating these heroic measures the bell rang and katy admitted john gilman. </s>
<s>  strangely enough, he was asking for linda, not for eileen. </s>
<s>  at the first glimpse of him linda knew that something was wrong. </s>
<s>  so without any prelude she said abruptly: "what's the matter, john? don't you know where i eileen is either?" "approximately," he answered. </s>
<s>  "she has 'phoned me two or three times, but i haven't seen her for three days. </s>
<s>  do you know where she is or exactly why she is keeping away from home as she is?" "yes," said linda, "i do. </s>
<s>  i told you the other day the time had come when i was going to demand a settlement of father's estate and a fixed income. </s>
<s>  that time came three days ago and i have not seen eileen since. </s>
<s> " they entered the living room. </s>
<s>  as linda passed the table, propped against a candlestick on it, she noticed a note addressed to herself. </s>
<s>  "oh, here will be an explanation," she said. </s>
<s>  "here is a note for me. </s>
<s>  sit down a minute till i read it. </s>
<s> " she seated herself on the arm of a chair, tore open the note, and instantly began reading aloud. </s>
<s>  "dear little sister--" "pathetic," interpolated linda, "in consideration of the fact that i am about twice as big as she is. </s>
<s>  however, we'll let that go, and focus on the enclosure. </s>
<s> " she waved a slender slip of paper at gilman. </s>
<s>  "i never was possessed of an article like this before in all my tender young life, but it seems to me that it's a cheque, and i can't tell you quite how deeply it amuses me. </s>
<s>  but to return to business, at the present instant i am: dear little sister: it seems that all the friends i have are particularly insistent on seeing me all at once and all in a rush. </s>
<s>  i don't think i ever had quite so many invitations at one time in my life before, and the next two or three days seem to be going to be equally as full. </s>
<s>  but i took time to run into the bank and go over things carefully. </s>
<s>  i find that after the payment of taxes and insurance and all the household expenses, that by wearing old clothes i have and making them over i can afford to turn over at least seventy-five dollars a month to you for your clothing and personal expenses. </s>
<s>  as i don't know exactly when i can get home, i am enclosing a cheque which is considerably larger than i had supposed i could make it, and i can only do this by skimping myself. </s>
<s>  but of course you are getting such a big girl and beginning to attract attention, so it is only right that you should have the very best that i can afford to do for you. </s>
<s>  i am not taking the bill from the mode into consideration. </s>
<s>  i paid that with last month's expenses. </s>
<s>  with love, eileen. </s>
<s>  linda held the letter in one h the cheque in the other, and stared questioningly at john gilman. </s>
<s>  "what do you think of that?" she inquired tersely. </s>
<s>  "it seems to me," said gilman, "that a more pertinent question would be, what do you think of it?" "rot!" said linda tersely. </s>
<s>  "if i were a stenographer in your office i would think that i was making a fairly good start. </s>
<s>  but i happen to be the daughter of alexander strong living in my own home with my only sister, who can afford to flit like the flittingest of social butterflies from one party to another as well dressed as, and better dressed than, the great general average. </s>
<s>  you have known us, john, ever since eileen sat in the sun to dry her handmade curls, while i was leaving a piece of my dress on every busk in multiflores canyon. </s>
<s>  right here and now i am going to show you something!" linda started upstairs, so john gilman followed her. </s>
<s>  she went to the door of eileen's suite and opened it. </s>
<s>  "now then," she said, "take a look at what eileen feels she can afford for herself. </s>
<s>  you will observe she has complete and exquisite furnishings and all sorts of feminine accessories on her dressing table. </s>
<s>  you will observe that she has fine rugs in her dressing room and bathroom. </s>
<s>  let me call your attention to the fact that all these drawers are filled with expensive comforts and conveniences. </s>
<s> " angrily linda began to open drawers filled with fancy feminine apparel, daintily and neatly folded, everything in perfect order: gloves, hose, handkerchiefs, ribbons, laces, all in separate compartments she pointed to the high chiffonier, the top decorated with candlesticks and silver-framed pictures. </s>
<s>  here the drawers revealed heaps of embroidered underclothing and silken garments. </s>
<s>  then she walked to the closet and threw the door wide. </s>
<s>  she pushed hangers on their rods, sliding before the perplexed and bewildered man dress after dress of lace and georgette, walking suits of cloth, street dresses of silk, and pretty afternoon gowns, heavy coats, light coats, a beautiful evening coat. </s>
<s>  linda took this down and held it in front of john gilman. </s>
<s>  "i see things marked in store windows," she said. </s>
<s>  "eileen paid not a penny less than three hundred for this one coat. </s>
<s>  look at the rows of shoes, and pumps, and slippers, and what that box is or i don't know. </s>
<s> " linda slid to the light a box screened by the hanging dresses, and with the toe of her shoe lifted the lid, disclosing a complete smoking outfit--case after case of cigarettes. </s>
<s>  linda dropped the lid and shoved the box back. </s>
<s>  she stood silent a second, then she looked at john gilman. </s>
<s>  "that is the way things go in this world," she said quietly. </s>
<s>  "whenever you lose your temper, you always do something you didn't intend to do when you started. </s>
<s>  i didn't know that, and i wouldn't have shown it to you purposely if i had known it. </s>
<s>  but it doesn't alter the fact that you should know it. </s>
<s>  if you did know it no harm's done but if you didn't know it, you shouldn't be allowed to marry eileen without knowing as much about her as you did about marian, and there was nothing about marian that you didn't know. </s>
<s>  i am sorry for that, but since i have started this i am going through with it. </s>
<s>  now give me just one minute more. </s>
<s> " then she went down the hall, threw open the door to her room, and walking in said: "you have seen eileen's surroundings. </s>
<s>  now take a look at mine. </s>
<s>  there's my bed. </s>
<s>  there's my dresser and toilet articles. </s>
<s>  and this is my wardrobe. </s>
<s> " she opened the closet door and exhibited a pair of overalls in which she watered her desert garden. </s>
<s>  next ranged her khaki breeches and felt hat. </s>
<s>  then hung the old serge school dress, beside it the extra skirt and orange blouse. </s>
<s>  the stack of underclothing on the shelves was pitifully small, visibly dilapidated. </s>
<s>  two or three outgrown gingham dresses hung forlornly on the opposite wall. </s>
<s>  linda stood tall and straight before john gilman. </s>
<s>  "what i have on and one other waist constitute my wardrobe," she said, "and i told eileen where to get this dress and suggested it before i got it. </s>
<s> " gilman looked at her in a dazed fashion. </s>
<s>  "i don't underst" he said slowly. </s>
<s>  "if that isn't the dress i saw eileen send up for herself, i am badly mistaken. </s>
<s>  it was the saturday we went to riverside. </s>
<s>  it surely is the very dress. </s>
<s> " linda laughed bleakly. </s>
<s>  "that may be," she said. </s>
<s>  "the one time she ever has any respect for me is in a question of taste. </s>
<s>  she will agree that i know when colors are right and a thing is artistic. </s>
<s>  now then, john, you are the administrator of my father's estate. </s>
<s>  you have seen what you have seen. </s>
<s>  what are you going to do about it?" "linda," he said quietly, "what my heart might prompt me to do in consideration of the fact that i am engaged to marry eileen, and what my legal sense tells me i must do as executor of your father's wishes, are different propositions. </s>
<s>  i am going to do exactly what you tell me to. </s>
<s>  what you have shown me, and what i would have realized, if i had stopped to think, is neither right nor just. </s>
<s> " then linda took her tun at deep thought. </s>
<s>  "john," she said at last, "i am feeling depressed over what i have just done. </s>
<s>  i am not sure that in losing my temper and bringing you up here i have played the game fairly. </s>
<s>  you don't need to do anything. </s>
<s>  i'll manage my affairs with eileen myself. </s>
<s>  but i'll tell you before you go, that you needn't practice any subterfuges. </s>
<s>  when she reaches the point where she is ready to come home, i'll tell her that you were here, and what you have seen. </s>
<s>  that is the best i can do toward squaring myself with my own conscience. </s>
<s> " slowly they walked down the ha]l together. </s>
<s>  at the head of the stairs linda took the cheque that she carried and tore it into bits. </s>
<s>  stepping across the hall, she let the little heap slowly flutter to the rug in front of eileen's door. </s>
<s>  then she went back to her room and left john gilman to his own reflections. </s>
<s>   chapter xvii. </s>
<s>  a rock and a flame the first time linda entered the kitchen after her interview with gilman, katy asked in deep concern, "now what ye been doing, lambie?" "doing the baby act, katy," confessed linda. </s>
<s>  "disgracing myself. </s>
<s>  losing my temper. </s>
<s>  i wish i could bring myself to the place where i would think half a dozen times before i do a thing once. </s>
<s> " "now look here," said katy, beginning to bristle, "ain't it the truth that ye have thought for four years before ye did this thing once?" "quite so," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but since i am the daughter of the finest gentleman i ever knew, i should not do hasty, regrettable things. </s>
<s>  on the living-room table i found a note sweeter than honey, and it contained a cheque for me that wouldn't pay eileen's bills for lunches, candy, and theaters for a month. </s>
<s>  so in undue heat i reduced it to bits and decorated the rug before her door. </s>
<s>  but before that, katy, i led my guardian into the room, and showed him everything. </s>
<s>  i meant to tell him that, since he had neglected me for four years, he could see that i had justice now, but when i would personally conducted him from eileen's room to mine, and when i took a good look at him there was something on his face, katy, that i couldn't endure. </s>
<s>  so i told him to leave it to me. </s>
<s>  that i would tell eileen myself what i had done, and so i will. </s>
<s>  but i am sorry i did it, katy. </s>
<s>  i am awfully sorry. </s>
<s>  you always told me to keep my temper and i lost it completely. </s>
<s>  from now on i certainly will try to behave myself more like a woman than a spoiled child. </s>
<s>  now give me a dust cloth and brushes. </s>
<s>  i am almost through with my job in the library and i want to finish, because i shall be forced to use the money from the books to pay for my skylight and fireplace. </s>
<s> " linda went to the library and began work, efficiently, carefully, yet with a precise rapidity habitual to her. </s>
<s>  down the long line of heavy technical books, she came to the end of the shelf. </s>
<s>  three books from the end she noticed a difference in the wall behind the shelf. </s>
<s>  hastily removing the other two volumes, she disclosed a small locked door having a scrap of paper protruding from the edge which she pulled out and upon which she read: in the event of my passing, should anyone move these books and find this door, these lines are to inform him that it is to remain untouched. </s>
<s>  the key to it is in my safety-deposit vault at the consolidated bank. </s>
<s>  the bank will open the door and attend to the contents of the box at the proper time. </s>
<s>  linda fixed the paper back exactly as she had found it. </s>
<s>  she stood looking at the door a long time, then she carefully wiped it, the wall around it, and the shelf. </s>
<s>  going to another shelf, she picked out the books that had been written by her father  beginning at the end of the shelf, she ranged them in a row until they completely covered the opening. </s>
<s>  then she finished filling the shelf with other books that she meant to keep, but her brain was working, milling over and over the question of what that little compartment contained and when it was to be opened and whether john gilman knew about it, and whether the consolidated bank would remember the day specified, and whether it would mean anything important to her. </s>
<s>  she carried the dusters back to katy, and going to her room, concentrated resolutely upon her work. </s>
<s>  but she was unable to do anything constructive. </s>
<s>  her routine lessons she could prepare, but she could not even sketch a wild rose accurately. </s>
<s>  finally she laid down her pencil, washed her brushes, put away her material, and locking her door, slipped the key into her pocket. </s>
<s>  going down to the garage she climbed into the bear cat and headed straight for peter morrison. </s>
<s>  she drove into his location and blew the horn. </s>
<s>  peter stepped from the garage, and seeing her, started in her direction. </s>
<s>  linda sprang down and hurried toward him. </s>
<s>  he looked at her intently as she approached and formed his own conclusions. </s>
<s>  "sort of restless," said linda. </s>
<s>  "couldn't evolve a single new idea with which to enliven the gay annals of english literature and greek history. </s>
<s>  a personal history seems infinitely more insistent and unusual. </s>
<s>  i ran away from my lessons, and my work, and came to you, peter, because i had a feeling that there was something you could give me, and i thought you would. </s>
<s> " peter smiled a slow curious smile. </s>
<s>  "i like your line of thought, linda," he said quietly. </s>
<s>  "it greatly appeals to me. </s>
<s>  any time an ancient and patriarchal literary man named peter morrison can serve as a rock upon which a young thing can rest, why he'll be glad to be that rock. </s>
<s> " "what were you doing?" asked linda abruptly. </s>
<s>  "come and see," said peter. </s>
<s>  he led the way to the garage. </s>
<s>  his worktable and the cement floor around it were littered with sheets of closely typed paper. </s>
<s>  "i'll have to assemble them first," said peter, getting down on his knees and beginning to pick them up. </s>
<s>  linda sat on a packing case and watched him. </s>
<s>  already she felt comforted. </s>
<s>  of course peter was a rock, of course anyone could trust him, and of course if the tempest of life beat upon her too strongly she could always fly to peter. </s>
<s>  "may i?" she inquired, stretching her hand in the direction of a sheet. </s>
<s>  "sure," said peter. </s>
<s>  "what is it?" inquired linda lightly. </s>
<s>  "the bridge or the road or the playroom?" "gad!" he said slowly. </s>
<s>  "don't talk about me being a rock! rocks are stolid, stodgy unresponsive things. </s>
<s>  i thought i was struggling with one of the biggest political problems of the day from an economic and psychological standpoint. </s>
<s>  if i would had sense enough to realize that it was a bridge i was building, i might have done the thing with some imagination and subtlety. </s>
<s>  if you want a rock and you say i am a rock, a rock i'll be, linda. </s>
<s>  but i know what you are, and what you will be to me when we really become the kind of friends we are destined to be. </s>
<s> " "i wonder now," said linda, "if you are going to say that i could be any such lovely thing on the landscape as a bridge. </s>
<s> " "no," said peter slowly, "nothing so prosaic. </s>
<s>  bridges are common in this world. </s>
<s>  you are going to be something uncommon. </s>
<s>  history records the experiences of but one man who has seen a flame in the open. </s>
<s>  i am a second moses and you are going to be my burning bush. </s>
<s>  i intended to read this article to you. </s>
<s> " peter massed the sheets, straightened them on the desk, and deliberately ripped them across several times. </s>
<s>  linda sprang to her feet and stretched out her hands. </s>
<s>  "why, peter!" she cried in a shocked voice. </s>
<s>  "that is perfectly inexcusable. </s>
<s>  there are hours and hours of work on that, and i have not a doubt but that it was good work. </s>
<s> " "simple case of mechanism," said peter, reducing the bits to smaller size and dropping them into the empty nail keg that served as his wastebasket. </s>
<s>  "a lifeless thing without a soul, mere clockwork. </s>
<s>  i have got the idea now. </s>
<s>  i am to build a bridge and make a road. </s>
<s>  every way i look i can see a golden-flame tongue of inspiration burning. </s>
<s>  i'll rewrite that thing and animate it. </s>
<s>  take me for a ride, linda. </s>
<s> " linda rose and walked to the bear cat. </s>
<s>  peter climbed in and sat beside her. </s>
<s>  linda laid her hands on the steering wheel and started the car. </s>
<s>  she ran it down to the highway and chose a level road leading straight down the valley through cultivated country. </s>
<s>  in all the world there was nothing to equal the panorama that she spread before peter that evening. </s>
<s>  she drove the bear cat past orchards, hundreds of acres of orchards of waxen green leaves and waxen white bloom of orange, grapefruit, and lemon. </s>
<s>  she took him where seas of pink outlined peach orchards, and other seas the more delicate tint of the apricots. </s>
<s>  she glided down avenues lined with palm and eucalyptus, pepper and olive, and through unbroken rows, extending for miles, of roses, long stretches of white, again a stretch of pink, then salmon, yellow, and red. </s>
<s>  nowhere in all the world are there to be found so many acres of orchard bloom and so many miles of tree-lined, rose-decorated roadway as in southern california. </s>
<s>  she sent the little car through the evening until she felt that it was time to go home, and when at last she stopped where they had started, she realized that neither she nor peter had spoken one word. </s>
<s>  as he stepped from the car she leaned toward him and reached out her hand. </s>
<s>  "thank you for the fireplace, peter," she said. </s>
<s>  peter took the hand she extended and held it one minute in both his own. </s>
<s>  then very gently he straightened it out in the palm of one of his hands and with the other hand turned back the fingers and laid his lips to the heart of it. </s>
<s>  "thank you, linda, for the flame," he said, and turning abruptly, he went toward his workroom. </s>
<s>  stopping for a bite to eat in the kitchen, linda went back to her room. </s>
<s>  she sat down at the table and picking up her pencil, began to work, and found that she could work. </s>
<s>  every stroke came true and strong. </s>
<s>  every idea seemed original and unusual. </s>
<s>  quite as late as a light ever had shone in her window, it shone that night, the last thing she did being to write another anonymous letter to marian, and when she reread it linda realized that it was an appealing letter. </s>
<s>  she thought it certainly would comfort marian and surely would make her feel that someone worth while was interested in her and in her work. </s>
<s>  she loved some of the whimsical little touches she had put into it, and she wondered if she had made it so much like peter morrison that it would be suggestive of him to marian. </s>
<s>  she knew that she had no right to do that and had no such intention. </s>
<s>  she merely wanted a model to copy from and peter seemed the most appealing model at hand. </s>
<s>  after school the next day linda reported that she had finished going through the books and was ready to have them taken. </s>
<s>  then, after a few minutes of deep thought, she made her way to the consolidated bank. </s>
<s>  at the window of the paying teller she explained that she wished to see the person connected with the bank who had charge of the safety-deposit boxes and who looked after the accounts pertaining to the estate of alexander strong. </s>
<s>  the teller recognized the name. </s>
<s>  he immediately became deferential. </s>
<s>  "i'll take you to the office of the president," he said. </s>
<s>  "he and doctor strong were very warm friends. </s>
<s>  you can explain to him what it is you want to know. </s>
<s> " before she realized what was happening, linda found herself in an office that was all mahogany and marble. </s>
<s>  at a huge desk stacked with papers sat a man, considerably older than her father. </s>
<s>  linda remembered to have seen him frequently in their home, in her father's car, and she recalled one fishing expedition to the tulare lake region where he had been a member of her father's party. </s>
<s>  "of course you have forgotten me, mr. </s>
<s>  worthington," she said as she approached his desk. </s>
<s>  "i have grown such a tall person during the past four years. </s>
<s> " the white-haired financier rose and stretched out his hand. </s>
<s>  "you exact replica of alexander strong," he said laughingly, "i couldn't forget you any more than i could forget your father. </s>
<s>  that fine fishing trip where you proved such a grand little scout is bright in my memory as one of my happiest vacations. </s>
<s>  sit down and tell me what i can do for you. </s>
<s> " linda sat down and told him that she was dissatisfied with the manner in which her father's estate was being administered. </s>
<s>  he listened very carefully to all she had to say, then he pressed a button and gave a few words of instruction to the clerk who answered it. </s>
<s>  when several ledgers and account books were laid before him, with practiced hand he turned to what he wanted. </s>
<s>  the records were not complicated. </s>
<s>  they covered a period of four years. </s>
<s>  they showed exactly what monies had been paid into the bank for the estate. </s>
<s>  they showed what royalties had been paid on the books. </s>
<s>  linda sat beside him and watched his pencil running up and down columns, setting down a list of items, and making everything plain. </s>
<s>  paid cheques for household expenses i and drygoods bills were all recorded and deducted. </s>
<s>  with narrow, alert eyes, linda was watching, and her brain was keenly alive. </s>
<s>  as she realized the discrepancy between the annual revenue from the estate and the totaling of the expenses, she had an inspiration. </s>
<s>  something she never before had thought of occurred to her. </s>
<s>  she looked the banker in the eye and said very quietly: "and now, since she is my sister and i am going to be of age very shortly and these things must all be gone into and opened up, would it be out of place for me to ask you this afternoon to let me have a glimpse at the private account of miss eileen strong?" the banker drew a deep breath and looked at linda keenly. </s>
<s>  "that would not be customary," he said slowly. </s>
<s>  "no?" said linda. </s>
<s>  "but since father and mother went out at the same time and there was no will and the property would be legally divided equally between us upon my coming of age, would my sister be entitled to a private account?" "had she any sources of obtaining money outside the estate?" "no," said linda. </s>
<s>  "at least none that i know of. </s>
<s>  mother had i some relatives in san francisco who were very wealthy people, but they never came to see us and we never went there. </s>
<s>  i know nothing about them. </s>
<s>  i never had any money from them and i am quite sure eileen never had. </s>
<s> " linda sat very quietly a minute and then she looked at the banker. </s>
<s>  "mr. </s>
<s>  worthington," she said, "the situation is slightly peculiar. </s>
<s>  my guardian, john gilman, is engaged to marry my sister eileen. </s>
<s>  she is a beautiful girl, as you no doubt recall, and he is very much in love with her. </s>
<s>  undoubtedly she has been able, at least recently, to manage affairs very much in her own way. </s>
<s>  she is more than four years my senior, and has always had charge of the household accounts and the handling of the bank accounts. </s>
<s>  since there is such a wide discrepancy between the returns from the property and the expenses that these books show, i am forced . </s>
<s> o the conclusion that there must be upon your books, or the books of some other bank in the city, a private account in eileen's name or in the name of the strong estate. </s>
<s> " "that i can very easily ascertain," said mr. </s>
<s>  worthington, reaching again toward the button on his desk. </s>
<s>  a few minutes later the report came that there was a private account in the name of miss eileen strong. </s>
<s>  again linda was deeply thoughtful. </s>
<s>  "is there anything i can do," she inquired, "to prevent that account from being changed or drawn out previous to my coming of age?" then mr. </s>
<s>  worthington grew thoughtful. </s>
<s>  "yes," he said at last. </s>
<s>  "if you are dissatisfied, if you feel that you have reason to believe that money rightfully belonging to you is being diverted to other channels, you have the right to issue an injunction against the bank, ordering it not to pay out any further money on any account nor to honor any cheques drawn by miss strong until the settlement of the estate. </s>
<s>  ask your guardian to execute and deliver such an injunction, or merely ask him, as your guardian and the administrator of the estate, to give the bank a written order to that effect. </s>
<s> " "but because he is engaged to eileen, i told him i would not bring him into this matter," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i told him that i would do what i wanted done, myself. </s>
<s> " "well, how long is it until this coming birthday of yours?" inquired mr. </s>
<s>  worthington. </s>
<s>  "less than two weeks," answered linda. </s>
<s>  for a time the financier sat in deep thought, then he looked at linda. </s>
<s>  it was a keen, searching look. </s>
<s>  it went to the depths of her eyes. </s>
<s>  it included her face and hair. </s>
<s>  it included the folds of her dress, the cut of her shoe, and rested attentively on the slender hands lying quietly in her lap. </s>
<s>   "i see the circumstances very clearly," he said. </s>
<s>  "i sympathize with your position. </s>
<s>  having known your father and being well acquainted with your guardian, would you be satisfied if i should take the responsibility of issuing to the clerks an order not to allow anything to be drawn from the private account until the settlement of the estate?" "perfectly satisfied," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it might be," said mr. </s>
<s>  worthington, "managing matters i that way, that no one outside of ourselves need ever know of il should your sister not draw on the private account in the mean time, she would be free to draw household cheques on the monthly income and if in the settlement of the estate she turns in this private account or accounts, she need never know of the restriction concerning this fund. </s>
<s> " "thank you very much," said linda. </s>
<s>  "that will fix everything finely. </s>
<s> " on her way to the street car, linda's brain whirled. </s>
<s>  "it's not conceivable," she said, "that eileen should be enriching herself at my expense. </s>
<s>  i can't imagine her being dishonest in money affairs, and yet i can recall scarcely a circumstance in life in which eileen has ever hesitated to be dishonest when a lie served her purpose better than the truth. </s>
<s>  anyway, matters are safe now. </s>
<s> " the next day the books were taken and a cheque for their value was waiting for linda when she reached home. </s>
<s>  she cashed this cheque and went straight to peter morrison for his estimate of the expenses for the skylight and fireplace. </s>
<s>  when she asked for the bill peter hesitated. </s>
<s>  "you wouldn't accept this little addition to your study as a gift from henry and me?" he asked lightly. </s>
<s>  "it would be a great pleasure to us if you would. </s>
<s> " "i could accept stones that henry anderson had gathered from the mountains and canyons, and i could accept a verse carved on stone, and be delighted with the gift. </s>
<s>  but i couldn't accept hours of day labor at the present price of labor, so you will have to give me the bill, peter. </s>
<s> " peter did not have the bill, but he had memoranda, and when linda paid him she reflected that the current talk concerning the inflated price of labor was greatly exaggerated. </s>
<s>  for two evenings as linda returned from school and went to her room she glanced down the hall and smiled at the decoration remaining on eileen's rug. </s>
<s>  the third evening it was gone, so that she knew eileen was either in her room or had been there. </s>
<s>  she did not meet her sister until dinnertime. </s>
<s>  she was prepared to watch eileen, to study her closely. </s>
<s>  she was not prepared to admire her, but in her heart she almost did that very thing. </s>
<s>  eileen had practiced subterfuges so long, she was so accomplished, that it would have taken an expert to distinguish reality from subterfuge. </s>
<s>  she entered the dining room humming a gay tune. </s>
<s>  she was carefully dressed and appealingly beautiful. </s>
<s>  she blew a kiss to linda and waved gaily to katy. </s>
<s>  "i was rather afraid," she said lightly, "that i might find you two in mourning when i got back. </s>
<s>  i never stayed so long before, did i? seemed as if every friend i had made special demand on my time all at once. </s>
<s>  hope you haven't been dull without me. </s>
<s> " "oh, no," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "being away at school all day, of course i wouldn't know whether you were at home or not, and i have grown so accustomed to spending my evenings alone that i don't rely on you for entertainment at any time. </s>
<s> " "in other words," said eileen, "it doesn't make any difference to you where i am. </s>
<s> " "not so far as enjoying your company is concerned," said linda. </s>
<s>  "otherwise, of course it makes a difference. </s>
<s>  i hope you had a happy time. </s>
<s> " "oh, i always have a happy time," answered eileen lightly. </s>
<s>  "i certainly have the best friends. </s>
<s> " "that's your good fortune," answered linda. </s>
<s>  at the close of the meal linda sat waiting. </s>
<s>  eileen gave katy instructions to have things ready for a midnight lunch for her and john gilman and then, humming her tune again, she left the dining room and went upstairs. </s>
<s>  linda stood looking after her. </s>
<s>   "now or never," she said at last. </s>
<s>  "i have no business to let her meet john until i have recovered my self-respect. </s>
<s>  but the lord help me to do the thing decently !" so she followed eileen up the stairway. </s>
<s>  she tapped at the door, and without waiting to hear whether she was invited or not, opened it and stepped inside. </s>
<s>  eileen was sitting before the window, a big box of candy beside her, a magazine in her fingers. </s>
<s>  evidently she intended to keep her temper in case the coming interview threatened to become painful. </s>
<s>  "i was half expecting you," she said, "you silly hothead. </s>
<s>  i found the cheque i wrote you when i got home this afternoon. </s>
<s>  that was a foolish thing to do. </s>
<s>  why did you tear it up? if it were too large or if it were not enough why didn't you use it and ask for another? because i had to be away that was merely to leave you something to go on until i got back. </s>
<s> " then linda did the most disconcerting thing possible. </s>
<s>  in her effort at self-control she went too far. </s>
<s>  she merely folded her hands in her lap and sat looking straight at eileen without saying one word. </s>
<s>  it did not show much on the surface, but eileen really had a conscience, she really had a soul. </s>
<s>  linda's eyes, resting rather speculatively on her, were honest eyes, and eileen knew what she knew. </s>
<s>  she flushed and fidgeted, and at last she broke out impatiently: "oh, for goodness' sake, linda, don't play 'patience-on-a-monument. </s>
<s> ' speak up and say what it is that you want. </s>
<s>  if that cheque was not big enough, what will satisfy you?" "come to think of it," said linda quietly, "i can get along with what i have for the short time until the legal settlement of our interests is due. </s>
<s>  you needn't bother any more about a cheque. </s>
<s> " eileen was surprised and her face showed it. </s>
<s>  and she was also relieved. </s>
<s>  that too her face showed. </s>
<s>  "i always knew," she said lightly, "that i had a little sister with a remarkably level head and good common sense. </s>
<s>  i am glad that you recognize the awful inflation of prices during the war period, and how i have had to skimp and scheme and save in order to make ends meet and to keep us going on papa's meager income. </s>
<s> " all linda's good resolutions vanished. </s>
<s>  she was under strong nervous tension. </s>
<s>  it irritated her to have eileen constantly referring to their monetary affairs as if they were practically paupers, as if their father's life had been a financial failure, as if he had not been able to realize from achievements recognized around the world a comfortable living for two women. </s>
<s>  "oh, good lord!" she said shortly. </s>
<s>  "bluff the rest of the world like a professional, eileen, but why try it with me? you're right about my having common sense. </s>
<s>  i'll admit that i am using it now. </s>
<s>  i will be of age in a few days, and then we'll take john gilman and go to the consolidated bank, and if it suits your convenience to be absent for four or five days at that period, i'll take john gilman and we'll go together. </s>
<s> " eileen was amazed. </s>
<s>  the receding color in her cheeks left the rouge on them a ghastly, garish thing. </s>
<s>  "well, i won't do anything of the sort," she said hotly, "and neither will john gilman. </s>
<s> " "unfortunately for you," answered linda, "john gilman is my guardian, not yours. </s>
<s>  he'll be forced to do what the law says he must, and what common decency tells him he must, no matter what his personal feelings are. </s>
<s>  and i might as well tell you that your absence has done you no good. </s>
<s>  you'd far better have come home, as you agreed to, and gone over the books and made me a decent allowance, because in your absence john came here to ask me where you were, and i know that he was anxious. </s>
<s> " "he came here!" cried eileen. </s>
<s>  "why, yes," said linda. </s>
<s>  "was it anything unusual? hasn't he been coming here ever since i can remember? evidently you didn't keep him as well posted this time as you usually do. </s>
<s>  he came here and asked for me. </s>
<s> " "and i suppose," said eileen, an ugly red beginning to rush into her white cheeks, "that you took pains to make things uncomfortable for me. </s>
<s> " "i am very much afraid," said linda, "that you are right. </s>
<s>  you have made things uncomfortable for me ever since i can remember, for i can't remember the time when you were not finding fault with me, putting me in the wrong and getting me criticized and punished if you possibly could. </s>
<s>  it was a fair understanding that you should be here, and you were not, and i was seeing red about it. </s>
<s>  and just as john came in i found your note in tile living room and read it aloud. </s>
<s> '. </s>
<s>  "oh, well, there was nothing in that," said eileen in a relieved tone. </s>
<s>   "nothing in the wording of it, no," said linda, "but there was everything in the intention back of it. </s>
<s>  because you did not live up to your tacit agreement, and because i had been on high tension for two or three days, i lost my temper completely. </s>
<s>  i brought john gilman up here and showed him the suite of rooms in which you have done for yourself, for four years. </s>
<s>  i gave him rather a thorough inventory of your dressing table and drawers, and then i opened the closet door and called his attention to the number and the quality of the garments hanging there. </s>
<s>  the box underneath them i thought was a shoe box, but it didn't prove to be exactly that. </s>
<s>  and for that i want to tell you, as i have already told john, i am sorry. </s>
<s>  i wouldn't have done that if i had known what i was doing. </s>
<s> " "is that all?" inquired eileen, making a desperate effort at self-control. </s>
<s>  "not quite," said linda. </s>
<s>  "when i finished with your room, i took him back and showed him mine in even greater detail than i showed him yours. </s>
<s>  i thought the contrast would be more enlightening than anything either one of us could say. </s>
<s> " "and i suppose you realize," said eileen bitterly, "that you lost me john gilman when you did it. </s>
<s> " "i?" said linda. </s>
<s>  "i lost you john gilman when i did it? but i didn't do it. </s>
<s>  you did it. </s>
<s>  you have been busy for four years doing it. </s>
<s>  if you hadn't done it, it wouldn't have been there for me to show him. </s>
<s>  i can't see that this is profitable. </s>
<s>  certainly it's the most distressing thing that ever has occurred for me. </s>
<s>  but i didn't feel that i could let you meet john gilman tonight without telling you what he knows. </s>
<s>  if you have any way to square your conscience and cleanse your soul before you meet him, you had better do it, for he is a mighty fine man and if you lose him you will have lost the best chance that is likely ever to come to you. </s>
<s> " linda sat studying eileen. </s>
<s>  she saw the gallant effort she was making to keep her self-possession, to think with her accustomed rapidity, to strike upon some scheme whereby she could square herself. </s>
<s>  she rose and started toward the door. </s>
<s>  "what you'll say to john i haven't the faintest notion," she said. </s>
<s>  "i told him very little. </s>
<s>  i just showed him. </s>
<s> " then she went out and closed the door after her. </s>
<s>  at the foot of the stairs she met katy admitting gilman. </s>
<s>  without any preliminaries she said: "i repeat, john, that i am sorry for what happened the other day. </s>
<s>  i have just come from eileen. </s>
<s>  she will be down as soon as katy tells her you're here, no doubt. </s>
<s>  i have done what i told you i would. </s>
<s>  she knows what i showed you so you needn't employ any subterfuges. </s>
<s>  you can be frank and honest with each other. </s>
<s> " "i wish to god we could," said john gilman. </s>
<s>  linda went to her work. </s>
<s>  she decided that she would gauge what happened by the length of time john stayed. </s>
<s>  if he remained only a few minutes it would indicate that there had been a rupture. </s>
<s>  if he stayed as long as he usually did, the chances were that eileen's wit had triumphed as usual. </s>
<s>  at twelve o'clock linda laid her pencils in the box, washed the brushes, and went down the back stairs to the ice chest for a glass of milk. </s>
<s>  the living room was still lighted and linda thought eileen's laugh quite as gay as she ever had heard it. </s>
<s>  linda closed her lips very tight and slowly climbed the stairs. </s>
<s>  when she entered her room she walked up to the mirror and stared at herself in the glass for a long time, and then of herself she asked this question: "well, how do you suppose she did it?" chapter xviii. </s>
<s>  spanish iris just as linda was most deeply absorbed with her own concerns there came a letter from marian which linda read and reread several times. </s>
<s>  for marian wrote: my dearest pal: life is so busy up san francisco way that it makes lilac valley look in retrospection like a peaceful sunset preliminary to bed time. </s>
<s>  but i want you to have the consolation and the comfort of knowing that i have found at least two friends that i hope will endure. </s>
<s>  one is a woman who has a room across the hall from mine in my apartment house. </s>
<s>  she is a newspaper woman and life is very full for her, but it is filled with such intensely interesting things that i almost regret having made my life work anything so prosaic as inanimate houses. </s>
<s>  but then it's my dream to enliven each house i plan with at least the spirit of home. </s>
<s>  this woman--her name is dana meade--enlivens every hour of her working day with something concerning the welfare of humanity. </s>
<s>  she is a beautiful woman in her soul, so extremely beautiful that i can't at this minute write you a detailed description of her hair and her eyes and her complexion, because this nice, big, friendly light that radiates from her so lights her up and transfigures her that everyone says how beautiful she is, and yet i have a vague recollection that her nose is what you would call a "beak," and i am afraid her cheek bones are too high for good proportion, and i know that her hair is not always so carefully dressed as it should be, but what is the difference when the hair is crowned with a halo? i can't swear to any of these things. </s>
<s>  they are sketchy impressions. </s>
<s>  the only thing i am absolutely sure about is the inner light that shines to an unbelievable degree. </s>
<s>  i wish she had more time and i wish i had more time and that she and i might become such friends as you and i are. </s>
<s>  i can't tell you, dear, how much i think of you. </s>
<s>  it seems to me that you're running a sort of undercurrent in my thoughts all day long. </s>
<s>  you will hardly credit it, linda, but a few days ago i drove a car through the thickest traffic, up a steep hill, and round a curve. </s>
<s>  i did it, but practically collapsed when it was over. </s>
<s>  the why of it was this: i think i told you before that in the offices of nicholson and snow there is a man who is an understanding person. </s>
<s>  he is the junior partner and his name is eugene snow. </s>
<s>  i happened to arrive at his desk the day i came for my instructions and to make my plans for entering their contest. </s>
<s>  he was very kind to me and went out of his way to smooth out the rough places. </s>
<s>  ever since, he makes a point of coming to me and talking a few minutes when i am at the office or when he passes me on my way to the drafting rooms where i take my lessons. </s>
<s>  the day i mention i had worked late and hard the night before. </s>
<s>  i had done the last possible thing to the plans for my dream house. </s>
<s>  at the last minute, getting it all on paper, working at the specifications, at which you know i am wobbly, was nervous business. </s>
<s>  and when i came from the desk after having turned in my plans, perhaps i showed fatigue. </s>
<s>  anyway, he said to me that his car was below. </s>
<s>  he said also that he was a lonely person, having lost his wife two years ago, and not being able very frequently to see his little daughter who is in the care of her grandmother, there were times when he was hungry for the companionship he had lost. </s>
<s>  he asked me if i would go with him for a drive and i told him that i would. </s>
<s>  i am rather stunned yet over what happened. </s>
<s>  the runabout he led me to was greatly like yours,  linda, he stopped at a florist's and came out with an armload of bloom--exquisite lavender and pale pink and faint yellow and waxen white--the most enticing armload of spring. </s>
<s>  for one minute i truly experienced a thrill. </s>
<s>  i thought he was going to give that mass of flowers to me, but he did not. </s>
<s>  he merely laid it across my lap and said: "edith adored the flowers from bulbs. </s>
<s>  i never see such bloom that my heart does not ache with a keen, angry ache to think that she should be taken from the world, and the beauty that she so loved, so early and so ruthlessly. </s>
<s>  we'll take her these as i would take them to her were she living. </s>
<s> " so, linda dear, i sat there and looked at color and drank in fragrance, and we whirled through the city and away to a cemetery on a beautiful hill, and filled a vase inside the gates of a mausoleum with these appealing flowers. </s>
<s>  then we sat down, and a man with a hurt heart told me about his hurt, and what an effort he was making to get through the world as the woman he loved would have had him. </s>
<s>  and before i knew what i was doing, linda, i told him the tellable part of my own hurts. </s>
<s>  i even lifted my turban and bowed my white head before him. </s>
<s>  this hurt--it was one of the inexorable things that come to people in this world--i could talk about. </s>
<s>  that deeper hurt, which has put a scar that never will be effaced on my soul, of course i could not tell him about. </s>
<s>  but when we went back to the car he said to me that he would help me to get back into the sunlight. </s>
<s>  he said the first thing i must do to regain self-confidence was to begin driving again. </s>
<s>  i told him i could not, but he said i must, and made me take the driver's seat of a car i had never seen and take the steering wheel of a make of machine i had never driven, and tackle two or three serious problems for a driver. </s>
<s>  i did it all right, linda, because i couldn't allow myself to fail the kind of a man mr. </s>
<s>  snow is, when he was truly trying to help me, but in the depths of my heart i am afraid i am a coward forever, for there is a ghastly illness takes possession of me as i write these details to you. </s>
<s>  but anyway, put a red mark on your calendar beside the date on which you get this letter, and joyfully say to yourself that marian has found two real, sympathetic friends. </s>
<s>  in a week or ten days i shall know about the contest. </s>
<s>  if 1: win, as i really have a sneaking hope that i shall, since i have condensed the best of two dozen houses into one and exhausted my imagination on my dream home, i will surely telegraph, and you can make it a day of jubilee. </s>
<s>  if i fail, i will try to find out where my dream was not true and what can be done to make it materialize properly. </s>
<s>  but between us, linda girl, i am going to be dreadfully disappointed. </s>
<s>  i could use the material value that prize represents. </s>
<s>  i could start my life work which i hope to do in lilac valley on the prestige and the background that it would give me. </s>
<s>  i don't know, linda, whether you ever learned to pray or not, but i have, and it's a thing that helps when the black shadow comes, when you reach the land of "benefits forgot and friends remembered not. </s>
<s> " and this reminds me that i should not write to my very dearest friend who has her own problems and make her heart sad with mine. </s>
<s>  so to the joyful news of my two friends add a third, linda, for i am going to tell you a secret because it will make you happy. </s>
<s>  since i have been in san francisco some man, who for a reason of his own does not tell me his name, has been writing me extremely attractive letters. </s>
<s>  i have had several of them and i can't tell you, linda, what they mean to me or how they help me. </s>
<s>  there is a touch of whimsy about them. </s>
<s>  i can't as yet connect them with anybody i ever met, but to me they are taking the place of a little lunch on the bread of life. </s>
<s>  they are such real, such vivid, such alive letters from such a real person that i have been doing the very foolish and romantic thing of answering them as my heart dictates and signing my own name to them, which on the surface looks unwise when the man in the case keeps his identity in the background. </s>
<s>  but since he knows me and knows my name it seems useless to do anything else: and answer these letters i shall and must. </s>
<s>  because every one of them is to me a strong light thrown on john gilman. </s>
<s>  every time one of these letters comes to me i have the feeling that i would like to reach out through space and pick up the man who is writing them and dangle him before eileen and say to her: "take him. </s>
<s>  i dare you to take him. </s>
<s> " and my confidence, linda, is positively supreme that she could not do it. </s>
<s>  you know, between us, linda, we regarded eileen as a rare creature, a kind of exotic thing, made to be kept in a glass house with tempered air and warmed water. </s>
<s>  but as i go about the city and at times amuse myself at concerts and theaters, i am rather dazed to tell you, honey, that the world is chock full of eileens. </s>
<s>  on the streets, in the stores, everywhere i go, sometimes half a dozen times in a day i say to myself: "there goes eileen. </s>
<s> " i haven't a doubt that eileen has a heart, if it has not become so calloused that nobody could ever reach it, and i suspect she has a soul, but the more i see of her kind the more i feel that john gilman may have to breast rather black water before he finds them. </s>
<s>  with dearest love, be sure to remember me to katherine o'donovan. </s>
<s>  hug her tight and give her my unqualified love. </s>
<s>  don't let her forget me. </s>
<s>  as ever, marian. </s>
<s>   this was the letter that linda read once, then she read it again and then she read it a third time, and after that she lost count and reread it whenever she was not busy doing something else, for it was a letter that was the next thing to laying hands upon marian. </s>
<s>  the part of the letter concerning the unknown man who was writing marian, linda pondered over deeply. </s>
<s>  "that is the best thing i ever did in my life," she said in self- commendation. </s>
<s>  "it's doing more than i hoped it would. </s>
<s>  it's giving marian something to think about. </s>
<s>  it's giving her an interest in life. </s>
<s>  it's distracting her attention. </s>
<s>  without saying a word about john gilman it is making her see for herself the weak spots in him through the very subtle method of calling her attention to the strength that may lie in another man. </s>
<s>  for once in your life, linda, you have done something strictly worth while. </s>
<s>  the thing for you to do is to keep it up, and in order to keep it up, to make each letter fresh and original, you will have to do a good deal of sticking around peter morrison's location and absorbing rather thoroughly the things he says. </s>
<s>  peter doesn't know he is writing those letters but he is in them till it's a wonder marian does not hear him drawl and see the imps twisting his lips as she reads them. </s>
<s>  before i write another single one i'll go see peter. </s>
<s>  maybe he will have that article written. </s>
<s>  i'll take a pencil, and as he reads i'll jot down the salient points and then i'll come home and work out a head and tail piece for him to send in with it, and in that way i'll ease my soul about the skylight and the fireplace. </s>
<s> " so linda took pad and pencils, raided katy for everything she could find that was temptingly edible, climbed into the bear cat, and went to see peter as frankly as she would have crossed the lawn to visit marian. </s>
<s>  he was not in the garage when she stopped her car before it, but the workmen told her that he had strolled up the mountain and that probably he would return soon. </s>
<s>  learning that he had been gone but a short time linda set the bear cat squalling at the top of its voice. </s>
<s>  then she took possession of the garage, and clearing peter's worktable spread upon it the food she had brought, and then started out to find some flowers for decorations. </s>
<s>  when peter came upon the scene he found linda, flushed and brilliant eyed, holding before him a big bouquet of alder bloom, the last of the lilacs she had found in a cool, shaded place, pink filaree, blue lupin, and white mahogany panicles. </s>
<s>  "peter," she cried. </s>
<s>  "you can't guess what i have been doing!" peter glanced at the flowers. </s>
<s>  "isn't it obvious?" he inquired. </s>
<s>  "no, it isn't," said linda, "because i am capable of two processes at once. </s>
<s>  the work of my hands is visible. </s>
<s>  with it i am going to decorate your table. </s>
<s>  you won't have to go down to the restaurant for your supper tonight because i have brought my supper up to share with you, and after we finish, you're going to read me your article as you have rewritten it. </s>
<s>  i am going to decorate it and we are going to make a hit with it that will be at least a start on the road to greater fame. </s>
<s>  what you see is material. </s>
<s>  you can pick it up, smell it, admire it and eat it. </s>
<s>  but what i have truly been doing is setting spanish iris for yards down one side of the bed of your stream. </s>
<s>  when i left it was a foot and a half high peter, and every blue that the sky ever knew in its loveliest moments, and a yellow that is the concentrated essence of the best gold from the heart of california. </s>
<s>  oh, peter, there is enchantment in the way i set it. </s>
<s>  there are irregular deep beds, and there are straggly places where there are only one or two in a ragged streak, and then it runs along the edge in a fringy rim, and then it stretches out in a marshy place that is going to have some other wild things, arrowheads, and orchids, and maybe a bunch of paint brush on a high, dry spot near by. </s>
<s>  i wish you could see it!" peter looked at linda reflectively and then he told her that he could see it. </s>
<s>  he fold her that he adored it, that he was crazy about her straggly continuity and her fringy border, but there was not one word of truth in what he said, because what he saw was a slender thing, willowy, graceful. </s>
<s>  roughened wavy black hair hanging half her length in heavy braids, dark eyes and bright cheeks, a vivid red line of mouth, and a bright brown line of freckles bridging a prominent and aristocratic nose. </s>
<s>  what he was seeing was a soul, a young thing, a thing he coveted with every nerve and fiber of his being. </s>
<s>  and while he glibly humored her in her vision of decorating his brook, in his own consciousness he was saying to himself: "is there any reason why i should not try for her?" and then he answered himself. </s>
<s>  "there is no reason in your life. </s>
<s>  there is nothing ugly that could offend her or hurt her. </s>
<s>  the reason, the real reason, probably lies in the fact that if she were thinking of caring for anyone it would be for that attractive young schoolmate she brought up here for me to exercise my wits upon. </s>
<s>  it is very likely that she regards me in the light of a grandfatherly person to whom she can come with her joys or her problems, as frankly as she has now. </s>
<s> " so peter asked if the irises crossed the brook and ran down both sides. </s>
<s>  linda sat on a packing case and concentrated on the iris, and finally she announced that they did. </s>
<s>  she informed him that his place was going to bc natural, that nature evolved things in her own way. </s>
<s>  she did not grow irises down one side of a brook and arrowheads down the other. </s>
<s>  they waded across and flew across and visited back and forth, riding the water or the wind or the down of a bee or the tail of a cow. </s>
<s>  as she served the supper she had brought she very gravely informed him that there would be iris on both sides of his brook, and cress and miners' lettuce under the bridge. </s>
<s>  and she knew exactly where the wild clematis grew that would whiten his embankment after his workmen had extracted the last root of poison oak. </s>
<s>  "it may not scorch you, peter," she said gravely, "but you must look out for the missus and the little things. </s>
<s>  i haven't definitely decided on her yet, but she looks a good deal like mary louise whiting to mc. </s>
<s>  i saw her the other day. </s>
<s>  she came to school after donald. </s>
<s>  i liked her looks so well that i said to myself: 'everybody talks about how fine she is. </s>
<s>  i shouldn't wonder if i had better save her for peter'. </s>
<s>  but if i decide to, you should act that poison stuff out, because it's sure as shooting to attack any one with the soft, delicate skin that goes with a golden head. </s>
<s> " "oh, let's leave it in," said peter, "and dispense with the golden head. </s>
<s>  by the time you get that stream planted as you're planning, i'll have become so accustomed to a dark head bobbing up and down beside it that i won't take kindly to a sorrel top. </s>
<s> " "that is positively sacrilegious," said linda, lifting her hands to her rough black hair. </s>
<s>  "never in my life saw anything lovelier than the rich gold on louise whiting's bare head as she bent to release her brakes and start her car. </s>
<s>  a black head looks like a cinder bed beside it. </s>
<s>  and only think what a sunburst it will be when mary louise kneels down beside the iris. </s>
<s> " when they had finished their supper linda gathered up the remnants and put them in the car, then she laid a notebook and pencil on the table. </s>
<s>  "now i want to hear that article," she said. </s>
<s>  "i knew you would do it over the minute i was gone, and i knew you would keep it to read to me before you sent it. </s>
<s> " "hm," said peter. </s>
<s>  "is it second sight or psychoanalysis or telepathy, or what?" "mostly 'what'," laughed linda. </s>
<s>  "i merely knew. </s>
<s>  the workmen are gone and everything is quiet now, peter. </s>
<s>  begin. </s>
<s>  i am crazy to get the particular angle from which you 'make the world safe for democracy. </s>
<s> ' john used to call our attention to your articles during the war. </s>
<s>  he said we had not sent another man to france who could write as humanely and as interestingly as you did. </s>
<s>  i wish i had kept those articles. </s>
<s>  because i didn't get anything from them to compare with what i can get since i have a slight acquaintance with the procession that marches around your mouth. </s>
<s>  peter, you will have to watch that mouth of yours. </s>
<s>  it's an awfully betraying feature. </s>
<s>  so long as it's occupied with politics and the fads and the foibles and the sins and the foolishness and the extravagances of humanity, it's all very well. </s>
<s>  but if you ever get in trouble or if ever your heart hurts, or you get mad enough to kill somebody, that mouth of yours is going to be a most awfully revealing feature, peter. </s>
<s>  you will have hard work to settle it down into hard-and-fast noncommittal lines. </s>
<s> " peter looked at the girl steadily. </s>
<s>  "have you specialized on my mouth?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "huh-umph!" said linda, shaking her head vigorously. </s>
<s>  when i specialize i use a pin and a microscope and go right to the root of matters as i was taught. </s>
<s>  this is superficial. </s>
<s>  i am extemporizing now. </s>
<s> " "well, if this is extemporizing," said peter, "god help my soul if you ever go at me with a pin and a microscope. </s>
<s> " "oh, but i won't!" cried linda. </s>
<s>  "it wouldn't be kind to pin your friends on a setting board and use a microscope on them. </s>
<s>  you might see things that were strictly private. </s>
<s>  you might see things they wouldn't want you to see. </s>
<s>  they might not be your friends any more if you did that. </s>
<s>  when i make a friend i just take him on trust like i did donald. </s>
<s>  you're my friend, aren't you, peter?" "yes, linda," said peter soberly. </s>
<s>  "put me to any test you can think of if you want proof. </s>
<s> " "but i don't believe in proving friends, either," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i believe in nurturing them. </s>
<s>  i would set a friend in my garden and water his feet and turn the sunshine on him and tell him to stay there and grow. </s>
<s>  i might fertilize him, i might prune him, and i might use insecticide on him. </s>
<s>  i might spray him with rather stringent solutions, but i give you my word i would not test him. </s>
<s>  if he flourished under my care i would know it, and if he did not i would know it, and that would be all i would want to know. </s>
<s>  i have watched daddy search for the seat of nervous disorders, and sometimes he had to probe very deep to find what developed nerves unduly but he didn't ever do any picking and raveling and fringing at the soul of a human being merely for the sake of finding out what it was made of. </s>
<s>  and everyone says i am like him. </s>
<s> " "i wish i might have known him," said peter. </s>
<s>  "don't i wish it!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "now then, peter, go ahead. </s>
<s>  read your article. </s>
<s> " peter opened a packing case, picked out a sheaf of papers, and sitting opposite linda, began to read. </s>
<s>  he was dumbfounded to find that he, a man who had read and talked extemporaneously before great bodies of learned men, should have cold feet and shaking hands and a hammering heart because he was trying to read an article on america for americans before a high-school junior. </s>
<s>  but presently, as the theme engrossed him, he forgot the vision of linda interesting herself in his homemaking, and saw instead a vision of his country threatened on one side by the red menace of the bolshevik, on the other by the yellow menace of the jap, and yet on another by the treachery of the mexican and the slowly uprising might of the black man, and presently he was thundering his best-considered arguments at linda until she imperceptibly drew back from him on the packing case, and with parted lips and wide eyes she listened in utter absorption. </s>
<s>  she gazed at a transformed peter with aroused eyes and a white light of patriotism on his forehead, and a conception even keener than anything that the war had brought her young soul was burning in her heart of what a man means when he tries to express his feeling concerning the land of his birth. </s>
<s>  presently, without realizing what she was doing, she reached for her pad and pencils and rapidly began sketching a stretch of peaceful countryside over which a coming storm of gigantic proportions was gathering. </s>
<s>  fired by peter's article, the touch of genius in linda's soul became creative and she fashioned huge storm clouds wind driven, that floated in such a manner as to bring the merest suggestion of menacing faces, black faces, yellow faces, brown faces, and under the flash of lightning, just at the obscuring of the sun, a huge, evil, leering red face. </s>
<s>  she swept a stroke across her sheet and below this she began again, sketching the same stretch of country she had pictured above, strolling in cultivated fields, dotting it with white cities, connecting it with smooth roadways, sweeping the sky with giant planes. </s>
<s>  at one side, winging in from the glow of morning, she drew in the strong-winged flight of a flock of sea swallows, peacefully homing toward the far-distant ocean. </s>
<s>  she was utterly unaware when peter stopped reading. </s>
<s>  absorbed, she bent over her work. </s>
<s>  when she had finished she looked up. </s>
<s>  "now i'll take this home," she said. </s>
<s>  "i can't do well on color with pencils. </s>
<s>  you hold that article till i have time to put this on water-color paper and touch it up a bit here and there, and i believe it will be worthy of starting and closing your article. </s>
<s> " she pushed the sketches toward him. </s>
<s>  "you little wonder!" said peter softly. </s>
<s>  "yes, 'little' is good," scoffed linda, rising to very nearly his height and reaching for the lunch basket. </s>
<s>  " 'little' is good, peter. </s>
<s>  if i could do what i like to myself i would get in some kind of a press and squash down about seven inches. </s>
<s> " "oh, lord!" said peter. </s>
<s>  "forget it. </s>
<s>  what's the difference what the inches of your body are so long as your brain has a stature worthy of mention?" "good-bye!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "on the strength of that i'll jazz that sketch all up, bluey and red-purple and jade-green. </s>
<s>  i 11 make it as glorious as a catalina sunset. </s>
<s> " as she swung the car around the sharp curve at the boulders she looked back and laughingly waved her hand at peter, and peter experienced a wild desire to shriek lest she lose control of the car and plunge down the steep incline. </s>
<s>  a second later, when he saw her securely on the road below, he smiled to himself. </s>
<s>  "proves one thing," he said conclusively. </s>
<s>  "she is over the horrors. </s>
<s>  she is driving unconsciously. </s>
<s>  thank god she knew that curve so well she could look the other way and drive it mentally. </s>
<s>  chapter xix. </s>
<s>  the official bug-catcher not a mile below the exit from peter's grounds, linda perceived a heavily laden person toiling down the roadway before her and when she ran her car abreast and stopped it, henry anderson looked up at her with joyful face. </s>
<s>  "sorry i can't uncover, fair lady," he said, "but you see i am very much otherwise engaged. </s>
<s> " what linda saw was a tired, disheveled man standing in the roadway beside her car, under each arm a boulder the size of her head, one almost jet-black, shot through with lines of white and flying figures of white crossing between these bands that almost reminded one of winged dancers. </s>
<s>  the other was a combination stone made up of matrix thickly imbedded with pebbles of brown, green, pink, and dull blue. </s>
<s>  "for pity's sake!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "where are you going and why are you personally demonstrating a new method of transporting rock?" "i am on my way down lilac valley to the residence of a friend of mine," said henry anderson. </s>
<s>  "i heard her say the other day that she saved every peculiarly marked boulder she could find to preserve coolness and moisture in her fern bed. </s>
<s> " linda leaned over and opened the car door. </s>
<s>  "all well and good," she said. </s>
<s>  "but why in the cause of reason didn't you leave them at peter's and bring them down in his car?" henry anderson laid the stones in the bottom of the car, stepped in and closed the door behind him. </s>
<s>  he drew a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his perspiring face and soiled hands. </s>
<s>  "i had two sufficient personal reasons," he said. </s>
<s>  "one was that the car at our place is peter morrison's car, not mine. </s>
<s>  and the other was that it's none of anybody's business but my own if i choose to 'say it' with stones. </s>
<s> " linda started the car, being liberal with gas--so liberal that it was only a few minutes till henry anderson protested. </s>
<s>  "this isn't the speedway," he said. </s>
<s>  "what's your hurry?" "two reasons seem to be all that are allowed for things at the present minute," answered linda. </s>
<s>  "one of mine is that you can't drive this beast slow, and the other is that my workroom is piled high with things i should be doing. </s>
<s>  i have two sketches i must complete while i am in the mood, and i have had a great big letter from my friend, marian thorne, today that i want to answer before i go to bed tonight. </s>
<s> " "in other words," said henry anderson bluntly, "you want me to understand that when i have reached your place and dumped these stones i can beat it. </s>
<s>  you have no further use for me. </s>
<s> " "you said that," retorted linda. </s>
<s>  "and who ever heard of such a thing," said henry, "as a young woman sending away a person of my numerous charms and attractions in order to work, or to write a letter to another woman?" "but you're not taking into consideration," said linda, "that i must work, and i scarcely know you, while i have known marian ever since i was four years old and she is my best friend. </s>
<s> " "well, she has no advantage over me" said henry instantly, "because i have known you quite as long as peter morrison has at least, and i am your official bug-catcher. </s>
<s> " "i had almost forgotten about the bugs," said linda. </s>
<s>  "well, don't for a minute think i am going to give you an opportunity to forget," said henry anderson. </s>
<s>  he reached across and laid his hand over linda's on the steering gear. </s>
<s>  linda said nothing, neither did she move. </s>
<s>  she merely added more gas and put the bear cat forward at a dizzy whirl. </s>
<s>  henry laughed. </s>
<s>  "that's all right, my beauty," he said. </s>
<s>  "don't you think for a minute that i can't ride as fast as you can drive. </s>
<s> " a dull red mottled linda's cheeks. </s>
<s>  as quickly as it could be done she brought the bear cat to a full stop. </s>
<s>  then she turned and looked at henry anderson. </s>
<s>  the expression in her eyes was disconcerting even to that cheeky young individual--he had not borne her gaze a second until he removed his hand. </s>
<s>  "thanks," said linda in a dry drawl. </s>
<s>  "and you will add to my obligation if in the future you will remember not to deal in assumptions. </s>
<s>  i am not your 'beauty,' and i am not anyone's beauty. </s>
<s>  while the only thing in this world that i am interested in at present is to get the best education i can and at the same time carry on work that i love to do. </s>
<s>  i have a year to finish my course in the high school and when i finish i will only have a good beginning for whatever i decide to study next. </s>
<s> " "that's nothing," said the irrepressible henry. </s>
<s>  "it will take me two years to catch a sufficient number of gold bugs to be really serious, but there wouldn't be any harm in having a mutual understanding and something definite to work for, and then we might be able, you know, to cut out some of that year of high- school grinding. </s>
<s>  if the plans i have submitted in the nicholson and snow contest should just happen to be the prize winners, that would put matters in such a shape for young henry that he could devote himself to crickets and tumble-bugs at once. </s>
<s> " "don't you think," said linda quietly, "that you would better forget that silly jesting and concentrate the best of your brains on improving your plans for peter morrison's house?" "why, surely i will if that's what you command me to do," said henry, purposely misunderstanding her. </s>
<s>  "you haven't mentioned before," said linda, "that you had submitted plans in that san francisco contest. </s>
<s> " "all done and gone," said henry anderson lightly. </s>
<s>  "i had an inspiration one day and i saw a way to improve a house with comforts and conveniences i never had thought of before. </s>
<s>  i was enthusiastic over the production when i got it on paper and figured it. </s>
<s>  it's exactly the house that i am going to build for peter, and when i have cut my eye teeth on it i am going to correct everything possible and build it in perfection for you. </s>
<s> " "look here," said linda soberly, "i am not accustomed to this sort of talk. </s>
<s>  i don't care for it. </s>
<s>  if you want to preserve even the semblance of friendship with me you must stop it, and get to impersonal matters and stay there. </s>
<s> " "all right," he agreed instantly, "but if you don't like my line of talk, you're the first girl i ever met that didn't. </s>
<s> " "you have my sympathy," said linda gravely. </s>
<s>  "you have been extremely unfortunate. </s>
<s> " then she started the bear cat, and again running at undue speed she reached her wild-flower garden. </s>
<s>  henry anderson placed the stones as she directed and waited for an invitation to come in, but the invitation was not given. </s>
<s>  linda thanked him for the stones. </s>
<s>  she told him that in combination with a few remaining from the mantel they would make all she would require, and excusing herself she drove to the garage. </s>
<s>  when she came in she found the irrepressible henry sitting on the back steps explaining to katy the strenuous time he had had finding and carrying down the stones they had brought. </s>
<s>  katy had a plate of refreshments ready to hand him when linda laughingly passed them and went to her room. </s>
<s>  when she had finished her letter to marian she took a sheet of drawing paper, and in her most attractive lettering sketched in the heading, "a palate teaser," which was a direct quotation from katy. </s>
<s>  below she wrote: you will find tunas in the cacti thickets of any desert, but if you are so fortunate as to be able to reach specimens which were brought from mexico and set as hedges around the gardens of the old missions, you will find there the material for this salad in its most luscious form. </s>
<s>  naturally it can be made from either opuntia fiscus-indica or opuntia tuna, but a combination of these two gives the salad an exquisite appearance and a tiny touch more delicious flavor, because tuna, which is red, has to my taste a trifle richer and fuller flavor than indica, which is yellow. </s>
<s>  both fruits taste more like the best well-ripened watermelon than any other i recall. </s>

<s>  in case you live in san diego county or farther south, where it is possible to secure the scarlet berries of the strawberry cactus-- it is the mammillaria goodridgei species that you should use--a beautiful decoration for finishing your salad can be made from the red strawberries of these. </s>
<s>  if you live too far north to find these, you may send your salad to the table beautifully decorated by cutting fancy figures from the red tuna, or by slicing it lengthwise into oblong pieces and weaving them into a decoration over the yellow background. </s>

<s>  gigantic specimens of fruit-bearing cacti can be found all over the sunland desert near to the city, but they are not possessed of the full flavor of the cultivated old mission growths, so that it is well worth your while to make a trip to the nearest of these for the fruit with which to prepare this salad. </s>

<s>  if you should hear the music of worship ascending from the throats of benedictine fathers leading a clamoring choir of the blended voices of spaniard, mexican, and indian, combining with the music of the bells and the songs of the mocking birds, nest making among the tunas, it will be good for your soul in the line of purging it from selfishness, since in this day we are not asked to give all of life to the service of others, only a reasonable part of it. </s>
<s>  linda read this over, working in changes here and there, then she picked up her pencil and across the top of her sheet indicated an open sky with scarcely a hint of cloud. </s>
<s>  across the bottom she outlined a bit of sunland desert she well remembered, in the foreground a bed of flat-leaved nopal, flowering red and yellow, the dark red prickly pears, edible, being a near relative of the fruits she had used in her salad. </s>
<s>  after giving the prickly pear the place of honor to the left, in higher growth she worked in the slender, cylindrical, jointed stems of the cholla, shading the flowers a paler, greenish yellow. </s>
<s>  on the right, balancing the cholla, she drew the oval, cylindrical columns of the hedgehog cactus, and the color touch of the big magenta flowers blended exquisitely with the color she already had used. </s>
<s>  at the left, the length of her page, she drew a gigantic specimen of opuntia tuna, covered with flowers, and well-developed specimens of the pears whose coloring ran into the shades of the hedgehog cactus. </s>
<s>  she was putting away her working materials when she heard steps and voices on the stairs, so she knew that eileen and john gilman were coming. </s>
<s>  she did not in the least want them, yet she could think of no excuse for refusing them admission that would not seem ungracious. </s>
<s>  she hurried to the wall, snatched down the paintings for peter morrison, and looked around to see how she could dispose of them. </s>
<s>  she ended by laying one of them in a large drawer which she pushed shut and locked. </s>
<s>  the other she placed inside a case in the wall which formerly had been used for billiard cues. </s>
<s>  at their second tap she opened the door. </s>
<s>  eileen was not at her best. </s>
<s>  there was a worried look across her eyes, a restlessness visible in her movements, but gilman was radiant. </s>
<s>  "what do you think, linda?" he cried. </s>
<s>  "eileen has just named the day!" "i did no such thing," broke in eileen. </s>
<s>  "your pardon, fair lady, you did not," said gilman. </s>
<s>  "that was merely a figure of speech. </s>
<s>  i meant named the month. </s>
<s>  she has definitely promised in october, and i may begin to hunt a location and plan a home for us. </s>
<s>  i want the congratulations of my dear friend and my dearer sister. </s>
<s> " linda held out her hand and smiled as bravely as she could. </s>
<s>  "i am very glad you are so pleased, john," she said quietly, "and i hope that you will be as happy as you deserve to be. </s>
<s> " "now exactly what do you mean by that?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "oh, linda prides herself on being deep and subtle and conveying hidden meanings," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "she means what a thousand people will tell you in the coming months: merely that they hope you will be happy. </s>
<s> " "of course," linda hastened to corroborate, wishing if possible to avoid any unpleasantness. </s>
<s>  "you certainly have an attractive workroom here," said john, "much as i hate to see it spoiled for billiards. </s>
<s> " "it's too bad," said linda, "that i have spoiled it for you for billiards. </s>
<s>  i have also spoiled the outside appearance of the house for eileen. </s>
<s> " "oh, i don't know," said john. </s>
<s>  "i looked at it carefully the other day as i came up, and i thought your changes enhanced the value of the property. </s>
<s> " "i am surely glad to hear that," said linda. </s>
<s>  "take a look through my skylight and my new window. </s>
<s>  imagine you see the rugs i am going to have and a few more pieces of furniture when i can afford them. </s>
<s>  and let me particularly point out the fireplace that henry anderson and your friend peter designed and had built for me. </s>
<s>  doesn't it add a soul and a heart to my study?" john gilman walked over and looked at the fireplace critically. </s>
<s>  he read the lines aloud, then he turned to eileen. </s>
<s>  "why, that is perfectly beautiful," he said. </s>
<s>  "let's duplicate it in our home. </s>
<s> " "you bungler!" scoffed eileen. </s>
<s>  "i think you're right," said gilman reflectively, "exactly right. </s>
<s>  of course i would have no business copying linda's special fireplace where the same people would see it frequently. </s>
<s>  and if i had stopped to think a second, i might have known that you would prefer tiling to field stone. </s>
<s> " "linda seems very busy tonight," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "perhaps we are bothering her. </s>
<s> " "yes," said john, "we'll go at once. </s>
<s>  i had to run up to tell our good news. </s>
<s>  and i wanted to tell you too, linda dear, that i think both of us misjudged eileen the other day. </s>
<s>  you know, linda, you have always dressed according to your father's ideas, which were so much simpler and plainer than the manner in which your mother dressed eileen, that she merely thought that you wished to continue in his way. </s>
<s>  she had no objection to your having any kind of clothes you chose, if only you had confided in her, and explained to her what you wanted. </s>
<s> " linda stood beside her table, one lean hand holding down the letter she had been writing. </s>
<s>  she stood very still, but she was powerless to raise her eyes to the face of either john or eileen. </s>
<s>  above everything she did not wish to go any further in revealing eileen to john gilman. </s>
<s>  if he knew what he knew and if he felt satisfied, after what he had seen, with any explanation that eileen could trump up to offer, linda had no desire to carry the matter further. </s>
<s>  she had been ashamed of what she already had done. </s>
<s>  she had felt angry and dissatisfied with herself, so she stood before them downcast and silent. </s>
<s>  "and it certainly was a great joke on both of us," said john jovially, "what we thought about that box of cigarettes, you know. </s>
<s>  they were a prize given by a bridge club at an 'ambassador' benefit for the good samaritan hospital. </s>
<s>  eileen, the little card shark she is, won it, and she was keeping it hidden away there to use as a gift for my birthday. </s>
<s>  since we disclosed her plans prematurely, she gave it to me at once, and i am having a great time treating all my friends. </s>
<s> " at that instant linda experienced a revulsion. </s>
<s>  previously she had not been able to raise her eyes. </s>
<s>  now it would have been quite impossible to avoid looking straight into eileen's face. </s>
<s>  but eileen had no intention of meeting anyone's gaze at that minute. </s>
<s>  she was fidgeting with a sheet of drawing paper. </s>
<s>  "careful you don't bend that," cautioned linda. </s>
<s>  then she looked at john gilman. </s>
<s>  he believed what he was saying. </s>
<s>  he was happy again. </s>
<s>  linda evolved the best smile she could. </s>
<s>  "how stupid of us not to have guessed!" she said. </s>
<s>  closing the door behind them, linda leaned against it and looked up through the skylight at the creep blue of the night, the low-hung stars. </s>
<s>  how long she stood there she did not know. </s>
<s>  presently she went to her chair, picked up her pencil, and slowly began to draw. </s>
<s>  at first she scarcely realized what she was doing, then she became absorbed in her work. </s>
<s>  then she reached for her color box and brushes, and shortly afterward tacked against the wall an extremely clever drawing of a greatly enlarged wasp. </s>
<s>  skillfully she had sketched a face that was recognizable round the big insect eyes. </s>
<s>  she had surmounted the face by a fluff of bejewelled yellow curls, encased the hind legs upon which the creature stood upright in pink velvet turkish trousers and put tiny gold shoes on the feet. </s>
<s>  she greatly exaggerated the wings into long trails and made them of green gauze with ruffled edges. </s>
<s>  all the remainder of the legs she had transformed into so many braceleted arms, each holding a tiny fan, or a necklace, a jewel box, or a handkerchief of lace. </s>
<s>  she stood before this sketch, studying it for a few minutes, then she walked over to the table and came back with a big black pencil. </s>
<s>  steadying her hand with a mahl stick rested against the wall, with one short sharp stroke she drew a needle-pointed stinger, so screened by the delicate wings that it could not be seen unless you scrutinized the picture minutely. </s>
<s>  after that, with careful, interested hands she brought out peter morrison's drawings and replaced them on the wall to dry. </s>
<s>  chapter xx. </s>
<s>  the cap sheaf toward the last of the week linda began to clear the mental decks of her ship of life in order that she might have saturday free for her promised day with donald. </s>
<s>  she had decided that they would devote that day to wave-beaten laguna. </s>
<s>  it was a long drive but delightful. </s>
<s>  it ran over the old king's highway between miles of orange and lemon orchards in full flower, bordered by other miles of roses in their prime. </s>
<s>  every minute when her mind was not actively occupied with her lessons or her recipes linda was dreaming of the king's highway. </s>
<s>  almost unconsciously she began to chant: "all in the golden weather, forth let us ride today, you and i together on the king's highway, the blue skies above us, and below the shining sea. </s>
<s>  there's many a road to travel, but it's this road for me. </s>
<s> " you must have ridden this road with an understanding heart and the arm of god around you to know the exact degree of disappointment that swelled in linda's heart when she answered the telephone early saturday morning and heard donald whiting's strained voice speaking into it. </s>
<s>  he was talking breathlessly in eager, boyish fashion. </s>
<s>  "linda, i am in a garage halfway downtown," he was saying, "and it looks to me as if to save my soul i couldn't reach you before noon. </s>
<s>  i have had the darnedest luck. </s>
<s>  our jap got sick last week and he sent a new man to take his place. </s>
<s>  there wasn't a thing the matter with our car when i drove it in friday night. </s>
<s>  this morning father wanted to use it on important business, and it wouldn't run. </s>
<s>  he ordered me to tinker it up enough to get it to the shop. </s>
<s>  i went at it and when it would go, i started you can imagine the clip i was going, and the thing went to pieces. </s>
<s>  i don't know yet how it comes that i saved my skin. </s>
<s>  i am pretty badly knocked out, but i'll get there by noon if it's a possible thing. </s>
<s> " "oh, that's all right," said linda, fervently hoping that the ache in her throat would not tincture her voice. </s>
<s>  it was half-past eleven when donald came. </s>
<s>  linda could not bring herself to give up the sea that day. </s>
<s>  she found it impossible to drive the king's highway. </s>
<s>  it seemed equally impossible not to look on the face of the ocean, so she compromised by skirting santa monica bay, and taking the foothill road she ran it to the north end of the beach drive. </s>
<s>  when they had spread their blankets on the s finished their lunch and were resting, linda began to question donald about what had happened. </s>
<s>  she wanted to know how long whitings' gardener had been in their employ. </s>
<s>  if they knew where he lived and about his family. </s>
<s>  if they knew who his friends were, or anything concerning him. </s>
<s>  she inquired about the man who had taken his place, and wanted most particularly to know what the garage men had found the trouble with a car that ran perfectly on friday night and broke down in half a dozen different places on saturday morning. </s>
<s>  finally donald looked at her, laughingly quizzical. </s>
<s>  "linda," he said, "you're no nerve specialist and no naturalist. </s>
<s>  you're the cross examiner for the plaintiff. </s>
<s>  what are you trying to get at? make out a case against yogo sani?" "of course it's all right," said linda, watching a distant pelican turn head down and catapult into the sea. </s>
<s>  "it has to be all right, but you must admit that it looks peculiar. </s>
<s>  how have you been getting along this week?" donald waved his hand in the direction of a formation of stone the size of a small house. </s>
<s>   "been rolling that to the top of the mountain," he said lightly. </s>
<s>  linda's eyes narrowed, her face grew speculative. </s>
<s>  she looked at donald intently. </s>
<s>  "is it as difficult as that?" she asked in a lowered voice as if the surf and the sea chickens might hear. </s>
<s>  "it is just as difficult as that," said donald. </s>
<s>  "while you're talking about peculiar things, i'll tell you one. </s>
<s>  in class i came right up against oka sayye on the solution of a theorem in trigonometry. </s>
<s>  we both had the answer, the correct answer, but we had arrived at it by widely different routes, and it was up to me to prove that my line of reasoning was more lucid, more natural, the inevitable one by which the solution should be reached. </s>
<s>  we got so in earnest that i am afraid both of us were rather tense. </s>
<s>  i stepped over to his demonstration to point out where i thought his reasoning was wrong. </s>
<s>  i got closer to the jap than i had ever been before. </s>
<s>  and by gracious, linda! scattered, but nevertheless still there, and visible, i saw a sprinkling of gray hairs just in front of and over his ears. </s>
<s>  it caught me unawares, and before i knew what i was doing, before the professor and the assembled classroom i blurted it out: 'say, oka sayye, how old are you?' if the jap had had any way of killing me, i believe he would have done it. </s>
<s>  there was a look in his eyes that was what i would call deadly. </s>
<s>  it was only a flash and then, very courteously, putting me in the wrong, of course, he remarked that he was 'almost ninekleen'. </s>
<s>  and it struck me from his look and the way he said it that it was a lie. </s>
<s>  if he truly was the average age of the rest of the class there was nothing for him to be angry about. </s>
<s>  then i did take a deliberate survey. </s>
<s>  from the settled solidity of his frame and the shape of his hands and the skin of his face and the set of his eyes in his head, i couldn't see that much youth. </s>
<s>  i'll bet he is thirty if he is a day, and i shouldn't be a bit surprised if he has graduated at the most worthwhile university in japan, before he ever came to this country to get his english for nothing. </s>
<s> " linda was watching a sea swallow now, and slowly her lean fingers were gathering handfuls of sand and sifting them into a little pyramid she was heaping beside her. </s>
<s>  again almost under her breath she spoke. </s>
<s>  "donald, do you really believe that?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "is it possible that mature jap men are coming here and entering our schools and availing themselves of the benefits that the taxpayers of california provide for their children?" "didn't you know it?" asked donald. </s>
<s>  "i hadn't thought of it in connection with oka sayye, but i do know cases where mature japs have been in grade schools with children under ten. </s>
<s> " "oh, donald!" exclaimed linda. </s>
<s>  "if california is permitting that or ever has permitted it, we're too easy. </s>
<s>  we deserve to become their prey if we are so careless. </s>
<s> " "why, i know it's true," said donald. </s>
<s>  "i have been in the same classes with men more than old enough to be my father. </s>
<s> " "i never was," said linda, industriously sifting sand. </s>
<s>  "i have been in classes with japs ever since i have been at school, but it was with girls and boys of our gardeners and fruit dealers and curio-shop people, and they were always of my age and entitled to be in school, since our system includes the education of anybody who happens to be in california and wants to go to school. </s>
<s> " "did my being late spoil any particular plan you had made, linda?" "yes," said linda, "it did. </s>
<s> " "oh, i am so sorry!" cried donald. </s>
<s>  "i certainly shall try to see that it doesn't occur again. </s>
<s>  could we do it next saturday?" "i am hoping so," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i told dad," said donald, "where i wanted to go and what i wanted to do, and he was awfully sorry but he said it was business and it would take only a few minutes and he thought i could do it and be on time. </s>
<s>  if he had known i would be detained i don't believe he would have asked it of me. </s>
<s>  he is a grand old peter, linda. </s>
<s> "  "yes, i know," said linda. </s>
<s>  "there's not much you can tell me about peters of the grand sort, the real, true flesh-and-blood, bighearted, human-being fathers, who will take you to the fields and the woods and take the time to teach you what god made and how he made it and why he made it and what we can do with it, and of the fellowship and brotherhood we can get from nature by being real kin. </s>
<s>  the one thing that i have had that was the biggest thing in all this world was one of these real fathers. </s>
<s> " donald watched as she raised the pyramid higher and higher. </s>
<s>  "did you tell your father whom you were to go with?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "sure i did," said donald. </s>
<s>  "told the whole family at dinner last night. </s>
<s>  told 'em about all the things i was learning, from where to get soap off the bushes to the best spot for material for wooden legs or instantaneous relief for snake bite. </s>
<s> " "what did they say?" linda inquired laughingly. </s>
<s>  "unanimously in favour of continuing the course," he said. </s>
<s>  "i had already told father about you when i asked him for books and any help that he could give me with oka sayye. </s>
<s>  since i had mentioned you last night he told mother and louise about that, and they told me to bring you to the house some time. </s>
<s>  all of them are crazy to know you. </s>
<s>  mother says she is just wild to know whether a girl who wears boots and breeches and who knows canyons and the desert and the mountains as you do can be a feminine and lovable person. </s>
<s> " "if i told her how many friends i have, she could have speedily decided whether i am lovable or not," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but i would make an effort to convince her that i am strictly feminine. </s>
<s> " "you would convince her of that without making the slightest effort. </s>
<s>  you're infinitely more feminine than any other girl i have ever known " "how do you figure that?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  "well," said donald, "it's a queer thing about you, linda. </s>
<s>  i take any liberty i pretty nearly please with most of the girls i have been associated with. </s>
<s>  i tie their shoes and pull their hair--down if i want to--and hand them round 'most any way the notion takes me, and they just laugh and take the same liberties with me, which proves that i am pretty much a girl with them or they are pretty much boys with me. </s>
<s>  but it wouldn't occur to me to touch your hair or your shoe lace or the tips of your fingers. </s>
<s>  which proves that you're more feminine than any other girl i know, because if you were not i would be treating you more like another boy. </s>
<s>  i thought, the first day we were together, that you were like a boy, and i said so, and i thought it because you did not tease me and flirt with me, but since i have come to know you better, you're less like a boy than any other girl i ever have known. </s>
<s> " "don't get psychological, donald," said linda. </s>
<s>  "go on with the jap. </s>
<s>  i haven't got an answer yet to what i really want to know. </s>
<s>  have you made the least progress this week? can you beat him?" donald hesitated, studying over the answer. </s>
<s>  "beat him at that trig proposition the other day," he said. </s>
<s>  "got an open commendation before the class. </s>
<s>  there's not a professor in any of my classes who isn't 'hep' to what i am after by this time, and if i would cajole them a little they would naturally be on my side, especially if their attention were called to that incident of yesterday. </s>
<s>  but you said i have to beat him with my brains, by doing better work than he does. </s>
<s>  so about the biggest thing i can honestly tell you is that i have held my own. </s>
<s>  i have only been ahead of him once this week, but i haven't failed in anything that he has accomplished. </s>
<s>  i have been able to put some additional touches to some work that he has done for which he used to be marked a which means your one hundred. </s>
<s>  double a which means your plus i made in one instance. </s>
<s>  and you needn't think that oka sayye does not realize what i am up to as well as any of the rest of the class, and you needn't think that he is not going to give me a run for my brain. </s>
<s>  all i have got will be needed before we finish this term. </s>
<s> " "i see," said linda, slowly nodding her head. </s>
<s>  "i wish," said donald, "that we had started this thing two years ago, or better still, four. </s>
<s>  but of course you were not in the high school four years ago and there wasn't a girl in my class or among my friends who cared whether i beat the jap or not. </s>
<s>  they greatly preferred that i take them motoring or to a dance or a picture show or a beach party. </s>
<s>  you're the only one except mother and louise who ever inspired me to get down to business. </s>
<s> "  linda laid her palm on the top of the sand heap and pressed it flat. </s>
<s>  she looked at donald with laughing eyes. </s>
<s>  "symbolical," she announced. </s>
<s>  "that sand was the jap. </s>
<s> " she stretched her hand toward him. </s>
<s>  "that was you. </s>
<s>  did you see yourself squash him?" donald's laugh was grim. </s>
<s>  "yes, i saw," he said. </s>
<s>  "i wish it were as easy as that. </s>
<s> " "that was not easy," said linda. </s>
<s>  "make a mental computation of all the seconds that it took me to erect that pyramid and all the millions of grains of sand i had to gather. </s>
<s> " donald was deeply thoughtful, yet a half smile was playing round his lips. </s>
<s>  "of all the queer girls i ever knew, you're the cap sheaf, linda," he said. </s>
<s>  linda rose slowly, shook the sand from her breeches and stretched out her hand. </s>
<s>  "let's hotfoot it down to the african village and see what the movies are doing that is interesting today," she proposed. </s>
<s>  chapter xxi. </s>
<s>  shifting the responsibility on her pillow that night before dropping to almost instantaneous sleep linda reflected that if you could not ride the king's highway, racing the sands of santa monica was a very excellent substitute. </s>
<s>  it had been a wonderful day after all. </s>
<s>  when she had left donald at the lilac valley end of the car line he had held her hand tight an instant and looked into her face with the most engaging of clear, boyish smiles. </s>
<s>  "linda, isn't our friendship the nicest thing that ever happened to us?" he demanded. </s>
<s>  "yes," answered linda promptly, "quite the nicest. </s>
<s>  make your plans for all day long next saturday. </s>
<s> " "i'll be here before the birds are awake," promised donald. </s>
<s>  at the close of monday's sessions, going down the broad walk from the high school, donald overtook linda and in a breathless whisper he said: "what do you think? i came near oka sayye again this morning in trig, and his hair was as black as jet, dyed to a midnight, charcoal finish, and i am not right sure that he had not borrowed some girl's lipstick and rouge pot for the benefit of his lips and cheeks. </s>
<s>  positively he is hectically youthful today. </s>
<s>  what do you know about that?" then he hurried on to overtake the crowd of boys he had left, linda's heart was racing in her breast. </s>
<s>  turning, she re-entered the school building, and taking a telephone directory she hunted an address, and then, instead of going to the car line that took her to lilac valley she went to the address she had looked up. </s>
<s>  with a pencil she wrote a few lines on a bit of scratch paper in one of her books. </s>
<s>  that note opened a door and admitted her to the presence of a tall, lean, gray-haired man with quick, blue-gray eyes and lips that seemed capable of being either grave or gay on short notice. </s>
<s>  with that perfect ease which linda had acquired through the young days of her life in meeting friends of her father, she went to the table beside which this man was standing and stretched out her hand. </s>
<s>  "judge whiting?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "yes," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "i am linda strong, the younger daughter of alexander strong. </s>
<s>  i think you knew my father. </s>
<s> " "yes," said the judge, "i knew him very well indeed, and i have some small acquaintance with his daughter through very interesting reports that my son brings home. </s>
<s> " "yes, it is about donald that i came to see you," said linda. </s>
<s>  if she had been watching as her father would have watched, linda would have seen the slight uplift of the judge's figure, the tensing of his muscles, the narrowing of his eyes in the swift, speculative look he passed over her from the crown of her bare, roughened black head down the gold-brown of her dress to her slender, well-shod feet. </s>
<s>  the last part of that glance linda caught. </s>
<s>  she slightly lifted one of the feet under inspection, thrust it forward and looked at the judge with a gay challenge in her dark eyes. </s>
<s>  "are you interested in them too?" she asked. </s>
<s>  the judge was embarrassed. </s>
<s>  a flush crept into his cheeks. </s>
<s>  he was supposed to be master of any emergency that might arise, but one had arisen in connection with a slip of a schoolgirl that left him wordless. </s>
<s>  "it is very probable," said linda, "that if my shoes had been like most other girls' shoes i wouldn't be here today. </s>
<s>  i was in the same schoolroom with your son for three years, and he never saw me or spoke to me until one day he stopped me to inquire why i wore the kind of shoes i did. </s>
<s>  he said he had a battle to wage with me because i tried to be a law to myself, and he wanted to know why i wasn't like other girls. </s>
<s>  and i told him i had a crow to pick with him because he had the kind of brain that would be content to let a jap beat him in his own school, in his own language and in his own country. </s>
<s>  so we made an engagement to fight to a finish, and it ended by his becoming the only boy friend i have and the nicest boy friend a girl ever had, i am very sure. </s>
<s>  that's why i am here. </s>
<s> " linda lifted her eyes and judge whiting looked into them till he saw the same gold lights in their depths that peter morrison had seen. </s>
<s>  he came around the table and placed a big leather chair for linda. </s>
<s>  then he went back and resumed his own. </s>
<s>  "of course," said the judge in his most engaging manner. </s>
<s>  "i gather from what donald has told me that you have a reason for being here, and i want you to understand that i am intensely interested in anything you have to say to me. </s>
<s>  now tell me why you came. </s>
<s> " "i came," said linda, "because i started something and am afraid of the possible result. </s>
<s>  i think very likely if, in retaliation for what donald said to me about my hair and my shoes, i had not twitted him about the use he was making of his brain and done everything in my power to drive him into competition with oka sayye in the hope that a white man would graduate with the highest honors, he would not have gone into this competition, which i am now certain has antagonized oka sayye. </s>
<s> " linda folded her slim hands on the table and leaned forward. </s>
<s>  "judge whiting," she said earnestly, "i know very little about men. </s>
<s>  the most i know was what i learned about my father and the men with whom he occasionally hunted and fished. </s>
<s>  they were all such fine men that i must have grown up thinking that every man was very like them, but one day i came in direct contact with the jap that donald is trying to beat, and the thing i saw in his face put fear into my heart and it has been there ever since. </s>
<s>  i have almost an unreasoning fear of that jap, not because he has said anything or done anything. </s>
<s>  it's just instinctive. </s>
<s>  i may be wholly wrong in having come to you and in taking up your time, but there are two things i wanted to tell you. </s>
<s>  i could have told donald, but if i did and his mind went off at a tangent thinking of these things he wouldn't be nearly so likely to be in condition to give his best thought to his studies. </s>
<s>  if i really made him see what i think i have seen, and fear what i know i fear, he might fail where i would give almost anything to see him succeed. </s>
<s>  so i thought i would come to you and tell you about it and ask you please to think it over, and to take extra care of him, because i really believe that he may be in danger. </s>
<s>  and if he is i never shall be able to rid myself of a sense of responsibility. </s>
<s> " "i see," said judge whiting. </s>
<s>  "now tell me, just as explicitly as you have told me this, exactly what it is that you fear. </s>
<s> " "last saturday," said linda, "donald told me that while standing at the board beside oka sayye, demonstrating a theorem, he noticed that there were gray hairs above the jap's ears, and he bluntly asked him, before the professor and the class, how old he was. </s>
<s>  in telling me, he said he had the feeling that if the jap could have done so in that instant, he would have killed him. </s>
<s>  he said he was nineteen, but donald says from the matured lines of his body, from his hands and his face and his hair, he is certain that he is thirty or more, and he thinks it very probable that he may have graduated at home before he came here to get his english for nothing from our public schools. </s>
<s>  i never before had the fact called to my attention that this was being done, but donald told me that he had been in classes with matured men when he was less than ten years of age. </s>
<s>  that is not fair, judge whiting. </s>
<s>  it is not right. </s>
<s>  there should be an age specified above which people may not be allowed to attend public school. </s>
<s> " "i quite agree with you," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "that has been done in the grades, but there is nothing fair in bringing a boy under twenty in competition with a man graduated from the institutions of another country, even in the high schools. </s>
<s>  if this be the case--" "you can be certain that it is," said linda, "because donald whispered to me as he passed me half an hour ago, coming from the school building, that today oka sayye's hair is a uniform, shining black, and he also thought that he had used a lipstick and rouge in an effort at rejuvenation. </s>
<s>  do you think, from your knowledge of donald, that he would imagine that?" "no," said judge whiting, "i don't think such a thing would occur to him unless he saw it. </s>
<s> " "neither do i," said linda. </s>
<s>  "from the short acquaintance i have with him i should not call him at all imaginative, but he is extremely quick and wonderfully retentive. </s>
<s>  you have to show him but once from which cactus he can get victrola needles and fishing hooks, or where to find material for wooden legs. </s>
<s> " the judge laughed. </s>
<s>  "doesn't prove much," he said. </s>
<s>  "you wouldn't have to show me that more than once either. </s>
<s>  if anyone were giving me an intensive course on such interesting subjects, i would guarantee to remember, even at my age. </s>
<s> " linda nodded in acquiescence. </s>
<s>  "then you can regard it as quite certain," she said, "that oka sayye is making up in an effort to appear younger than he is which means that he doesn't want his right questioned to be in our schools, to absorb the things that we are taught, to learn our language, our government, our institutions, our ideals, our approximate strength and our only-too-apparent weakness. </s>
<s> " the judge leaned forward and waited attentively. </s>
<s>  "the other matter," said linda, "was relative to saturday. </s>
<s>  there may not be a thing in it, but sometimes a woman's intuition proves truer than what a man thinks he sees and knows. </s>
<s>  i haven't seen a thing, and i don't know a thing, but i don't believe your gardener was sick last week. </s>
<s>  i believe he had a dirty job he wanted done and preferred to save his position and avoid risks by getting some other jap who had no family and no interests here, to do it for him. </s>
<s>  i don't believe that your car, having run all right friday night, was shot to pieces saturday morning so that donald went smash with it in a manner that might very easily have killed him, or sent him to the hospital for months, while oka sayye carried off the honors without competition i want to ask you to find out whether your regular gardener truly was ill, whether he has a family and interests to protect here, or whether he is a man who could disappear in a night as japs who have leased land and have families cannot. </s>
<s>  i want to know about the man who took your gardener's place, and i want the man who is repairing your car interviewed very carefully as to what he found the trouble with it. </s>
<s> " linda paused. </s>
<s>  judge whiting sat in deep thought, then he looked at linda. </s>
<s>  "i see," he said at last. </s>
<s>  "thank you very much for coming to me. </s>
<s>  all these things and anything that develops from them shall be handled carefully. </s>
<s>  of course you know that donald is my only son and you can realize what he is to me and to his mother and sister. </s>
<s> " "it is because i do realize that," said linda, "that i am here. </s>
<s>  i appreciate his friendship, but it is not for my own interests that i am asking to have him taken care of while he wages his mental war with this jap. </s>
<s>  i want donald to have the victory, but i want it to be a victory that will be an inspiration to any boy of white blood among any of our allies or among peoples who should be our allies. </s>
<s>  there's a showdown coming between the white race and a mighty aggregation of colored peoples one of these days, and if the white man doesn't realize pretty soon that his supremacy is not only going to be contested but may be lost, it just simply will be lost. </s>
<s>  that is all there is to it. </s>
<s> " the judge was studying deeply now. </s>
<s>  finally he said: "young lady, i greatly appreciate your coming to me. </s>
<s>  there may be nothing in what you fear. </s>
<s>  it might be a matter of national importance. </s>
<s>  in any event, it shows that your heart is in the right place. </s>
<s>  may mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting and i pay you a visit some day soon in your home?" "of course," said linda simply. </s>
<s>  "i told donald to bring his mother the first time he came, but he said he did not need to be chaperoned when he came to see me, because my father's name was a guarantee to his mother that my home would be a proper place for him to visit. </s>
<s> " "i wonder how many of his other girl friends invited him to bring his mother to see them," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "oh, he probably grew up with the other girls and was acquainted with them from tiny things," said linda. </s>
<s>  "very likely," conceded the judge. </s>
<s>  "i think, after all, i would rather have an invitation to make one of those trips with you to the desert or the mountains. </s>
<s>  is there anything else as interesting as fish hooks and victrola needles and wooden legs to be learned?" "oh, yes," said linda, leaning farther forward, a lovely color sweeping up into her cheeks, her eyes a-shine. </s>
<s>  she had missed the fact that the judge was jesting. </s>
<s>  she had thought him in sober, scientific earnest. </s>
<s>  "it's an awfully nice thing if you dig a plant or soil your hands in hunting, or anything like that, to know that there are four or five different kinds of vegetable soap where you can easily reach them, if you know them. </s>
<s>  if you lose your way or have a long tramp, it's good to know which plants will give you drink and where they are. </s>
<s>  and if you're short of implements, you might at any time need a mescal stick, or an arrow shaft or an arrow, even. </s>
<s>  if donald were lost now, he could keep alive for days, because he would know what wood would make him a bow and how he could take amole fiber and braid a bow string and where he could make arrows and arrow points so that he could shoot game for food. </s>
<s>  i have taught him to make a number of snares, and he knows where to find and how to cook his greens and potatoes and onions and where to find his pickles and how to make lemonade and tea, and what to use for snake bite. </s>
<s>  it's been such fun, judge whiting, and he has been so interested. </s>
<s> " "yes, i should think he would be," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "i am interested myself. </s>
<s>  if you would take an old boy like me on a few of those trips, i would be immensely pleased. </s>
<s> " "you'd like brigand beefsteak," suggested linda, "and you'd like cress salad, and i am sure you'd like creamed yucca. </s>
<s> " "hm," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "sounds to me like jane meredith. </s>
<s> " linda suddenly sat straight. </s>
<s>  a dazed expression crossed her face. </s>
<s>  presently she recovered. </s>
<s>   "will you kindly tell me," she said, "what a great criminal judge knows about jane meredith?" "why, i hear my wife and daughter talking about her," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "i wonder," said linda, "if a judge hears so many secrets that he forgets what a secret is and couldn't possibly keep one to save his life. </s>
<s> " "on the other h" said judge whiting, "a judge hears so many secrets that he learns to be a very secretive person himself, and if a young lady just your size and so like you in every way as to be you, told me anything and told me that it was a secret, i would guarantee to carry it with me to my grave, if i said i would. </s>
<s> " one of linda's special laughs floated out of the windows. </s>
<s>  her right hand slipped across the table toward the judge. </s>
<s>  "cross your heart and body?" she challenged. </s>
<s>  the judge took the hand she offered in both of his own. </s>
<s>  "on my soul," he said, "i swear it. </s>
<s> " "all right," bubbled linda. </s>
<s>  "judge whiting, allow me to present to you jane meredith, the author and originator of the aboriginal cookery articles now running in everybody's home. </s>
<s> ', linda stood up as she made the presentation and the judge arose with her. </s>
<s>  when she bowed her dark head before him the judge bowed equally as low, then he took the hand he held and pressed it against his lips. </s>
<s>  "i am not surprised," he said. </s>
<s>  "i am honored, deeply honored, and i am delighted. </s>
<s>  for a high school girl that is a splendid achievement. </s>
<s> " "but you realize, of course," said linda, "that it is vicarious. </s>
<s>  i really haven't done anything. </s>
<s>  i am just passing on to the world what alexander strong found it interesting to teach his daughter, because he hadn't a son. </s>
<s> " "i certainly am fortunate that my son is getting the benefit of this," said judge whiting earnestly. </s>
<s>  "there are girls who make my old-fashioned soul shudder, but i shall rest in great comfort whenever i know that my boy is with you. </s>
<s> " "sure!" laughed linda. </s>
<s>  "i am not vamping him. </s>
<s>  i don't know the first principles. </s>
<s>  we're not doing a thing worse than sucking 'hunters' rock leek' or roasting indian potatoes or fishing for trout with cactus spines. </s>
<s>  i have had such a lovely time i don't believe that i'll apologize for coming. </s>
<s>  but you won't waste a minute in making sure about oka sayye?" "i won't waste a minute," said the judge. </s>
<s>  chapter xxii. </s>
<s>  the end of marian's contest coming from school a few days later on an evening when she had been detained, linda found a radiant katy awaiting her. </s>
<s>  "what's up, old dear?" cried linda. </s>
<s>  "you seem positively illumined. </s>
<s> " "so be," said katy. </s>
<s>  "it's a good time i am havin'. </s>
<s>  in the first place the previous boss of this place ain't nowise so bossy as sue used to be, an' livin' with her is a dale aisier. </s>
<s>  an' then, when miss eileen is around these days, she is beginning to see things, and she is just black with jealousy of ye. </s>
<s>  something funny happened here the afternoon, an' she was home for once an' got the full benefit of it. </s>
<s>  i was swapin' the aist walk, but i know she was inside the window an' i know she heard. </s>
<s>  first, comes a great big loaded automobile drivin' up, and stopped in front with a flourish an' out hops as nice an' nate a lookin' lad as ever you clapped your eyes on, an' up he comes to me an' off goes his hat with a swape, an' he hands me that bundle an' he says: 'here's something miss linda is wantin' bad for her wild garden. </s>
<s> ' " katy handed linda a bundle of newspaper, inside which, wrapped in a man's handkerchief, she found several plants, carefully lifted, the roots properly balled, the heads erect, crisp, although in full flower. </s>
<s>  "oh, katy!" cried linda. </s>
<s>  "look, it's gallito, 'little rooster'!" "now ain't them jist yellow violets?" asked katy dubiously. </s>
<s>  "no," said linda, "they are not. </s>
<s>  they are quite a bit rarer. </s>
<s>  they are really a wild pansy. </s>
<s>  bring water, katy, and help me. </s>
<s> " "but i have something else for ye," said katy. </s>
<s>  "i don't care what you have," answered linda. </s>
<s>  "i am just compelled to park these little roosters at once. </s>
<s> " "what makes ye call them that ungodly name?" asked katy. </s>
<s>  "nothing ungodly about it," answered linda. </s>
<s>  "it's funny. </s>
<s>  gallito is the spanish name for these violets, and it means 'little rooster. </s>
<s> ' " linda set the violets as carefully as they had been lifted and rinsed her hands at the hydrant. </s>
<s>  "now bring on the remainder of the exhibit," she ordered. </s>
<s>  "it's there on the top of the rock pile, which you notice has incrased since ye last saw it. </s>
<s> " "so it has!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "so it has! and beautifully colored specimens those are too. </s>
<s>  my fern bed will lift up its voice and rejoice in them. </s>
<s>  and rocks mean henry anderson. </s>
<s>  the box i do not understand. </s>
<s> " linda picked it up, untied the string, and slipped off the wrapping. </s>
<s>  katy stared in wide-mouthed amazement. </s>
<s>  "i was just tickled over that because miss eileen saw a good- looking and capable young man leave a second package, right on the heels of young whiting," she said. </s>
<s>  "whatever have ye got, lambie? what does that mean?" linda held up a beautiful box of glass, inside of which could be seen swarming specimens of every bug, beetle, insect, and worm that henry anderson had been able to collect in heaven only knew what hours of search. </s>
<s>  linda opened the box. </s>
<s>  the winged creatures flew, the bettles tumbled, the worms went over the top. </s>
<s>  she set it on the ground and laughed to exhaustion. </s>
<s>  her eyes were wet as she looked up at katy. </s>
<s>  "that first night henry anderson and peter morrison were here to dinner, katy," she said, "anderson made a joke about being my bug-catcher when i built my home nest, and several times since he has tried to be silly about it, but the last time i told him it was foolishness to which i would listen no more, so instead of talking, he has taken this way of telling me that he is fairly expert as a bug-catcher. </s>
<s>  really, it is awfully funny, katy. </s>
<s> " katy was sober. </s>
<s>  she showed no appreciation of the fun. </s>
<s>  "ye know, lambie," she said, her hands on her hips, her elbows wide-spread, her jaws argumentative, "i have done some blarneying with that lad, an' i have fed him some, because he was doin' things that would help an' please ye, but now i am tellin' ye, just like i'll be tellin' ye till i die, i ain't strong for him. </s>
<s>  if ever the day comes when ye ask me to take on that whiting kid for me boss, i'll bow my head an' i'll fly at his bidding, because he is real, he is goin' to come out a man lots like your pa, or hisn. </s>
<s>  an' if ever the day comes when ye will be telling me ye want me to serve pater morrison, i'll well nigh get on my knees to him. </s>
<s>  i think he would be the closest we'd ever come to gettin' the master back. </s>
<s>  but i couldn't say i would ever take to anderson. </s>
<s>  they's something about him, i can't just say what, but he puts me back up amazin'. </s>
<s> " "don't worry, ancient custodian of the family," said linda. </s>
<s>  "that same something in henry anderson that antagonizes you, affects me in even stronger degree. </s>
<s>  you must not get the foolish notion that any man has a speculative eye on me, because it is not true. </s>
<s>  donald whiting is only a boy friend, treating me as a brother would, and peter morrison is much too sophisticated and mature to pay any serious attention to a girl with a year more high school before her. </s>
<s>  i want to be decent to henry anderson, because he is peter's architect, and i am deeply interested in peter's house and the lady who will live in it. </s>
<s>  sometimes i hope it will be donald's sister, mary louise. </s>
<s>  anyway, i am going to get acquainted with her and make it my business to see that she and peter get their chance to know each other well. </s>
<s>  my job for peter is to help run his brook at the proper angle, build his bridge, engineer his road, and plant his grounds. </s>
<s>  so don't be dreaming any foolish dreams, katy. </s>
<s> " katy folded her arms, tilted her chin at an unusually aspiring angle, and deliberately sniffed. </s>
<s>  "don't ye be lettin' yourself belave your own foolishness," she said. </s>
<s>  "i ain't done with me exhibit yet. </s>
<s>  on the hall table ye will find a package from the pater morrison man that miss eileen had the joy of takin' in and layin' aside for ye, an atop of it rists a big letter that i am thinkin' might mean miss marian. </s>
<s> " "oh," cried linda. </s>
<s>  "why are you wasting all this time? if there is a letter from marian it may mean that the competition is decided. </s>
<s>  but if it is, she loses, because she was to telegraph if she won. </s>
<s> " linda rushed into the house and carried her belongings to her workroom. </s>
<s>  she dropped them on the table and looked at them. </s>
<s>  "i'll get you off my mind first," she said to the morrison package, which enclosed a new article entitled "how to grow good citizens. </s>
<s> " with it was a scrawled line, "i am leaving the head and heels of the future to you. </s>
<s> " "how fine!" exulted linda. </s>
<s>  "he must have liked the head and tail pieces i drew for his other article, so he wants the same for this, and if he is well paid for his article, maybe in time, after i have settled for my hearth motto, he will pay me something for my work. </s>
<s>  gal-lum-shus!" as she opened the letter from marian she slowly shook her head. </s>
<s>  "drat the luck," she muttered, "no good news here. </s>
<s> " slowly and absorbedly she read: dearest linda: no telegram to send. </s>
<s>  i grazed the first prize and missed the second because henry anderson wins with plans so like mine that they are practically duplicates. </s>
<s>  i have not seen the winning plans. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  snow told me as gently as he could that the judges had ruled me out entirely. </s>
<s>  the winning plans are practically a reversal of mine, more professionally drawn, and no doubt the specifications are far ahead of mine, as these are my weak spot, although i have worked all day and far into the night on the mathematics of house building. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  snow was very kind, and terribly cut up about it. </s>
<s>  i made what i hope was a brave fight, i did so believe in those plans that i am afraid to say just how greatly disappointed i am. </s>
<s>  all i can do is to go to work again and try to find out how to better my best, which i surely put into the plans i submitted. </s>
<s>  i can't see how henry anderson came to hit upon some of my personal designs for comforts and conveniences. </s>
<s>  i had hoped that no man would think of my especial kitchen plans. </s>
<s>  i rather fancied myself as a benefactor to my sex, an emancipator from drudgery, as it were. </s>
<s>  i had a concealed feeling that it required a woman who had expended her strength combating the construction of a devilish kitchen, to devise some of my built-in conveniences, and i worked as carefully on my kitchen table, as on any part of the house. </s>
<s>  if i find later that the winning plans include these things i shall believe that henry anderson is a mind reader, or that lost plans naturally gravitate to him. </s>
<s>  but there is no use to grouch further. </s>
<s>  i seem to be born a loser. </s>
<s>  anyway, i haven't lost you and i still have dana meade. </s>
<s>  i have nothing else to tell you except that mr. </s>
<s>  snow has waited for me two evenings out of the week ever since i wrote you, and he has taken me in his car and simply forced me to drive him for an hour over what appeals to me to be the most difficult roads he could select. </s>
<s>  so far i have not balked at anything but he has had the consideration not to direct me to the mountains. </s>
<s>  he is extremely attractive, linda, and i do enjoy being with him, but i dread it too, because his grief is so deep and so apparent that it constantly keeps before me the loss of my own dear ones, and those things to which the hymn books refer as "aching voids" in my own life. </s>
<s>  but there is something you will be glad to hear. </s>
<s>  that unknown correspondent of mine is still sending letters, and i am crazy about them. </s>
<s>  i don't answer one now until i have mulled over it two or three days and i try to give him as good as he sends. </s>
<s>  i judge from your letters that you are keeping at least even with eileen, and that life is much happier for you. </s>
<s>  you seem to be broadening. </s>
<s>  i am so glad for the friendship you have formed with donald whiting. </s>
<s>  my mother and mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting were friends. </s>
<s>  she is a charming woman and it has seemed to me that in her daughter louise she has managed a happy compound of old-fashioned straightforwardness and unswerving principle, festooned with happy trimmings of all that is best in the present days. </s>
<s>  i hope that you do become acquainted with her. </s>
<s>  she is older than you, but she is the kind of girl i know you would like. </s>
<s>  don't worry because i have lost again, linda dear. </s>
<s>  today is my blue day. </s>
<s>  tomorrow i shall roll up my sleeves and go at it again with all my might, and by and by it is written in the books that things will come right for me. </s>
<s>  they cannot go wrong for ever. </s>
<s>  with dearest love, marian. </s>
<s>  linda looked grim as she finished the letter. </s>
<s>  "confound such luck," she said emphatically. </s>
<s>  "i do not understand it. </s>
<s>  how can a man like henry anderson know more about comforts and conveniences in a home than a woman with marian's experience and comprehension? and she has been gaining experience for the past ten years. </s>
<s>  that partner of his must be a six-cylinder miracle. </s>
<s> " linda went to the kitchen, because she was in pressing need of someone to whom to tell her troubles, and there was no one except katy. </s>
<s>  what katy said was energetic and emphatic, but it comforted linda, because she agreed with it and what she was seeking at the minute was someone who agreed with her. </s>
<s>  as she went back upstairs, she met eileen on her way to the front door. </s>
<s>  eileen paused and deliberately studied linda's face, and linda stopped and waited quietly until she chose to speak. </s>
<s>  "i presume," said eileen at last, "that you and katy would call the process through which you are going right now, 'taking the bit in your teeth,' or some poetic thing like that, but i can't see that you are getting much out of it. </s>
<s>  i don't hear the old laugh or the clatter of gay feet as i did before all this war of dissatisfaction broke out. </s>
<s>  this minute if you haven't either cried, or wanted to, i miss my guess. </s>
<s> " "you win," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i have not cried, because i make it a rule never to resort to tears when i can help it. </s>
<s>  so what you see now is unshed tears in my heart. </s>
<s>  they in no way relate to what you so aptly term my 'war of dissatisfaction'. </s>
<s>  they are for marian. </s>
<s>  she has lost again, this time the nicholson and snow prize in architecture. </s>
<s> " "serves her right," said eileen, laughing contemptuously. </s>
<s>  "the ridiculous idea of her trying to compete in a man's age-old occupation! as if she ever could learn enough about joists and beams and girders and installing water and gas and electricity to build a house. </s>
<s>  she should have had the sense to know she couldn't do it. </s>
<s> " "" said linda quietly, "marian wasn't proposing to be a contractor, she only wants to be an architect. </s>
<s>  and the man who beat her is peter morrison's architect, henry anderson, and he won by such a narrow margin that her plans were thrown out of second and third place, because they were so very similar to his. </s>
<s>  doesn't that strike you as curious?" "that is more than curious," said eileen slowly. </s>
<s>  "that is a very strange coincidence. </s>
<s>  they couldn't have had anything from each other, because they only met at dinner, before all of us, and marian went away the next morning. </s>
<s>  it does seem queer. </s>
<s> " then she added with a flash of generosity and justice, "it looks pretty good for marian, at that. </s>
<s>  if she came so near winning that she lost second and third because she was too near first to make any practical difference, i must be wrong and she must be right. </s>
<s> " "you are wrong," said linda tersely, "if you think marian cannot make wonderful plans for houses. </s>
<s>  but going back to what my 'war of dissatisfaction' is doing to me, it's a pale affair compared with what it is doing to you, eileen. </s>
<s>  you look a debilitated silhouette of the near recent past. </s>
<s>  do you feel that badly about giving up a little money and authority?" "i never professed to have the slightest authority over you," said eileen very primly, as she drew back in the shadows. </s>
<s>  "you have come and gone exactly as you pleased. </s>
<s>  all i ever tried to do was to keep up a decent appearance before the neighbors and make financial ends meet. </s>
<s> " "that never seemed to wear on you as something seems to do now," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i am thankful that this week ends it. </s>
<s>  i was looking for you because i wanted to tell you to be sure not to make any date that will keep you from meeting me at the office of the president of the consolidated bank thursday afternoon. </s>
<s>  i am going to arrange with john to be there and it shouldn't take fifteen minutes to run through matters and divide the income in a fair way between us. </s>
<s>  i am willing for you to go on paying the bills and ordering for the house as you have been. </s>
<s> " "certainly you are," sneered eileen. </s>
<s>  "you are quite willing for all the work and use the greater part of my time to make you comfortable. </s>
<s> " linda suddenly drew back. </s>
<s>  her body seemed to recoil, but her head thrust forward as if to bring her eyes in better range to read eileen's face. </s>
<s>  "that is utterly unjust, eileen," she cried. </s>
<s>  then two at a time she rushed the stairs in a race for her room. </s>
<s>  chapter xxiii. </s>
<s>  the day of jubilee linda started to school half an hour earlier wednesday morning because that was the day for her weekly trip to the post office for any mail which might have come to her under the name of jane meredith. </s>
<s>  she had hard work to keep down her color when she recognized the heavy gray envelope used by the editor of everybody's home. </s>
<s>  as she turned from the window with it in her fingers she was trembling slightly and wondering whether she could have a minute's seclusion to face the answer which her last letter might have brought. </s>
<s>  there was a small alcove beside a public desk at one side of the room. </s>
<s>  linda stepped into this, tore open the envelope and slipped out the sheet it contained. </s>
<s>  dazedly she stared at the slip that fell from it. </s>
<s>  slowly the color left her cheeks and then came rushing back from her surcharged heart until her very ears were red, because that slip was very manifestly a cheque for five hundred dollars. </s>
<s>  mentally and physically linda shook herself, then she straightened to full height, tensing her muscles and holding the sheet before her with a hand on each side to keep it from shaking, while she read: my dear madam: i sincerely apologize for having waited so long before writing you of the very exceptional reception which your articles have had. </s>
<s>  i think one half their attraction has been the exquisite and appealing pictures you have sent for their illustration. </s>
<s>  at the present minute they are forming what i consider the most unique feature in the magazine. </s>
<s>  i am enclosing you a cheque for five hundred dollars as an initial payment on the series. </s>
<s>  just what the completed series should be worth i am unable to say until you inform me how many months you can keep it up at the same grade of culinary and literary interest and attractive illustration. </s>
<s>  but i should say at a rough estimate that you would be safe in counting upon a repetition of this cheque for every three articles you send in. </s>
<s>  this of course includes payment for the pictures also, which are to me if anything more attractive than the recipes, since the local color and environment they add to the recipe and the word sketch are valuable in the extreme. </s>
<s>  if you feel that you can continue this to the extent of even a small volume, i shall be delighted to send you a book contract. </s>
<s>  in considering this proposition, let me say that if you could not produce enough recipes to fill a book, you could piece it out to the necessary length most charmingly and attractively by lengthening the descriptions of the environment in which the particular fruits and vegetables you deal with are to be found. </s>
<s>  and in book form you might allow yourself much greater latitude in the instructions concerning the handling of the fruits and the preparation of the recipes. </s>
<s>  i think myself that a wonderfully attractive book could be made from this material, and hope that you will agree with me. </s>
<s>  trusting that this will be satisfactory to you and that you will seriously consider the book proposition before you decline it, i remain, my dear madam, very truly yours, hugh thompson, editor, everybody's home. </s>
<s>  gripping the cheque and the letter, linda lurched forward against the window casement and shut her eyes tight, because she could feel big, nervous gulps of exultation and rejoicing swelling up in her throat. </s>
<s>  she shifted the papers to one hand and surreptitiously slipped the other to her pocket. </s>
<s>  she tried to keep the papers before her and looked straight from the window to avoid attracting attention. </s>
<s>  the tumult of exultation in her heart was so wild that she did not surely know whether she wanted to sink to the floor, lay her face against the glass, and indulge in what for generations women have referred to as "a good cry," or whether she wanted to leap from the window and sport on the wind like a driven leaf. </s>
<s>  then she returned the letter and cheque to the envelope, and slipped it inside her blouse, and started on her way to school. </s>
<s>  she might as well have gone to multiflores canyon and pitted her strength against climbing its walls for the day, for all the good she did in her school work. </s>
<s>  she heard no word of any recitation by her schoolmates. </s>
<s>  she had no word ready when called on for a recitation herself. </s>
<s>  she heard nothing that was said by any of the professors. </s>
<s>  on winged feet she was flying back and forth from the desert to the mountains, from the canyons to the sea. </s>
<s>  she was raiding beds of amass and devising ways to roast the bulbs and make a new dish. </s>
<s>  she was compounding drinks from mescal and bisnaga. </s>
<s>  she was hunting desert pickles and trying to remember whether indian rhubarb ever grew so far south. </s>
<s>  she was glad when the dismissal hour came that afternoon. </s>
<s>  with eager feet she went straight to the consolidated bank and there she asked again to be admitted to the office of the president. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  worthington rose as she came in. </s>
<s>  "am i wrong in my dates?" he inquired. </s>
<s>  "i was not expecting you until tomorrow. </s>
<s> " "no, you're quite right," said linda. </s>
<s>  "at this hour tomorrow. </s>
<s>   mr. </s>
<s>  worthington, i am in trouble again. </s>
<s> " linda looked so distressed that the banker pushed a chair to the table's side for her, and when she had seated herself, he said quietly: "tell me all about it, linda. </s>
<s>  we must get life straightened out as best we can. </s>
<s> " "i think i must tell you all about it," said linda, "because i know just enough about banking to know that i have a proposition that i don't know how to handle. </s>
<s>  are bankers like father confessors and doctors and lawyers?" "i think they are even more so," laughed mr. </s>
<s>  worthington. </s>
<s>  "perhaps the father confessor takes precedence, otherwise i believe people are quite as much interested in their financial secrets as in anything else in all this world. </s>
<s>  have you a financial secret?" "yes," said linda, "i have what is to me a big secret, and i don't in the least know how to handle it, so right away i thought about you and that you would be the one to tell me what i could do. </s>
<s> " "go ahead," said mr. </s>
<s>  worthington kindly. </s>
<s>  "i'll give you my word of honor to keep any secret you confide to me. </s>
<s> " linda produced her letter. </s>
<s>  she opened it and without any preliminaries handed it and the cheque to the banker. </s>
<s>  he looked at the cheque speculatively, and then laid it aside and read the letter. </s>
<s>  he gave every evidence of having read parts of it two or three times, then he examined the cheque again, and glanced at linda. </s>
<s>  "and just how did you come into possession of this, young lady?" he inquired. </s>
<s>  "and what is it that you want of me?" "why, don't you see?" said linda. </s>
<s>  "it's my letter and my cheque. </s>
<s>  i am 'jane meredith. </s>
<s> ' now how am i going to get my money. </s>
<s>  for one dazed moment mr. </s>
<s>  worthington studied linda. </s>
<s>  then he threw back his head and laughed unrestrainedly. </s>
<s>  he came around the table and took both linda's hands. </s>
<s>  "bully for you !" he cried exultantly. </s>
<s>  "how i wish your father could see the seed he has sown bearing its fruit. </s>
<s>  isn't that fine? and do you want to go on with this anonymously?" "i think i must," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i have said in my heart that no jap, male or female, young or old, shall take first honors in a class from which i graduate. </s>
<s>  and you can see that if people generally knew this, it would make it awfully hard for me to go on with my studies, and i don't know that the editor who is accepting this work would take it if he knew it were sent him by a high-school junior. </s>
<s>  you see the dignified way in which he ad dresses me as 'madam'?" "i see," said mr. </s>
<s>  worthington reflectively. </s>
<s>  "i am sure," said linda with demure lips, though the eyes above them were blazing and dancing at high tension, "i am sure that the editor is attaching a husb and a house having a well-ordered kitchen, and rather wide culinary experience to that 'dear madam. </s>
<s> '" "and what about this book proposition?" asked the banker gravely. </s>
<s>  "that would be a big thing for a girl of your age. </s>
<s>  can you do it, and continue your school work?" "with the background i have, with the unused material i have, and with vacation coming before long, i can do it easily," said linda. </s>
<s>  "my school work is not difficult for me. </s>
<s>  it only requires concentration for about two hours in the preparation that each day brings. </s>
<s>  the remainder of the time i could give to amplifying and producing new recipes. </s>
<s> " "i see," said the banker. </s>
<s>  "so you have resolved, linda, that you don't want your editor to know your real name. </s>
<s> " "could scarcely be done," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but have you stopped to think," said the banker, "that you will be asked for personal history and about your residence, and no doubt a photograph of yourself. </s>
<s>  if you continue this work anonymously you're going to have trouble with more matters than cashing a cheque. </s>
<s> " "but i am not going to have any trouble cashing a cheque," she said, "because i have come straight to the man whose business is cheques. </s>
<s> " "true enough," he said. </s>
<s>  "i shall have to arrange the cheque. </s>
<s>  there's not a doubt about that. </s>
<s>  and as for your other bugbears " "i refuse to be frightened by them," interposed linda. </s>
<s>  "have you ever done any business at the bank?" "no," said linda. </s>
<s>  "none of the clerks know you?" "not that i remember," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i might possibly be acquainted with some of them. </s>
<s>  i have merely passed through the bank on my way to your room twice. </s>
<s> " "then," said the banker, "we'll have to risk it. </s>
<s>  after this estate business is settled you will want to open an account in your name. </s>
<s> " "quite true," said linda. </s>
<s>  "then i would advise you," said mr. </s>
<s>  worthington, "to open this account in your own name. </s>
<s>  endorse this cheque 'jane meredith' and make it payable to me personally. </s>
<s>  whenever one of these comes, bring it to me and i'll take care of it for you. </s>
<s>  one minute. </s>
<s> " he left linda sitting quietly reading and rereading her letter, and presently returned and laid a sheaf of paper money before her. </s>
<s>  "take it to the paying teller. </s>
<s>  tell him that you wish to deposit it, and ask him to give you a bank book and a cheque book," he said. </s>
<s>  "thank you very much for coming to me and for confiding in me. </s>
<s> " linda gathered up the money, and said good-bye to the banker. </s>
<s>  just as she started forward she recognized eileen at the window of the paying teller. </s>
<s>  it was an eileen she never before had seen. </s>
<s>  her face was strained to a ghastly gray. </s>
<s>  her hat was not straight and her hands were shaking. </s>
<s>  without realizing that she was doing it, linda stepped behind one of the huge marble pillars supporting the ceiling and stood there breathlessly, watching eileen. </s>
<s>  she could gather that she was discussing the bank ledger which lay before the teller and that he was refusing something that eileen was imploring him to do. </s>
<s>  linda thought she understood what it was. </s>
<s>  then very clearly eileen's voice, sharp and strained, reached her ears. </s>
<s>  "you mean that you are refusing to pay me my deposits on my private account?" she cried. </s>
<s>  and linda could also hear the response. </s>
<s>  "i am very sorry if it annoys or inconveniences you, miss strong, but since the settlement of the estate takes place to morrow, our orders are to pay out no funds in any way connected with the estate until after that settlement has been arranged. </s>
<s> " "but this is my money, my own private affair," begged eileen. </s>
<s>  "the estate has nothing to do with it. </s>
<s> " "i am sorry," repeated the teller. </s>
<s>  "if that is the case, you will have no difficulty in establishing the fact in a few minutes' time. </s>
<s> " eileen turned and left the bank, and it seemed that she was almost swaying. </s>
<s>  linda stood a second with narrowed eyes, in deep thought. </s>
<s>  "i think," she said at last, deep down in her heart, "that it looks precious much as if there had been a bit of transgression in this affair. </s>
<s>  it looks, too, as if 'the way of the transgressor' were a darned hard way. </s>
<s>  straight ahead open and aboveboard for you, my girl!" then she went quietly to the desk and transacted her own business. </s>
<s>  but her beautiful day was clouded. </s>
<s>  her heart was no longer leaping exultantly. </s>
<s>  she was sickened and sorrowful over the evident nerve strain and discomfort which eileen seemed to have brought upon herself. </s>
<s>  she dreaded meeting her at dinner that night, and she wondered all the way home where eileen had gone from the bank and what she had been doing. </s>
<s>  what she felt was a pale affair compared with what she would have felt if she could have seen eileen leave the bank and enter a near-by store, go to a telephone booth and put in a long-distance call for san francisco. </s>
<s>  her eyes were brilliant, her cheeks by nature redder than the rouge she had used upon them. </s>
<s>  she squared her shoulders, lifted her head, as if she irrevocably had made a decision and would not be thwarted in acting upon it. </s>
<s>  while she waited she straightened her hat, and tucked up her pretty hair, once more evincing concern about her appearance. </s>
<s>  after a nervous wait she secured her party. </s>
<s>  "am i speaking with mr. </s>
<s>  james heitman?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "yes," came the answer. </s>
<s>  "well, uncle jim, this is eileen. </s>
<s> " "why, hello, girlie," was the quick response. </s>
<s>  "delighted that you're calling your ancient uncle. </s>
<s>  haven't changed the decision in the last letter i had from you, have you?" "yes," said eileen, "i have changed it. </s>
<s>  do you and aunt caroline still want me, uncle jim?" "you bet we want you!" roared the voice over the 'phone. </s>
<s>  "here we are, with plenty of money and not a relation on earth but you to leave it to. </s>
<s>  you belong to us by rights. </s>
<s>  we'd be tickled to death to have you, and for you to have what's left of the money when we get through with it. </s>
<s>  may i come after you? say the word, and i'll start this minute. </s>
<s> " "oh, uncle jim, could you? would you?" cried eileen. </s>
<s>  "well, i would say i could. </s>
<s>  we'd be tickled to death, i tell you!" "how long would it take you to get here?" said eileen. </s>
<s>  "well, i could reach you by noon tomorrow. </s>
<s>  eleven something is the shortest time it's been made in. </s>
<s>  that would give me thirteen --more than enough. </s>
<s>  are you in that much of a hurry?" "yes," gasped eileen, "yes, i am in the biggest kind of a hurry there is, uncle jim. </s>
<s>  this troublesome little estate has to be settled tomorrow afternoon. </s>
<s>  there's going to be complaint about everything that i have seen fit to do. </s>
<s>  i have been hounded and harassed till i am disgusted with it. </s>
<s>  then i have promised to marry john gilman as i wrote you, and i don't believe you would think that was my best chance with the opportunities you could give me. </s>
<s>  it seems foolish to stay here, abused as i have been lately, and as i will be tomorrow. </s>
<s>  you have the house number. </s>
<s>  if you come and get me out of it by noon tomorrow, i'll go with you. </s>
<s>  you may take out those adoption papers you have always entreated me to agree to and i'll be a daughter that you can be proud of. </s>
<s>  it will be a relief to have some real money and some real position, and to breathe freely and be myself once more. </s>
<s> " "all right for you, girlie!" bellowed the great voice over the line. </s>
<s>  "pick up any little personal bits you can put in a suitcase, and by twelve o'clock tomorrow i'll whisk you right out of that damn mess. </s>
<s> " eileen walked from the telephone booth with her head high, triumph written all over her face and figure. </s>
<s>  they were going to humiliate her. </s>
<s>  she would show them! she went home immediately. </s>
<s>  entering her room, she closed the door and stood looking at her possessions. </s>
<s>  how could she get her trunk from the garret? how could she get it to the station? would it be possible for uncle james to take it in his car? as she pondered these things eileen had a dim memory of a day in her childhood when her mother had gone on business to san francisco and had taken her along. </s>
<s>  she remembered a huge house, all turrets and towers and gables, all turns and twists and angles, closed to the light of day and glowing inside with shining artificial lights. </s>
<s>  she remembered stumbling over deep rugs. </s>
<s>  one vivid impression was of walls covered with huge canvases, some of them having frames more than a foot wide. </s>
<s>  she remembered knights in armor, and big fireplaces, and huge urns and vases. </s>
<s>  it seemed to her like the most wonderful bazaar she ever had been in. </s>
<s>  she remembered, too, that she had been glad when her mother had taken her out into the sunshine again and from the presence of two ponderous people who had objected strongly to everything her mother had discussed with them. </s>
<s>  she paused one instant, contemplating this picture. </s>
<s>  the look of triumph on her face toned down considerably. </s>
<s>  then she comforted herself aloud. </s>
<s>  "i have heard mother say," she said softly, "that everybody overdid things and did not know how to be graceful with immense fortunes got from silver and gold mines, and lumber. </s>
<s>  it will be different now. </s>
<s>  probably they don't live in the same house, even. </s>
<s>  there is a small army of servants, and there is nothing i can think of that uncle jim won't gladly get me. </s>
<s>  i have been too big a fool for words to live this way as long as i have. </s>
<s>  crush me, will they? i'll show them! i won't even touch these things i have strained so to get. </s>
<s> " eileen jerked from her throat the strand of pearls that she had worn continuously for four years and threw it contemptuously on her dressing table. </s>
<s>  "i'll make uncle jim get me a rope with two or three strands in it that will reach to my waist. </s>
<s>  'a suitcase !' i don't know what i would fill a suitcase with from here. </s>
<s>  the trunk may stay in the garret, and while i am leaving all this rubbish, i'll just leave john gilman with it. </s>
<s>  uncle jim will give me an income that will buy all the cigarettes i want without having to deceive anyone. </s>
<s>  and i can have money if i want to stake something at bridge without being scared into paralysis for fear somebody may find it out or the accounts won't balance. </s>
<s>  i'll put on the most suitable thing i have to travel in, and just walk out and leave everything else. </s>
<s> " that was what eileen did. </s>
<s>  at noon the next day her eyes were bright with nervousness. </s>
<s>  her cheeks alternately paled with fear and flooded red with anxiety. </s>
<s>  she had dressed herself carefully, laid out her hat and gloves and a heavy coat in case the night should be chilly. </s>
<s>  once she stood looking at the dainty, brightly colored dresses hanging in her wardrobe a flash of regret passed over her face. </s>
<s>  "tawdry little cheap things and makeshifts," she said. </s>
<s>  "if linda feels that she has been so terribly defrauded, she can help herself now!" by twelve o'clock she found herself standing at the window, straining her eyes down lilac valley. </s>
<s>  she was not looking at its helpful hills, at its appealing curves, at its brilliant colors. </s>
<s>  she was watching the roadway. </s>
<s>  when katy rang to call her to lunch, she told her to put the things away. </s>
<s>  she was expecting people who would take her out to lunch presently. </s>
<s>  in the past years she had occasionally written to her uncle. </s>
<s>  several times when he had had business in los angeles she had met him at his hotel and dined with him. </s>
<s>  she reasoned that he would come straight to the house and get her, and then they would go to one of the big hotels for lunch before they started. </s>
<s>  "i shan't feel like myself," said eileen, "until we are well on the way to san francisco. </s>
<s> " at one o'clock she was walking the floor. </s>
<s>  at two she was almost frantic. </s>
<s>  at half past she almost wished that she had had the good sense to have some lunch, since she was very hungry and under tense nerve strain. </s>
<s>  once she paused before the glass, but what she saw frightened her. </s>
<s>  just when she felt that she could not endure the strain another minute, grinding brakes, the blast of a huge klaxon, and the sound of a great voice arose from the street. </s>
<s>  eileen rushed to the window. </s>
<s>  she took one look, caught up the suitcase and raced down the stairs. </s>
<s>  at the door she met a bluff, big man, gross from head to foot. </s>
<s>  it seemed to eileen strange that she could see in him even a trace of her mother, and yet she could. </s>
<s>  red veins crossed his cheeks and glowed on his nose. </s>
<s>  his tired eyes were watery. </s>
<s>  his thick lips had an inclination to sag. </s>
<s>  but there was heartiness in his voice and earnestness in the manner in which he picked her up. </s>
<s>   "what have they been doing to you down here?" he demanded. </s>
<s>  "never should have left you this long. </s>
<s>  ought to have come down and taken you and showed you what you wanted, and then you would have known whether you wanted it or not. </s>
<s> " at this juncture a huge woman, gross in a feminine way as her husband was in his, paddled up the walk. </s>
<s>  "i am comin' in and rest a few minutes," she said. </s>
<s>  "i am tired to death and i am pounded to pieces. </s>
<s> " her husband turned toward her. </s>
<s>  he opened his lips to introduce eileen. </s>
<s>  his wife forestalled him. </s>
<s>  "so this is the eileen you have been ravin' about for years," she said. </s>
<s>  "i thought you said she was a pretty girl. </s>
<s> " eileen's soul knew one sick instant of recoil. </s>
<s>  she looked from james heitman to caroline, his wife, and remembered that he had a habit of calling her "callie. </s>
<s> " all that paint and powder and lipstick and brilliantine could do to make the ponderous, big woman more ghastly had been done, but in the rush of the long ride through which her husband had forced her, the colors had mixed and slipped, the false waves were displaced. </s>
<s>  she was not in any condition to criticize the appearance of another woman. </s>
<s>  for one second eileen hesitated, then she lifted her shaking hands to her hat. </s>
<s>  "i have been hounded out of my senses," she said apologetically, "and have been so terribly anxious for fear you wouldn't get here on time. </s>
<s>  please, aunt caroline, let us go to a hotel, some place where we can straighten up comfortably. </s>
<s> " "well, what's your hurry?" said aunt caroline coolly. </s>
<s>  "you're not a fugitive from justice, are you? can't a body rest a few minutes and have a drink, even? besides, i am going to see what kind of a place you've been living in, and then i'll know how thankful you'll be for what we got to offer. </s>
<s> " eileen turned and threw open the door. </s>
<s>  the big woman walked in. </s>
<s>  she looked down the hall, up the stairway, and went on to the living room. </s>
<s>  she gave it one contemptuous glance, and turning, came back to the door. </s>
<s>  "all right, jim," she said brusquely. </s>
<s>  "i have seen enough. </s>
<s>  if you know the best hotel in the town, take me there. </s>
<s>  and then, if eileen's in such a hurry, after we have had a bite we'll start for home. </s>
<s> " "thank you, aunt caroline, oh, thank you!" cried eileen. </s>
<s>  "you needn't take the trouble to 'aunt' me every time you speak to me," said the lady. </s>
<s>  "i know you're my niece, but i ain't goin' to remind you of it every time i speak to you. </s>
<s>  it's agein', this 'auntie' business. </s>
<s>  i don't stand for it, and as for a name, i am free to confess i always like the way jim calls me 'callie. </s>
<s> ' that sounds younger and more companionable than 'caroline. </s>
<s> ' " james heitman looked at eileen and winked. </s>
<s>  "you just bet, old girl!" he said. </s>
<s>  "they ain't any of them can beat you, not even eileen at her best. </s>
<s>  let's get her out of here. </s>
<s>  does this represent your luggage, girlie?" "you said not to bother with anything else," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "so i did," said uncle jim, "and i meant just what i said if it's all right with you. </s>
<s>  i suppose i did have, in the back of my head, an idea that there might be a trunk or a box--some things that belonged to your mother, mebby, and your 'keepsakes. </s>
<s> '" "oh, never mind," interrupted eileen. </s>
<s>  "do let's go. </s>
<s>  it's nearly four o'clock. </s>
<s>  any minute they may send for me from the bank, and i would be more than glad to be out of the way. </s>
<s> " "well, i am not accustomed to being the porter, but if time's that precious, here we go," said uncle jim. </s>
<s>  he picked up the suitcase with one hand and took his wife's arm with the other. </s>
<s>   "scoot down there and climb into that boat," he said proudly to eileen. </s>
<s>  "we'll have a good dinner in a private room when we get to the hotel. </s>
<s>  i won't even register. </s>
<s>  and then we'll get out of here when we have rested a little. </s>
<s> " "can't we stay all night and go in the morning?" panted his wife. </s>
<s>  "no, ma'am, we can't," said james heitman authoritatively. </s>
<s>  "we'll eat a bite because we need to be fed up, and i sincerely hope they's some decent grub to be had in this burg. </s>
<s>  the first place we come to outside of here, that looks like they had a decent bed, we'll stop and make up for last night. </s>
<s>  but we ain't a-goin' to stay here if eileen wants us to start right away, eh, eileen?" "yes, please!" panted eileen. </s>
<s>  "i just don't want to meet any of them. </s>
<s>  it's time enough for them to know what has happened after i am gone. </s>
<s> " "all right then," said uncle james. </s>
<s>  "pile in and we'll go. </s>
<s> " so eileen started on the road to the unlimited wealth her soul had always craved. </s>
<s>  chapter xxiv. </s>
<s>  linda's first party at the bank linda and john gilman waited an hour past the time set for eileen's appearance. </s>
<s>  then linda asserted herself. </s>
<s>  "i have had a feeling for some time," she said quietly, "that eileen would not appear today, and if she doesn't see fit to come, there is no particular reason why she should. </s>
<s>  there is nothing to do but go over the revenue from the estate. </s>
<s>  the books will show what eileen has drawn monthly for her expense budget. </s>
<s>  that can be set aside and the remainder divided equally between us. </s>
<s>  it's very simple. </s>
<s>  here is a letter i wrote to the publishers of father's books asking about royalties. </s>
<s>  i haven't even opened it. </s>
<s>  i will turn it in with the remainder of the business. </s>
<s> " they were in the office with the president of the bank. </s>
<s>  he rang for the clerk he wanted and the books he required, and an hour's rapid figuring settled the entire matter, with the exception of the private account, amounting to several thousands, standing in eileen's name. </s>
<s>  none of them knew any source of separate income she might have. </s>
<s>  at a suggestion from linda, the paying teller was called in and asked if he could account for any of the funds that had gone into the private account. </s>
<s>  "not definitely," he said, "but the amounts always corresponded exactly with the royalties from the books. </s>
<s>  i strongly suspect that they constitute this private account of miss eileen's. </s>
<s> "  but he did not say that she had tried to draw it the day previous. </s>
<s>  john gilman made the suggestion that they should let the matter rest until eileen explained about it. </s>
<s>  then linda spoke very quietly, but with considerable finality in her tone. </s>
<s>  "no," she said, "i know that eileen had no source of private income. </s>
<s>  mother used to mention that she had some wealthy relatives in san francisco, but they didn't approve of her marriage to what they called a 'poor doctor,' and she would never accept, or allow us to accept, anything from them. </s>
<s>  they never came to see us and we never went to see them. </s>
<s>  eileen knows no more about them than i do. </s>
<s>  we will work upon the supposition that everything that is here belonged to father. </s>
<s>  set aside to eileen's credit the usual amount for housekeeping expenses. </s>
<s>  turn the private account in with the remainder. </s>
<s>  start two new bank books, one for eileen and one for me. </s>
<s>  divide the surplus each month exactly in halves. </s>
<s>  and i believe this is the proper time for the bank to turn over to me a certain key, specified by my father as having been left in your possession to be delivered to me on my coming of age. </s>
<s> " with the key in her possession, linda and john gilman left the bank. </s>
<s>  as they stood for a moment in front of the building, gilman removed his hat and ran his hands through his hair as if it were irritating his head. </s>
<s>  "linda," he said in a deeply wistful tone, "i don't understand this. </s>
<s>  why shouldn't eileen have come today as she agreed? what is there about this that is not according to law and honor and the plain, simple rights of the case?" "i don't know," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but there is something we don't understand about it. </s>
<s>  and i am going to ask you, john, as my guardian, closing up my affairs today, to go home with me to be present when i open the little hidden door i found at the back of a library shelf when i was disposing of daddy's technical books. </s>
<s>  there was a slip of paper at the edge of it specifying that the key was in possession of the consolidated bank and was to be delivered to me, in the event of daddy's passing, on my coming of age. </s>
<s>  i have the key, but i would like to have you with me, and eileen if she is in the house, when i open that door. </s>
<s>  i don't know what is behind it, but there's a certain feeling that always has been strong in my heart and it never was so strong as it is at this minute. </s>
<s> " so they boarded the street car and ran out to lilac valley. </s>
<s>  when katy admitted them linda put her arm around her and kissed her. </s>
<s>  she could see that the house was freshly swept and beautifully decorated with flowers, and her trained nostrils could scent whiffs of delicious odors from food of which she was specially fond. </s>
<s>  in all her world katy was the one person who was celebrating her birthday. </s>
<s>  she seemed rather surprised when linda and gilman came in together. </s>
<s>  "where is eileen?" inquired linda. </s>
<s>  "she must have made some new friends," said katy. </s>
<s>  "about four o'clock, the biggest car that ever roared down this street rolled up, and the biggest man and woman that i ever see came puffin' and pantin' in. </s>
<s>  miss eileen did not tell me where she was goin' or when she would be back, but i know it won't be the night, because she took her little dressin' case with her. </s>
<s>  belike it's another of them trips to riverside or pasadena. </s>
<s> " "very likely," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "katy, can you spare a few minutes?" "no, lambie, i jist can't," said katy, "because a young person that's the apple of me eye is havin' a birthday the day and i have got me custard cake in the oven and the custard is in the makin', and after miss eileen went and i didn't see no chance for nothin' special, i jist happened to look out, one of the ways ye do things unbeknownst to yourself, and there stood mr. </s>

<s>  pater morrison, it's a good friend ye were to the young missus when ye engineered her skylight and her beautiful fireplace, and this bein' her birthday, i am takin' the liberty to ask ye to come to dinner and help me celebrate. </s>
<s> ' and he said he would run up to the garage and get into his raygimentals, whatever them might be, and he would be here at six o'clock. </s>
<s>  so ye got a guest for dinner, and if the custard's scorched and the cake's flat, it's up to ye for kapin' me here to tell ye all this. </s>
<s> " then katy hurried to the kitchen. </s>
<s>  linda looked at john gilman and smiled. </s>
<s>  "isn't that like her?" she said. </s>
<s>  then she led the way to the library, pulled aside the books, fitted the key to the little door, and opened it. </s>
<s>  inside lay a single envelope, sealed and bearing her name. </s>
<s>  she took the envelope, and walking to her father's chair beside his library table, sat down in it, and laying the envelope on the table, crossed her hands on top of it. </s>
<s>  "john," she said, "ever since i have been big enough to think and reason and study things out for myself, there is a feeling i have had--i used to think it was unreasonable, then i thought it remote possibility. </s>
<s>  this minute i think it's extremely probable. </s>
<s>  before i open this envelope i am going to tell you what i believe it contains. </s>
<s>  i have not the slightest evidence except personal conviction, but i believe that the paper inside this envelope is written by my father's hand and i believe it tells me that he was not eileen's father and that i am not her sister. </s>
<s>  if it does not say this, then there is nothing in race and blood and inherited tendencies. </s>
<s> " linda picked up the paper cutter, ran it across the envelope, slipped out the sheet, and bracing herself she read: my darling linda: these lines are to tell you that your mother went to her eternal sleep when you were born. </s>
<s>  four years later i met and fell in love with the only mother you ever have known. </s>
<s>  at the time of our marriage we entered into a solemn compact that her little daughter by a former marriage and mine should be reared as sisters. </s>
<s>  i was to give half my earnings and to do for eileen exactly as i did for you. </s>
<s>  she was to give half her love and her best attention to your interests. </s>
<s>  i sincerely hope that what i have done will not result in any discomfort or inconvenience to you. </s>
<s>  with dearest love, as ever your father, alexander strong. </s>
<s>  linda laid the sheet on the table and dropped her hands on top of it. </s>
<s>  then she looked at john gilman. </s>
<s>  "john," she said, "i believe you had better face the fact that the big car and the big people that carried eileen away today were her mother's wealthy relatives from san francisco. </s>
<s>  she must have been in touch with them. </s>
<s>  i think very likely she sent for them after i saw her in the bank yesterday afternoon, trying with all her might to make the paying teller turn over to her the funds of the private account. </s>
<s> " john gilman sat very still for a long time, then he raised tired, disappointed eyes to linda's face. </s>
<s>  "linda," he said, "do you mean you think eileen was not straight about money matters?" "john," said linda quietly, "i think it is time for the truth about eileen between you and me. </s>
<s>  if you want me to answer that question candidly, i'll answer it. </s>
<s> " ù"i want the truth," said john gilman gravely. </s>
<s>  "well," said linda, "i never knew eileen to be honest about anything in all her life unless the truth served her better than an evasion. </s>
<s>  her hair was not honest color and it was not honest curl. </s>
<s>  her eyebrows were not so dark as she made them. </s>
<s>  her cheeks and lips were not so red, her forehead and throat were not so white, her form was not so perfect. </s>
<s>  her friends were selected because they could serve her. </s>
<s>  as long as you were poor and struggling, marian was welcome to you. </s>
<s>  when you won a great case and became prosperous and fame came rapidly, eileen took you. </s>
<s>  i believe what i told you a minute ago: i think she has gone for good. </s>
<s>  i think she went because she had not been fair and she would not be forced to face the fact before you and me and the president of the consolidated today. </s>
<s>  i think you will have to take your heart home tonight and i think that before the night is over you will realize what marian felt when she knew that in addition to having been able to take you from her, eileen was not a woman who would make you happy. </s>
<s>  i am glad, deeply g]ad, that there is not a drop of her blood in my veins, sorry as i am for you and much as i regret what has happened. </s>
<s>  i won't ask you to stay tonight, because you must go through the same black waters marian breasted, and you will want to be alone. </s>
<s>  later, if you think of any way i can serve you, i will be glad for old sake's sake. </s>
<s>  but you must not expect me ever to love you or respect your judgment as i did before the shadow fell. </s>
<s> " then linda rose, replaced the letter, turned the key in the lock, and quietly slipped out of the room. </s>
<s>  when she opened her door and stepped into her room she paused in astonishment. </s>
<s>  spread out upon the bed lay a dress of georgette with little touches of fur and broad ribbons of satin. </s>
<s>  in color it was like the flame of seasoned beechwood. </s>
<s>  across the foot of the bed hung petticoat, camisole, and hose, and beside the dress a pair of satin slippers exactly matching the hose, and they seemed the right size. </s>
<s>  linda tiptoed to the side of the bed and delicately touched the dress, and then she saw a paper lying on the waist front, and picking it up read: lambie, here's your birthday, from loving old katy. </s>
<s>  the lines were terse and to the point. </s>
<s>  linda laid them down, and picking up the dress she walked to the mirror, and holding it under her chin glanced down the length of its reflection. </s>
<s>  what she saw almost stunned her. </s>
<s>  "oh, good lord!" she said. </s>
<s>  "i can't wear that. </s>
<s>  that isn't me. </s>
<s> " then she tossed the dress on the bed and started in a headlong rush to the kitchen. </s>
<s>  as she came through the door, "you blessed old darling!" she cried. </s>
<s>  "what am i going to say to make you know how i appreciate your lovely, lovely gift?" katy raised her head. </s>
<s>  there was something that is supposed to be the prerogative of royalty in the lift of it. </s>
<s>  her smile was complacent in the extreme. </s>
<s>  "don't ye be standin' there wastin' no time talkie'," she said. </s>
<s>  "i have oodles of time," said linda, "but i warn you, you won't know me if i put on that frock, katy. </s>
<s> " "yes, i will, too," said katy. </s>
<s>  "katy," said linda, sobering suddenly, "would it make any great difference to you if i were the only one here for always, after this?" katy laughed contemptuously. </s>
<s>  "well, i would warrant to survive it," she said coolly. </s>
<s>  "but that is exactly what i must tell you, katy," said linda soberly. </s>
<s>  "you know i have told you a number of times through these years that i did not believe eileen and i were sisters, and i am telling you now that i know it. </s>
<s>  she did not come to the bank today, and the settlement of father's affairs developed the fact that i was my father's child and eileen was her mother's. </s>
<s>  and i am thinking, katy, that the big car you saw and the opulent people in it were eileen's mother's wealthy relatives from san francisco. </s>
<s>  my guess is, katy, that eileen has gone with them for good. </s>
<s>  lock her door and don't touch her things until we know certainly what she wants done with them. </s>
<s> " katy stood thinking intently, then she lifted her eyes to linda's. </s>
<s>  "lambie," she whispered softly, "are we ixpicted to go into mourning over this?" a mischievous light leaped into linda's eyes. </s>
<s>  "well, if there are any such expectations abroad, katherine o'donovan," she said soberly, "the saints preserve 'em, for we can't fulfill 'em, can we, katy?" "not to be savin' our souls," answered katy heartily. </s>
<s>  "i am jist so glad and thankful that i don't know what to do, and it's such good news that i don't belave one word of it. </s>
<s>  and while you're talkie', what about john gilman?" "i think," said linda quietly, "that tonight is going to teach him how marian felt in her blackest hours. </s>
<s> " "well, he needn't be coming to me for sympathy," said katy. </s>
<s>  "but if miss eileen has gone to live with the folks that come after her the day, ye might be savin' a wee crap o' sympathy for her, lambie. </s>
<s>  they was jist the kind of people that you'd risk your neck slidin' down a mountain to get out of their way. </s>
<s> " "that is too bad," said linda reflectively. </s>
<s>  "because eileen is sensitive and constant contact with crass vulgarity certainly would wear on her nerves. </s>
<s> " "now you be goin' and gettin' into that dress, lambie," said katy. </s>
<s>  "katherine o'donovan," said linda, "you're used to it. </s>
<s>  come again to confession. </s>
<s>  tell me truly where and how did you get that dress?" "'tain't no rule of polite society to be lookin' gift horses in the mouth," said katy proudly. </s>
<s>  "how i got it is me own affair, jist like ye got any gifts ye was ever makin' me, is yours. </s>
<s>  where i got it? i went into the city on the strafe car and i went to the biggest store in the city and i got in the elevator and i says to the naygur: 'let me off where real ladies buy ready-to-wear dresses. </s>
<s> ' "and up comes a little woman, and her hair was jist as soft and curling round her ears, and brown and pretty was her eyes, and the pink that god made was in her cheeks, and in a voice like runnin' water she says: 'could i do anything for you?' i told her what i wanted. </s>
<s>  and she says: 'how old is the young lady, and what's her size, and what's her color?' darlin', ain't that dress the answer to what i told her?" "yes," said linda. </s>
<s>  "if an artist had been selecting a dress for me he would probably have chosen that one. </s>
<s>   old dear, it's not suitable for me. </s>
<s>  it's not the kind of dress that i intended to wear for years and years yet. </s>
<s>  do you think, if i put it on tonight, i'll ever be able to go back to boots and breeches again, and hunt the canyons for plants to cook for--you know what?" katy stood in what is commonly designated as a "brown study. </s>
<s> " then she looked linda over piercingly. </s>
<s>  "yes, ma'am," she said conclusively. </s>
<s>  "it's my judgment that ye will. </s>
<s>  i think ye'll maybe wrap the braids of ye around your head tonight, and i think ye'll put on that frock, and i think ye'll show pater morrison how your pa's daughter can sit at the head of his table and entertain her friends. </s>
<s>  then i think ye'll hang it in your closet and put on your boots and breeches and go back to your old multiflores and attind to your business, the same as before. </s>
<s> " "all right, katy," said linda, "if you have that much faith in me i have that much faith in myself. </s>
<s>   old dear, i can't tell you how i love having a pretty dress for tonight. </s>
<s>  katy dear, the 'day of jubilee' has come. </s>
<s>  before you go to sleep i am coming to your room to tell you fine large secrets, that you won't believe for a minute, but i haven't the time to do it now. </s>
<s> " then linda raced to her room and began dressing. </s>
<s>  she let down the mop of her hair waving below her waist and looked at it despairingly. </s>
<s>  "that dress never was made for braids down your back," she said, glancing toward the bed where it lay shimmering in a mass of lovely color. </s>
<s>  "i am of age today. </s>
<s>  for state occasions i should be a woman. </s>
<s>  what shall i do with it?" and then she recalled katy's voice saying: "braids round your head. </s>
<s> " "of course," said linda, "that would be the thing to do. </s>
<s>  i certainly don't need anything to add to my height. </s>
<s>  i am far too tall now. </s>
<s> " so she parted her hair in the middle, brushed it back, divided it in even halves, and instead of braiding it, she coiled it around her head, first one side and then the other. </s>
<s>  she slipped into the dress and struggled with its many and intricate fastenings. </s>
<s>  then she went to the guest room to stand before the full-length mirror there. </s>
<s>  slowly she turned. </s>
<s>  critically she examined herself. </s>
<s>   "it's a bit shorter than i would have ordered it," she said, "but it reduces my height, it certainly gives wonderful freedom in walking, and it's not nearly so short as i see other girls wearing. </s>
<s> " again she studied herself critically. </s>
<s>  "need some kind of ornament for my hair," she muttered, "but i haven't got it, and neither do i own beads, bracelet, or a ring. </s>
<s>  and my ears are sticking right out in the air. </s>
<s>  i am almost offensively uncovered. </s>
<s> "  then she went down to show herself to a delighted katy. </s>
<s>  when the doorbell rang linda turned toward the hall. </s>
<s>  katy reached a detaining hand. </s>
<s>  "you'll do nothing of the sort," she said. </s>
<s>  "i answered the bell for miss eileen. </s>
<s>  answer the bell i shall for you. </s>
<s> " down the hall went katy with the light of battle in her eyes and the air of a conqueror in the carriage of her head. </s>
<s>  she was well trained. </s>
<s>  neither eyelid quivered as she flung the door wide to peter morrison. </s>
<s>  he stood there in dinner dress, more imposing than katy had thought he could be. </s>
<s>  with quick, inner exultation she reached for two parcels he carried. </s>
<s>  over them her delight was so overpowering that peter morrison must have seen a hint of it. </s>
<s>  with a flourish katy seated him, and carried the packages to linda. </s>
<s>  she returned a second later for a big vase, and in this linda arranged a great sheaf of radiant roses. </s>
<s>  as katy started to carry them back to the room, linda said "wait a second," and selecting one half opened, she slipped it out, shortened the stem and tucked it among the coils of hair where she would have set an ornament. </s>
<s>  the other package was a big box that when opened showed its interior to be divided into compartments in each of which nestled an exquisite flower made of spun sugar. </s>
<s>  the petals, buds, and leaves were perfect. </s>
<s>  there were wonderful roses with pale pink outer petals and deeper-colored hearts. </s>
<s>  there were pink mallows that seemed as if they must have been cut from the bushes bordering santa monica road. </s>
<s>  there were hollyhocks of white and gold, and simply perfect tulips. </s>
<s>  linda never before had seen such a treasure candy box. </s>
<s>  she cried out in delight, and hurried to show katy. </s>
<s>  in her pleasure over the real flowers and the candy flowers linda forgot her dress, but when she saw peter morrison standing tall and straight, in dinner dress, she stopped and looked the surprise and pleasure she felt. </s>
<s>  she had grown accustomed to peter in khaki pottering around his building. </s>
<s>  this peter she never before had seen. </s>
<s>  he represented something of culture, something of pride, a conformity to a nice custom and something more. </s>
<s>  linda was not a psychoanalyst. </s>
<s>  she could not see a wonderful aura of exquisite color enveloping peter. </s>
<s>  but when peter saw the girl approaching him, transformed into a woman whose shining coronet was jewelled with his living red rose, when he saw the beauty of her lithe slenderness clothed in a soft, flaming color, something emanated from his inner consciousness that linda did see, and for an instant it disturbed her as she went forward holding out her hands. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said gaily, "do you know that this is my day of jubilee? i am a woman today by law, peter. </s>
<s>  hereafter i am to experience at least a moderate degree of financial freedom, and that i shall enjoy. </s>
<s>  but the greatest thing in life is friends. </s>
<s> " peter took both the hands extended to him and looked smilingly into her eyes. </s>
<s>  "you take my breath," he said. </s>
<s>  "i knew, the first glimpse i ever had of you scrambling from the canyon floor, that this transformation could take place. </s>
<s>  my good fortune is beyond words that i have been first to see it. </s>
<s>  permit me, fair lady. </s>
<s> " peter bent and kissed both her hands. </s>
<s>  he hesitated a second, then he turned the right hand and left one more kiss in its palm. </s>
<s>  "to have and to hold!" he said whimsically. </s>
<s>  "thank you," said linda, closing her fist over it and holding it up for inspection. </s>
<s>  "i'll see that it doesn't escape. </s>
<s>  and this minute i thank you for the candy, which i know is delicious, and for my very first sheaf of roses from any man. </s>
<s>  see what i have done with one of them?" she turned fully around that he might catch the effect of the rose, and in getting that he also got the full effect of the costume, and the possibilities of the girl before him. </s>
<s>  and then she gave him a shock. </s>
<s>  "isn't it a lovely frock?" she said. </s>
<s>  "another birthday gift from the strong rock of ages. </s>
<s>  i have been making a collection of rocks for my fern bed, and i have got another collection that is not visible to anyone save myself. </s>
<s>  katy's a rock, and you're a rock, and donald is a rock, and marian's a rock, and i am resting securely on all of you. </s>
<s>  i wish my father knew that in addition to marian and katy i have found two more such wonderful friends. </s>
<s> " "and what about henry anderson?" inquired peter. </s>
<s>  "aren't you going to include him?" linda walked over to the chair in which she intended to seat herself. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said, "i wish you hadn't asked me that. </s>
<s> " peter's figure tensed suddenly. </s>
<s>  "look here, linda," he said sternly, "has that rather bold youngster made himself in any way offensive to you?" "not in any way that i am not perfectly capable of handling myself," said linda. </s>
<s>  she looked at peter confidently. </s>
<s>  "do you suppose," she said, "that i can sit down in this thing without ruining it? shouldn't i really stand up while i am wearing it?" peter laughed unrestrainedly. </s>
<s>  "linda, you're simply delicious," he said. </s>
<s>  "it seems to me that i have seen young ladies in like case reach round and gather the sash to one side and smooth out the skirt as they sit. </s>
<s> " "thank you, peter, of course that would be the way," said linda. </s>
<s>  "this being my first, i am lacking in experience. </s>
<s> " and thereupon she sat according to direction. </s>
<s>  while peter sat opposite her. </s>
<s>  "now finish. </s>
<s>  just one word more about henry anderson," he said. </s>
<s>  "are you perfectly sure there is nothing i need do for you in that connection?" "oh, perfectly," said linda lightly. </s>
<s>  "i didn't mean to alarm you. </s>
<s>  he merely carried that bug-catcher nonsense a trifle too far. </s>
<s>  i wouldn't have minded humoring him and fooling about it a little. </s>
<s>   peter, do you know him quite well? are you very sure of him?" "no," said peter, "i don't know him well at all. </s>
<s>  the only thing i am sure about him is that he is doing well in his profession. </s>
<s>  i chose him because he was an ambitious youngster and i thought i could get more careful attention from him than i could from some of the older fellows who had made their reputation. </s>
<s>  you see, there are such a lot of things i want to know about in this building proposition, and the last four years haven't been a time for any man to be careful about saving his money. </s>
<s> " "then," said linda, "he is all right, of course. </s>
<s>  he must be. </s>
<s>  but i think i am like a cat. </s>
<s>  i am very complacent with certain people, but when i begin to get goose flesh and hair prickles my head a bit, i realize that there is something antagonistic around, something for me to beware of. </s>
<s>  i guess it's because i am such a wild creature. </s>
<s> " "do you mean to say," said peter, "that these are the sensations that henry gives you?" linda nodded. </s>
<s>  "now forget henry," she said. </s>
<s>  "i have had such a big day i must tell you about it, and then we'll come to that last article you left me. </s>
<s>  i haven't had time to put anything on paper concerning it yet, but i believe i have an awfully good idea in the paint pot, and i'll find time in a day or two to work it out. </s>
<s>  peter, i have just come from the bank, where i was recognized as of legal age, and my guardian discharged. </s>
<s>  and perhaps i ought to explain to you, peter, that your friend, john gilman, is not here because this night is going to be a bad one for him. </s>
<s>  when you knew him best he was engaged, or should have been, to marian thorne. </s>
<s>  when you met him this time he really was engaged to eileen. </s>
<s>  i don't know what you think about eileen. </s>
<s>  i don't feel like influencing anyone's thought concerning her, so i'll merely say that today has confirmed a conviction that always has been in my heart. </s>
<s>  katy could tell you that long ago i said to her that i did not believe eileen was my sister. </s>
<s>  today has brought me the knowledge and proof positive that she is not, and today she has gone to some wealthy relatives of her mother in san francisco. </s>
<s>  she expressed her contempt for what she was giving up by leaving everything, including the exquisite little necklace of pearls which has been a daily part of her since she owned them. </s>
<s>  i may be mistaken, but intuition tells me that with the pearls and the wardrobe she has also discarded john gilman. </s>
<s>  i think your friend will be suffering tonight quite as deeply as my friend suffered when john abandoned her at a time when she had lost everything else in life but her money. </s>
<s>  i feel very sure that we won't see eileen any more. </s>
<s>  i hope she will have every lovely thing in life. </s>
<s> " "amen," said peter morrison earnestly. </s>
<s>  "i loved john gilman when we were in school together, but i have not been able to feel, since i located here, that he is exactly the same john. </s>
<s>  and what you have told me very probably explains the difference in him. </s>
<s> " when katy announced dinner linda arose. </s>
<s>  peter morrison stepped beside her and offered his arm. </s>
<s>  linda rested her finger tips upon it and he led her to the head of the table and seated her. </s>
<s>  then katy served a meal that, if it had been prepared for eileen, she would have described as a banquet. </s>
<s>  she gave them delicious, finely flavored food, stimulating, exquisitely compounded drinks that she had concocted from the rich fruits of california and mints and essences at her command. </s>
<s>  when, at the close of the meal, she brought morrison some of the cigars eileen kept for john gilman, she set a second tray before linda, and this tray contained two packages. </s>
<s>  linda looked at katy inquiringly, and katy, her face beaming, nodded her sandy red head emphatically. </s>
<s>  "more birthday gifts you've havin', me lady," she said in her mellowest irish voice. </s>
<s>  "more?" marveled linda. </s>
<s>  she picked up the larger package, and opening it, found a beautiful book inscribed from her friend donald, over which she passed caressing fingers. </s>
<s>  "why, how lovely of him!" she said. </s>
<s>  "how in this world did he know?" katherine o'donovan could have answered that question, but she did not. </s>
<s>  the other package was from marian. </s>
<s>  when she opened it linda laughed unrestrainedly. </s>
<s>  "what a joke!" she said. </s>
<s>  "i had promised myself that i would not touch a thing in eileen's room, and before i could do justice to katy's lovely dress i had to go there for pins for my hair and powder for my nose. </s>
<s>  this is marian's way of telling me that i am almost a woman. </s>
<s>  will you look at this?" "well, just what is it?" inquired peter. </s>
<s>  "hairpins," laughed linda, "and hair ornaments, and a box of face powder, and the little, feminine touches that my dressing table needs badly. </s>
<s>  how would you like, peter, to finish your cigar in my workroom?" "i would like it immensely," said peter. </s>
<s>  so together they climbed to the top of the house. </s>
<s>  linda knelt and made a little ceremony of lighting the first fire in her fireplace. </s>
<s>  she pushed one of her chairs to one side for peter, and taking the other for herself, she sat down and began the process of really becoming acquainted with him. </s>
<s>  two hours later, as he was leaving her, peter made a circuit of the room, scrutinizing the sketches and paintings that were rapidly covering the walls, and presently he came to the wasp. </s>
<s>  he looked at it so closely that he did not miss even the stinger. </s>
<s>  linda stood beside him when he made his first dazed comment: "if that isn't eileen, and true to the life!" "i must take that down," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i did it one night when my heart was full of bitterness. </s>
<s> " "better leave it," said peter drily. </s>
<s>  "do you think i need it as a warning?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  peter turned and surveyed her slowly. </s>
<s>  "linda," he said quietly, "what i think of you has not yet been written in any of the books. </s>
<s> " chapter xxv. </s>
<s>  buena moza as soon as peter had left her linda took her box of candy flowers and several of her finest roses and went to katy's room. </s>
<s>  she found katy in a big rocking chair, her feet on a hassock, reading a story in everybody's home. </s>
<s>  when her door opened and she saw her young mistress framed in it she tossed the magazine aside and sprang to her feet, but linda made her resume her seat. </s>
<s>  the girl shortened the stems of the roses and put them in a vase on katy's dresser. </s>
<s>  "they may clash with your coloring a mite, mother machree," she said, "but by themselves they are very wonderful things, aren't they?" linda went over, and drawing her dress aside, sat down on the hassock and leaning against katy's knee she held up the box of candy flowers for amazed and delighted inspection. </s>
<s>  "ah, the foine gintleman!" cried katy. </s>
<s>  "sure 'twas only a pape i had when ye opened the box, an' i didn't know how rare them beauties railly was. </s>
<s> " "choose the one you like best," said linda. </s>
<s>  but katy would not touch the delicate things, so linda selected a brushy hollyhock for her and then sat at her knee again. </s>
<s>  "katherine o'donovan," she said solemnly, "it's up to a couple of young things such as we are, stranded on the shoals of the pacific as we have been, to put our heads together and take counsel. </s>
<s>  you're a host, katy, and while i am taking care of you, i'll be just delighted to have you go on looking after your black sheep. </s>
<s>  but it's going to be lonely, for all that. </s>
<s>  after eileen has taken her personal possessions, what do you say to fixing up that room with the belongings that marian kept, and inviting her to make that suite her home until such time as she may have a home of her own again?" "foine!" cried katy. </s>
<s>  "i would love to be havin' her. </s>
<s>  i would agree to take orders from miss marian and to be takin' care of her jist almost the same as i do of ye, miss linda. </s>
<s>  the one thing i don't like about it is that it ain't fair nor right to give even marian the best. </s>
<s>  ye be takin' that suite yourself, lambie, and give miss marian your room all fixed up with her things, or, if ye want her nearer, give her the guest room and make a guest room of yours. </s>
<s> " "i am willing to follow either of the latter suggestions for myself," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it might be pleasant to be across the hall from marian where we could call back and forth to each other. </s>
<s>  i wouldn't mind a change as soon as i have time to get what i would need to make the change. </s>
<s>  i'll take the guest room for mine, and you may call in a decorator and have my room freshly done and the guest things moved into it. </s>
<s> " katy looked belligerent. </s>
<s>  linda reached up and touched the frowning lines on her forehead. </s>
<s>  "brighten your lovely features with a smile, katherine me dear," she said gaily. </s>
<s>  "don't be forgetting that this is our day of jubilee. </s>
<s>  we are free--i hope we are free forever--from petty annoyances and dissatisfactions and little, galling things that sear the soul and bring out all the worst in human nature. </s>

<s>  if marian will give me permission to move and install her things in it, i think she can use it without any such feeling, but i couldn't. </s>
<s>  it's agreed then, katy, i am to write to marian and extend to her a welcome on your part as well as on mine?" "that ye may, lambie," said katy heartily. </s>
<s>  " as the boss used to be sabin', just to make assurance doubly sure, if you would address it for me i would be writing' a bit of a line myself, conveying' to her me sentiments on the subject. </s>
<s> " "oh, fine, katy. </s>
<s>  marian would be delighted!" cried linda, springing up. </s>
<s>  " katy dear, it won't make us feel any more like mourning for eileen when i tell you that it developed at the bank yesterday and today, that since she has been managing household affairs she has deposited in a separate account all the royalties from father's books. </s>
<s>  i had thought the matter closed at the bank when this fund was added to the remainder of the estate, the household expenses set aside to eileen, and the remainder divided equally between us. </s>
<s>  i didn't get the proof that she was not my sister until after i came home. </s>
<s>  i think it means that i shall have to go back to the bank, have the matter reopened, and unless she can produce a will or something proving that she is entitled to it, it seems to me that what remains of my father's estate is legally mine. </s>
<s>  of course, if it develops that he has made any special provision for her, she shall have it. </s>
<s>  otherwise, katy, we'll be in a position to install you as housekeeper and put some light-footed, capable young person under you for a step-saver in any direction you want to use her. </s>
<s>  it means, too, that i shall be able to repay your loan immediately and to do the things that i wanted to do about the house. </s>
<s> " "now i ain't in any hurry about that money, lambie," said katy. </s>
<s>  "and you understand of course that the dress you're wearing' i am given' ye. </s>

<s>  "was you telling' him that the dress ye were wearing' was a present from your old cook?" "why, certainly i was," said linda, wide eyed with astonish meet. </s>
<s>  "why shouldn't i? i was proud to. </s>
<s>  and now, old dear, before i go, the biggest secret of all. </s>

<s>  he likes the pictures i make. </s>
<s>   katy, you won't believe it till i show you my little bank book, but for the three already published with their illustrations he pays me five hundred nice, long, smooth, beautifully decorated, paper dollars!" "judas praste!" cried katy, her hands once more aloft. </s>
<s>  "ye ain't manin' it, lambie?" "yes, i are," laughed linda. </s>
<s>  "i have got the money. </s>
<s>  and for each succeeding three with their pictures i am to have that much more, and when i finish- -now steady yourself, katy, because this is going to be a shock--when i finish, blessed old dear heart, he is going to make them into a book! that will be my job for this summer, and you shall help me, and it will be a part of our great secret. </s>
<s>  won't it be the most fun?" "my soul!" said katy. </s>
<s>  "you're jist crazy. </s>
<s>  i don't belave a word you're telling' me. </s>
<s> " "but i can prove it, because i have the letter and the bank book," said linda. </s>
<s>  katy threw her arms around the girl and kissed the top of her head and cried over her and laughed at the same time and patted her and petted her and ended by saying: "oh, lambie, if only the master could be knowin' it. </s>
<s> " "but he does know, katy," said linda. </s>
<s>  she went to her room, removed the beautiful dress  arranging it on a hanger, left it in her closet. </s>
<s>  slipping into an old dressing gown, she ran to her workroom and wrote a letter to marian from herself. </s>
<s>  she tried not to tell marian the big, vital thing that was throbbing in her heart all day concerning her work, the great secret that meant such a wonderful thing to her, the thing that was beating in her heart and fluttering behind her lips like a bird trying to escape its cage. </s>
<s>  but she could tell her in detail of eileen's undoubted removal to san francisco. </s>
<s>  she could tell her enough of the financial transactions of the day to make her understand what had been happening in the past. </s>
<s>  and she could tell of her latest interview with john gilman. </s>
<s>  once, as she sat with her pen poised, thinking how to phrase a sentence, linda said to herself: "i wonder in my heart if he won't try to come crawfishing back to marian now, and if he does, i wonder, oh, how i wonder, what she will do. </s>
<s> " linda shut her lips very tight and stared up through her skylight to the stars, as she was fast falling into a habit of doing when she wanted inspiration. </s>
<s>  "well, i know one thing," she said to the shining things above her, "marian will do as she sees fit, of course, but if it were i, and any man had discarded me as john gilman discarded marian, in case he ever wanted to pick me up again he would find i was not there. </s>
<s>  much as i plan in my heart for the home and the man and the little people that i hope to have some day, i would give up all of them before i would be discarded and re-sought like that. </s>
<s>  and knowing marian as i do, i have a conviction that she will feel the same way. </s>
<s>  from the things she is writing about this snow man i think it is highly probable that he may awake some day to learn that he is not so deeply grieved but that he would like to have marian to comfort him in his loneliness. </s>
<s>  and as for his little girl i don't see where he could find a woman who would rear her more judiciously and beautifully than marian would. </s>
<s> " she finished her letter, sealed and stamped it, and then, taking out a fresh sheet, she lettered in at the top of it, "indian potatoes" and continued: and very good potatoes they are. </s>
<s>  you will find these growing everywhere throughout california, blooming from may to july, their six long, slender, white petals shading to gold at the base, grayish on the outside, a pollen-laden pistil upstanding, eight or ten gold-clubbed stamens surrounding it, the slender brown stem bearing a dozen or more of these delicate blooms, springing high from a base of leaves sometimes nearly two feet long and an inch broad, wave margined, spreading in a circle around it. </s>
<s>  in the soil of the plains and the dry hillsides you will find an amazingly large solid bulb, thickly enwrapped in a coat of brown fiber, the long threads of which can be braided, their amazing strength making them suitable for bow strings, lariats, or rope of any kind that must needs be improvised for use at the moment. </s>
<s>  the bulbs themselves have many uses. </s>
<s>  crushed and rubbed up in water they make a delightful cleansing lather. </s>
<s>  the extracted juice, when cooked down, may be used as glue. </s>
<s>  of the roasted bulbs effective poultices for bruises and boils may be made. </s>
<s>  it was an indian custom to dam a small stream and throw in mashed amole bulbs, the effect of which was to stupefy the fish so that they could be picked out by hand. </s>
<s>  all of which does not make it appear that the same bulb would serve as an excellent substitute for a baked potato. </s>
<s>  but we must remember how our grandmothers made starch from our potatoes, used them to break in the new ironware, and to purify the lard. </s>
<s>  which goes to prove that one vegetable may be valuable for many purposes. </s>
<s>  amole, whose ponderous scientific name is chlorogalum pomeridiarum, is at its best for my purposes when all the chlorophyll from flower and stem has been driven back to the bulb, and it lies ripe and fully matured from late august until december. </s>
<s>  remove the fibrous cover down to the second or third layer enclosing the bulb. </s>
<s>  these jackets are necessary as they keep the bulbs from drying out and having a hard crust. </s>
<s>  roast them exactly as you would potatoes. </s>
<s>  when they can easily be pierced with a silver fork remove from the oven, and serve immediately with any course with which you would use baked potatoes. </s>
<s>  "and gee, but they are good!" commented linda as she reread what she had written. </s>
<s>  after that she turned her attention to drawing a hillside whitened here and there with amole bloom showing in its purity against the warm grayish-tan background. </s>
<s>  the waving green leaves ran among big rocks and overlapped surrounding growth. </s>
<s>  at the right of her drawing linda sketched in a fine specimen of monkey flower, deepening the yellow from the hearts of the amole lilies for the almost human little monkey faces. </s>
<s>  on the left one giant specimen of amole, reared from a base of exquisitely waving leaves, ran up the side of the drawing and broke into an airy and graceful head of gold-hearted white lilies. </s>
<s>  for a long time linda sat with poised pencil, studying her foreground. </s>
<s>  what should she introduce that would be most typical of the location and gave her the desired splash of contrasting color that she used as a distinctive touch in the foreground of all her drawings? her pencil flew busily a few minutes while she sketched in a flatly growing bush of prickly phlox, setting the flower faces as closely as the overlapped scales of a fish, setting them even as they grow in nature. </s>
<s>  and when she resorted to the color box she painted these faces a wonderful pink that was not wild rose, not cerise, not lilac, but it made one think of all of them. </s>
<s>  when she could make no further improvement on this sketch, she carefully stretched it against the wall and tacked it up to dry. </s>
<s>  afterward she cleared her mental decks of all the work she could think of in order to have saturday free, because saturday was the day upon which she found herself planning in the back of her mind throughout the strenuous week, to save for riding the king's highway with donald whiting. </s>
<s>  several times she had met him on the walks or in the hallways, and always he had stopped to speak with her and several times he had referred to the high hope in which he waited for saturday. </s>
<s>  linda already had held a consultation with katy on the subject of the lunch basket. </s>
<s>  that matter being satisfactorily arranged, there was nothing for her to do but to double on her work so that saturday would be free. </s>
<s>  friday evening linda was called from the dinner table to the telephone. </s>
<s>  she immediately recognized the voice inquiring for her as that of judge whiting, and then she listened breathlessly while he said to her: "you will recognize that there is very little i may say over a telephone concerning a matter to which you brought my attention. </s>
<s>  i have a very competent man looking into the matter thoroughly, and i find that your fear is amply justified. </s>
<s>  wherever you go or whatever you do, use particular care. </s>
<s>  don't have anything to do with any stranger. </s>
<s>  just use what your judgment and common sense tell you is a reasonable degree of caution in every direction no matter how trivial. </s>
<s>  you understand?" "i do," said linda promptly. </s>
<s>  "would you prefer that we do not go on any more saturday trips at present?" the length of time that the judge waited to answer proved that he had taken time to think. </s>
<s>  "i can't see," he said finally, "that you would not be safer on such a trip where you are moving about, where no one knows who you arc, than you would where you are commonly found. </s>
<s> " "all right then," said linda. </s>
<s>  "ask the party we are considering and he will tell you where he will be tomorrow. </s>
<s>  thank you very much for letting me know. </s>
<s>  if anything should occur, you will understand that it was something quite out of my range of fore-sight. </s>
<s> " "i underst" said the judge. </s>
<s>  with all care and many loving admonitions katy assisted in the start made early saturday morning. </s>
<s>  the previous saturday linda had felt that all nature along the road she planned to drive would be at its best, but they had not gone far until she modified her decision. </s>
<s>  they were slipping through mists of early morning, over level, carefully made roads like pavilion floors. </s>
<s>  if any one objection could have been made, it would have been that the mists of night were weighting too heavily to earth the perfume from the blooming orchards and millions of flowers in gardens and along the roadside. </s>
<s>  at that hour there were few cars abroad. </s>
<s>  linda was dressed in her outing suit of dark green. </s>
<s>  she had removed her hat and slipped it on the seat beside her. </s>
<s>  she looked at donald, a whimsical expression on her most expressive young face. </s>
<s>  "please to 'scuse me," she said lightly, "if i step on the gas a mite while we have the road so much to ourselves and are so familiar with it. </s>
<s>  later, when we reach stranger country and have to share with others, we'll be forced to go slower. </s>
<s> " "don't stint your speed on account of me," said donald. </s>
<s>  "i am just itching to know what kitty can do. </s>
<s> " "all right, here's your chance," said linda. </s>
<s>  "hear her purr?" she settled her body a trifle tensely, squared her shoulders, and gripped the steering wheel. </s>
<s>  then she increased the gas and let the bear cat roll over the smooth road from lilac valley running south into los angeles. </s>
<s>  at a speed that was near to flying as a non-professional attains, the youngsters traveled that road. </s>
<s>  their eyes were shining. </s>
<s>  their blood was racing. </s>
<s>  until the point where rougher roads and approaching traffic forced them to go slower, they raced, and when they slowed down they looked at each other and laughed in morning delight. </s>
<s>  "i may not be very wise," said linda, "but didn't i do the smartest thing when i let eileen have the touring car and saved the bear cat for us?" "nothing short of inspiration," said donald. </s>
<s>  "the height of my ambition is to own a bear cat. </s>
<s>  if father makes any mention of anything i would like particularly to have for a graduation present, i am cocked and primed as to what i shall tell him. </s>
<s> " "you'd better save yourself a disappointment," said linda soberly. </s>
<s>  "you will be starting to college this fall, and when you do you will be gone nine months out of the year, and i am fairly sure your father wouldn't think shipping a bear cat back and forth a good investment, or furnishing you one to take to school with you. </s>
<s>  he would fear you would never make a grade that would be a credit to him if he did. </s>
<s> " "my!" laughed donald, "you've got a long head on your shoulders!" "when you're thrown on your own for four of the longest, lonesomest years of your life, you learn to think," said linda soberly. </s>
<s>  she was touching the beginning of los angeles traffic. </s>
<s>  later she was on the open road again. </s>
<s>  the mists were thinning and lifting. </s>
<s>  the perfume was not so heavy. </s>
<s>  the sheeted whiteness of the orange groves was broken with the paler white of plum merging imperceptibly into the delicate pink of apricot and the stronger pink of peach, and there were deep green orchards of smooth waxen olive foliage and the lacy-leaved walnuts. </s>
<s>  then came the citrus orchards again, and all the way on either hand running with them were almost uninterrupted miles of roses of every color and kind, and everywhere homes ranging from friendly mansions, all written over in adorable flower color with the happy invitation, "come in and make yourself at home," to tiny bungalows along the wayside crying welcome to this gay pair of youngsters in greetings fashioned from white and purple wisteria, gold bignonia, every rose the world knows, and myriad brilliant annual and perennial flower faces gathered from the circumference of the tropical globe and homing enthusiastically on the king's highway. </s>
<s>  sometimes linda lifted her hand from the wheel to wave a passing salute to a particularly appealing flower picture. </s>
<s>  sometimes she whistled a note or cried a greeting to a mockingbird, a rosy finch, or a song sparrow. </s>
<s>  "look at the pie timber!" she cried to donald, calling his attention to a lawn almost covered with red-winged blackbirds. </s>
<s>  "four hundred and twenty might be baked in that pie," she laughed. </s>
<s>  then a subtle change began to creep over the world. </s>
<s>  the sun peered over the mountains inquiringly, a timid young thing, as if she were asking what degree of light and warmth they would like for the day. </s>
<s>  a new brilliancy tinged every flower face in this light, a throbbing ecstasy mellowed every bird note. </s>
<s>  the orchards dropped farther apart, meadows filled with grazing cattle flashed past them, the earthy scent of freshly turned fields mingled with flower perfume, and on their right came drifting in a cool salt breath from the sea. </s>
<s>  at mid-forenoon, as they neared laguna, they ran past great hills, untouched since the days when david cried: "i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. </s>
<s> " at one particularly beautiful range, draped with the flowing emerald of spring, decorated with beds of gold poppy, set with flowering madrona and manzanita, with the gold of yellow monkey flower or the rich red of the related species, with specimens of lupin growing in small trees, here and there adventurous streams singing and flashing their unexpected way to the mother breast of the waiting ocean very near to the road which at one surprising turn carried them to the never-ending wonder of the troubled sea, they drove as slowly as the bear cat would consent to travel, so that they might study great boulders, huge as many of the buildings they had passed, their faces scarred by the wrack of ages. </s>
<s>  studying their ancient records one could see that they had been familiar with the star that rested over bethlehem. </s>
<s>  on their faces had shone the same moon that opened the highways journeying into damascus. </s>
<s>  they had stood the storms that had beaten upon the world since the days when the floods subsided, the land lifted above the face of the waters in gigantic upheavals that had ripped the surface of the globe from north to south and forced up the hills, the foothills, and the mountains of the coast range. </s>
<s>  they had been born then, they had first seen the light of day, in glowing, molten, red-hot, high-piled streams of lava that had gushed forth in that awful evolution of birth. </s>
<s>  sometimes linda stopped the car, they left it, and climbed over the faces of these mighty upheavals. </s>
<s>  once linda reached her hand to donald and cried, half laughingly, half in tense earnest: "oh, kid, we have got to hurry. </s>
<s>  compared with the age of these, we've only a few minutes. </s>
<s>  it's all right to talk jestingly about 'the crack of doom' but you know there really was a crack of doom, and right here is where it cracked and spewed out the material that hardened into these very rocks. </s>
<s>  beside them i feel as a shrimp must feel beside a whale, and i feel that we must hurry. </s>
<s> " "and so we must," said donald. </s>
<s>  "i am hungry as likeliest when he waited for them to find enough peacock tongues to satisfy his appetite. </s>
<s> " "i wonder what brand of home-brew made him think of that," said linda. </s>
<s>  "well, you know," said donald, "the world was only a smallish place then. </s>
<s>  they didn't have to go far to find everything to which they had access, and it must have been rather a decent time in which to live. </s>
<s>  awful lot of light and color and music and unique entertainment. </s>
<s> " "you're talking," said linda, "from the standpoint of the king or the master. </s>
<s>  suppose you had lived then and had been the slave. </s>
<s> " "there you go again," said donald, "throwing a brick into the most delicate mechanism of my profound thought. </s>
<s>  you ought to be ashamed to round me up with something scientific and materialistic every time i go a-glimmering. </s>
<s>  don't you think this would be a fine place to have lunch?" "you wait and see where we lunch today, and you will have the answer to that," said linda, starting back to the bear cat. </s>
<s>  a few miles farther on they followed the road around the frowning menace of an overhanging rock and sped out directly to the panorama of the sea. </s>
<s>  the sun was shining on it,  as always round the laguna shore, the rip tide was working itself into undue fury. </s>
<s>  it came dashing up on the ancient rocks until one could easily understand why a poet of long ago wrote of sea horses. </s>
<s>  some of the waves did suggest monstrous white chargers racing madly to place their feet upon the solid rock. </s>
<s>  through the village, up the steep inclines, past placid lakes, past waving yellow mustard beds, beside highways where the breastplate of mother earth gleamed emerald and ruby against the background of billions of tiny, shining diamonds of the iceplant, past the old ostrich tree reproduced by etchers of note the world over, with grinding brakes, sliding down the breathless declivity leading to the shore, linda stopped at last where the rock walls lifted sheer almost to the sky. </s>
<s>  she led donald to a huge circle carpeted with cerise sand verbena, with pink and yellow iceplant bloom, with jewelled iceplant foliage, with the running blue of the lovely sea daisy, with the white and pink of the sea fig, where the walls were festooned with ferns, lichens, studded all over with flaming our lord's candles, and strange, uncanny, grotesque flower forms, almost human in their writhing turns as they twisted around the rocks and slipped along clinging to the sheer walls. </s>
<s>  just where the vegetation met the white, sea-washed s linda spread the indian blanket, and donald brought the lunch box. </s>
<s>  at their feet adventurous waves tore themselves to foam on the sharp rocks. </s>
<s>  on their left they broke in booming spray, tearing and fretting the base of cliffs that had stood impregnable through aeons of such ceaseless attack and repulse. </s>
<s>  "i wonder," said donald, "how it comes that i have lived all my life in california, and today it seems to me that most of the worthwhile things i know about her i owe to you. </s>
<s>  when i go to college this winter t. </s>
<s> he things i shall be telling the boys will be how i could gain a living, if i had to, on the desert, in death valley, from the walls of multiflores canyon. </s>
<s>  and how the waves go to smash on the rocks of laguna, not to mention cactus fish hooks, mescal sticks, and brigand beefsteak. </s>
<s>  it's no wonder the artists of all the world come here copying these pictures. </s>
<s>  it's no wonder they build these bungalows and live here for years, unsatisfied with their efforts to reproduce the pictures of the master painter of them all. </s>
<s> " "i wonder," said linda, "if anybody is very easily satisfied. </s>
<s>  i wonder today if eileen is satisfied with being merely rich. </s>
<s>  i wonder if we are satisfied to have this golden day together. </s>
<s>  i wonder if the white swallows are satisfied with the sea. </s>
<s>  i wonder if those rocks are satisfied and proud to stand impregnable against the constant torment of the tide. </s>
<s> " "i wonder, oh, lord, how i wonder," broke in donald, "about katherine o'donovan's lunch box. </s>
<s>  if you want a picture of per feet satisfaction, belinda beloved, lead me to it!" "thank heaven you're mistaken," she said. </s>
<s>  "they spared me the 'be'--. </s>
<s>  it's truly just 'linda. </s>
<s> "' "well, i am not sparing you the 'be--'," said donald, busy with the fastenings of the lunch basket. </s>
<s>  "did you hear where i used it?" "yes, child, and i like it heaps," said linda casually. </s>
<s>  "it's fine to have you like me. </s>
<s>  awfully proud of myself. </s>
<s> " "you have two members of our family at your feet," said donald soberly as he handed her packages from the box. </s>
<s>  "my dad is beginning to discourse on you with such signs of intelligence that i am almost led to believe, from some of his wildest outbursts, that he has had some personal experience in some way. </s>
<s> " "and why not?" asked linda lightly. </s>
<s>  "haven't i often told you that my father constantly went on fishing and hunting trips, that he was a great collector of botanical specimens, that he frequently took his friends with him? you might ask your father if he does not recall me as having fried fish and made coffee and rendered him camp service when i was a slip of a thing in the dawn of my teens. </s>
<s> " "well, he didn't just mention it," said donald, "but i can . </s>
<s> easily see how it might have been. </s>
<s> " after they had finished one of katy's inspired lunches, in which a large part of the inspiration had been mental on linda's part and executive on katy's, they climbed rock faces, skirted wave-beaten promontories, and stood peering from overhanging cliffs dipping down into the fathomless green sea, where the water boiled up in turbulent fury. </s>
<s>  linda pointed out the rocks upon which she would sit, if she were a mermaid, to comb the seaweed from her hair. </s>
<s>  she could hear the sea bells ringing in those menacing depths, but donald's ears were not so finely tuned. </s>
<s>  at the top of one of the highest cliffs they climbed, there grew a clump of slender pale green bushes, towering high above their heads with exquisitely cut blue-green leaves, lance shaped and slender. </s>
<s>  donald looked at the fascinating growth appraisingly. </s>
<s>  "linda," he said, "do you know that the slimness and the sheerness and the audacious foothold and the beauty of that thing remind me of you? it is covered all over with the delicate frostbloom you taught me to see upon fruit. </s>
<s>  i find it everywhere but you have never told me what it is. </s>
<s> " linda laughingly reached up and broke a spray of greenish-yellow tubular flowers, curving out like clustered trumpets spilling melody from their fluted throats. </s>
<s>  "you will see it everywhere. </s>
<s>  you will find these flowers every month of the year," she said, "and i am particularly gladsome that this plant reminds you of me. </s>
<s>  i love the bluish-green 'bloom' of its sheer foliage. </s>
<s>  i love the music these flower trumpets make to me. </s>
<s>  i love the way it has traveled, god knows how, all the way from the argentine and spread itself over our country wherever it is allowed footing. </s>
<s>  i am glad that there is soothing in these dried leaves for those who require it. </s>
<s>  i shall be delighted to set my seal on you with it. </s>

<s> " "well, i have a halting vocabulary," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "what's your phrase?" "linda put this flower on me today," said donald, "and she said she was pleased because i said the tall, slender bush it grew on reminded me of her. </s>
<s>  she gave me the spanish name, but i don't know the exact significance of the decoration i am wearing until i learn the meaning of the phrase. </s>

<s>  and that may seem a queer thing for me to say when you know that i am getting the joy in my life, that i do not hesitate to admit i am, from letters written by a man whose name i don't know. </s>
<s>  it may be that i don't know the man, but i certainly am very well acquainted with him, and in some way he seems to me to be taking on more definite form. </s>
<s>  i should not be surprised if i were to recognize him the first time i met him face to face. </s>
<s>  linda looked through the skylight and cried out to the stars: "good heavens! have i copied peter too closely?" she sat thinking a minute and then she decided she had not. </s>
<s>  and in this connection you will want to know how i am progressing in my friendship with the junior partner, and what kind of motorist i am making. </s>
<s>  i am still driving twice a week, and lately on sundays in a larger car, taking dana and a newspaper friend of hers along. </s>
<s>  i think i have driven every hazard that this part of california affords except the mountains. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  snow is still merciful about them. </s>
<s>  linda dear, i know what you're dying to know. </s>
<s>  you want to know whether mr. </s>
<s>  snow is in the same depths of mourning as when our acquaintance first began. </s>
<s>  this, my dear child, is very reprehensible of you. </s>
<s>  young girls with braids down their backs--and by the way, linda, you did not tell me what happened "after the ball was over. </s>
<s> " did you go to school the next morning with braids down your back, or wearing your coronet? because on that depends what i have to say to you now. </s>
<s>  if you went with braids, you're still my little girl chum, the cleanest, finest kid i have ever known. </s>
<s>  but if you wore your coronet, then you're a woman and my equal and my dearest friend, far dearer than dana even. </s>
<s>  and i tell you this, linda, because i want you always to understand that you come first. </s>
<s>  i have tried and tried to visualize you, and can't satisfy my mind as to whether the braids are up or down. </s>
<s>  going on the assumption that they are up, and that life may in the near future begin to hold some interesting experiences for you, i will tell you this, beloved child: i don't think mr. </s>
<s>  snow is mourning quite so deeply as he was. </s>
<s>  i have not been asked, the last four or five trips we have been on, to carry an armload of exquisite flowers to the shrine of a departed love. </s>
<s>  i have been privileged to take them home and arrange them in my room and dana's. </s>
<s>  and i haven't heard so much talk about loneliness, and i haven't seen such tired, sad eyes. </s>
<s>  it seems to me that a familiar pair of shoulders are squaring up to the world again, and a very kind pair of eyes are brighter with interest. </s>
<s>  i don't know how you feel about this. </s>
<s>  i don't know how i feel about it myself. </s>
<s>  i am sure that eugene snow is a man who, in the years to come, would line up beside your father and mine, and i like him immensely. </s>
<s>  it is merely a case of not liking him less, but of liking my unknown man more. </s>
<s>  i couldn't quite commit the sacrilege, linda dear, of sending you a sample of the letters i am receiving, but they are too fanciful and charming for any words of mine to describe adequately. </s>
<s>  i don't know who this man is, or what he has to offer, or whether he intends to offer anything, but it is a ridiculous fact, linda, that i would rather sit with him in a chimney corner of field boulders, on a pine floor, with a palm roof and an ocotillo candle, than to glow in the parchment-shielded electric light of the halls of a rich man. </s>
<s>  in a recent letter, linda, there was a reference to a woman who wore "a diadem of crystallized light. </s>
<s> " it was a beautiful thing and i could not help taking it personally. </s>
<s>  it was his way of telling me that he knew me, and knew my tragedy. </s>
<s>   as i said before, i am beginning to feel that i have him rather definitely located. </s>
<s>  and i can understand the fine strain in him that prompted his anonymity, and his reasons for it. </s>
<s>  of course i am not sufficiently confident yet to say anything definite, but my heart is beginning to say things that i sincerely hope my lips never will be forced to deny. </s>
<s>  linda laid down the letter, folded her hands across it, and once more looked at the stars. </s>
<s>  "good gracious!" she said. </s>
<s>  "i am tincturing those letters with too much peter. </s>
<s>  i'll have to tone down a bit. </s>
<s>  next thing i know she will be losing her chance with that wonderful snow man for a dream. </s>
<s>  in my efforts to comfort her i must have gone too far. </s>
<s>  it is all right to write a gushy love letter and stuff it full of peter's whimsical nonsense,  in the language of the poet, how am i going to 'deliver the goods'? of course that talk about louise whiting was all well enough. </s>
<s>  equally, of course, i outlined and planted the brook and designed the bridge for marian, whether she knows it or peter knows it, or not. </s>
<s>  if they don't know it, it's about time they were finding it out. </s>
<s>  i think it's my job to visit peter more frequently and see if i can't invent some way to make him see the light. </s>
<s>  i will give katy a hint in the morning. </s>
<s>  tomorrow evening i'll go up and have supper with him and see if he has another article in the stewpan. </s>
<s>  i like this work with peter. </s>
<s>  i like having him make me dream dreams and see pictures. </s>
<s>  i like the punch and the virility he puts into my drawings. </s>
<s>  it's all right reproducing monkey flowers and lilies for pastime, but for serious business, for real life work, i would rather do peter's brainstorming, heart-thrilling pictures than my merely pretty ones. </s>
<s>  on the subject of peter, i must remember in the morning to take those old books he gave me to donald. </s>
<s>  i believe that from one of them he is going to get the very material he needs to down the jap in philosophy. </s>
<s>  and they are not text books which proves that peter must have been digging into the subject and hunted them up in some second-hand store, or even sent away an order for them. </s>
<s> " in the hall the next morning linda stopped donald and gave him the books. </s>
<s>  in the early stages of their friendship she had looked at him under half-closed lids and waited to see whether he intended stopping to say a word with her when they passed each other or came down the halls together. </s>
<s>  she knew that their acquaintance would be noted and commented upon, and she knew how ready the other girls would be to say that she was bold and forward, so she was careful to let donald make the advances, until he had called to her so often, and had dug flowers and left his friends waiting at her door while he delivered them, that she felt free to address him as she chose. </s>
<s>  he had shown any interested person in the high school that he was her friend, that he was speaking to her exactly as he did to girls he had known from childhood. </s>
<s>  he was very popular among the boys and girls of his class and the whole school. </s>
<s>  his friendship, coming at the time of linda's rebellion on the subject of clothes, had developed a tendency to bring her other friendships. </s>
<s>  boys who never had known she was in existence followed donald's example in stopping her to say a word now and then. </s>
<s>  girls who had politely ignored her now found things to say. </s>
<s>  and several invitations she had not had leisure to accept had been sent to her for afternoon and evening entertainments among the young people. </s>
<s>  linda had laid out for herself something of a task in deciding to be the mental leader of her class. </s>
<s>  there were good brains in plenty among the other pupils. </s>
<s>  it was only by work, concentration, and purpose, only by having a mind keenly alert, by independent investigation and introducing new points of view that she could hold her prestige. </s>
<s>  up to the receipt of her letter containing the offer to publish her book she had been able rigorously to exclude from her mind the personality and the undertakings of jane meredith. </s>
<s>  she was linda strong in the high school and for an hour or two at her studies. </s>
<s>  she was jane meredith over the desert, through the canyons, beside the sea, in her multiflores kitchen or in katherine o'donovan's. </s>
<s>  but this book offer opened a new train of thought, a new series of plans. </s>
<s>  she could see her way-- thanks to her father she had the material in her mind and the art in her finger tips-- to materialize what she felt would be even more attractive in book form than anything her editor had been able to visualize from her material. </s>
<s>  she knew herself, she knew her territory so minutely. </s>
<s>  frequently she smiled when she read statements in her botanies as to where plants and vegetables could be found. </s>
<s>  she knew the high home of the rare and precious snow plant. </s>
<s>  she knew the northern limit of the strawberry cactus. </s>
<s>  she knew where the white sea swallow nested. </s>
<s>  she knew where the monarch butterfly went on his winter migration. </s>
<s>  she knew where the trap-door spider, with cunning past the cunning of any other architect of nature, built his small, round, silken-lined tower and hinged his trap door so cleverly that only he could open it from the outside. </s>
<s>  she had even sat immovable and watched him erect his house, and she would have given much to see him weave its silver lining. </s>
<s>  linda was fast coming to the place where she felt herself to be one in an interested group of fellow workers. </s>
<s>  she no longer gave a thought to what kind of shoes she wore. </s>
<s>  other girls were beginning to wear the same kind. </s>
<s>  the legislatures of half a dozen states were passing laws regulating the height of heel which might be worn within their boundaries. </s>
<s>  manufacturers were promising for the coming season that suitable shoes would be built for street wear and mountain climbing, for the sands of the sea and the sands of the desert, and the sheer face of canyons. </s>
<s>  the extremely long, dirt-sweeping skirts were coming up. </s>
<s>  the extremely short, immodest skirts were coming down. </s>
<s>  a sane and sensible wave seemed to be sweeping the whole country. </s>
<s>  under the impetus of donald whiting's struggles to lead his classes and those of other pupils to lead theirs a higher grade of scholarship was beginning to be developed throughout the high school. </s>
<s>  pupils were thinking less of what they wore and how much amusement they could crowd in, and more about making grades that would pass them with credit from year to year. </s>
<s>  the horrors of the war and the disorders following it had begun to impress upon the young brains growing into maturity the idea that soon it would be their task to take over the problems that were now vexing the world's greatest statesmen and its wisest and most courageous women. </s>
<s>  a tendency was manifesting itself among young people to equip themselves to take a worthy part in the struggles yet to come. </s>
<s>  classmates who had looked with toleration upon linda's common-sense shoes and plain dresses because she was her father's daughter, now looked upon her with respect and appreciation because she started so many interesting subjects for discussion, because she was so rapidly developing into a creature well worth looking at. </s>
<s>  always she would be unusual because of her extreme height, her narrow eyes, her vivid coloring. </s>
<s>  but a greater maturity, a fuller figure, had come to be a part of the vision with which one looked at linda. </s>
<s>  in these days no one saw her as she was. </s>
<s>  even her schoolmates had fallen into the habit of seeing her as she would be in the years to come. </s>
<s>  thus far she had been able to keep her identities apart without any difficulty. </s>
<s>  but the book proposition was so unexpected, it was such a big thing to result from her modest beginning, that linda realized that she must proceed very carefully, she must concentrate with all her might, else her school work would begin to suffer in favor of the book. </s>
<s>  recently so many things had arisen to distract her attention. </s>
<s>  many days she had not been able to keep eileen's face off her geometry papers. </s>
<s>  and again she saw gilman's, anxious and pain-filled. </s>
<s>  sometimes she found herself lifting her eyes from tasks upon which she was concentrating with all her might, and with no previous thought whatever she was searching for donald whiting, and when she saw him, coming into muscular and healthful manhood, she returned to her work with more strength, deeper vision, a quiet, assured feeling around her heart. </s>
<s>  sometimes, over the edge of literature and ancient history, peter morrison looked down at her with gravely questioning eyes and dancing imps twisting his mouth muscles, and linda paused a second to figure upon what had become an old problem with her. </s>
<s>  why did her wild-flower garden make peter morrison think of a graveyard? what was buried there besides the feet of her rare flowers? she had not as yet found the answer. </s>
<s>  this day her thoughts were on peter frequently because she intended to see him that night. </s>
<s>  she was going to share with him a supper of baked ham and beans and bread and butter and pickled onions and little nut cakes, still warm from katy's oven. </s>
<s>  she was going to take katy with her in order that she might see peter morrison's location and the house for his dream lady, growing at the foot of the mountain like a gay orchid homing on a forest tree. </s>
<s>  to linda it was almost a miracle, the rapidity with which a house could be erected in california. </s>
<s>  in a few weeks' time she had seen a big cellar scooped out of the plateau, had seen it lined and rising to foundation height above the surface in solid concrete, faced outside with cracked boulders. </s>
<s>  she had seen a framework erected, a rooftree set, and joists and rafters and beams swinging into place. </s>
<s>  fretworks of lead and iron pipe were running everywhere, and wires for electricity. </s>
<s>  soon shingles and flooring would be going into place, and peter said that when he had finished acrobatic performances on beams and girders and really stepped out on solid floors where he might tread without fear of breaking any of his legs, he would perform a peacock dance all by himself. </s>
<s>  "peter, you sound like a centipede," said linda. </s>
<s>  "dear child," said peter, "when i enter my front door and get to the back on two-inch footing, i positively feel that i have numerous legs, and i ache almost as badly in the fear that i shall break the two i have, as i should if they were really broken. </s>
<s> " and then he added a few words on a subject of which he had not before spoken to linda. </s>
<s>  "it was like that in france. </s>
<s>  when we really got into the heat of things and the work was actually being done, we were not afraid: we were too busy. </s>
<s>  we were 'supermen. </s>
<s> ' the time when we were all legs and arms and head, and all of them were being blown away wholesale was when the shells whined over while we had a rest hour and were trying to sleep, or in the cold, dim dawn when we stumbled out stiff, hungry, and sleepy. </s>
<s>  it's not the real thing when it's really occurring that gets one. </s>
<s>  it's the devils of imagination tormenting the soul. </s>
<s>  there is only one thing in this world can happen to me that is really going to be as bad as the things i dream. </s>
<s> " linda looked down lilac valley, her eyes absently focusing on katy busily setting supper on a store box in front of the garage. </s>
<s>  then she looked at peter. </s>
<s>  "mind telling?" she inquired lightly. </s>
<s>  peter looked at her speculatively. </s>
<s>  "and would a man be telling his heart's best secret to a kid like you?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "now, i call that downright mean," said linda. </s>
<s>  "haven't you noticed that my braids are up? don't you see a maturity and a dignity and a general matronliness apparent all over me today?" "matronliness" was too much for peter. </s>
<s>  you could have heard his laugh far down the blue valley. </s>
<s>  "that's good!" he cried. </s>
<s>  "it is," agreed linda. </s>
<s>  "it means that my braids are up to stay, so hereafter i am a real woman. </s>
<s> " she lingered over the word an instant, glancing whimsically at peter, a trace of a smile on her lips, then she made her way down a slant declivity and presently returned with an entire flower plant, new to peter and of unusual beauty. </s>
<s>  "and because i am a woman i shall set my seal upon you," she said. </s>
<s>  in the buttonhole of his light linen coat she placed a flower of satin face of purest gold, the five petals rounded, but sharply tipped, a heavy mass of silk stamens, pollen dusted in the heart. </s>
<s>  she pushed back the left side of his coat and taking one of the rough, hairy leaves of the plant she located it over peter's heart, her slim, deft fingers patting down the leaf and flattening it out until it lay pasted smooth and tight. </s>
<s>  as she worked, she smiled at him challengingly. </s>
<s>  peter knew he was experiencing a ceremony of some kind, the significance of which he must learn. </s>
<s>  it was the first time linda had voluntarily touched him. </s>
<s>  he breathed lightly and held steady, lest he startle her. </s>
<s>  "lovely enough," he said, "to have come from the hills of the stars. </s>
<s>  don't make me wait, linda. </s>
<s>  help me to the interpretation. </s>
<s> " "buena mujer," suggested linda. </s>
<s>  "good woman," translated peter. </s>
<s>  linda nodded, running a finger down the leaf over his heart. </s>
<s>  "because she sticks close to you," she explained. </s>
<s>  then startled by the look in peter's eyes, she cried in swift change: "now we are all going to work for a minute. </s>
<s>  katy's spreading the lunch. </s>
<s>  you take this pail and go to the spring for water and i shall tidy your quarters for you. </s>
<s> " with the eye of experience linda glanced over the garage deciding that she must ask for clean sheets for the cot and that the salvation army would like the heap of papers. </s>
<s>  studying the writing table she heard a faint sound that untrained ears would have missed. </s>
<s>  "ah, ha, ma wood mouse," said linda, "nibbling peter's dr, goods are you?" her cry a minute later answered the question. </s>
<s>  she came from the garage upon katherine o'donovan rushing to meet her, holding a man's coat at the length of her far-reaching arm. </s>
<s>  "i wish you'd look at that pocket. </s>
<s>  i don't know how long this coat has been hanging there, but there is a nest of field mice in it," she said. </s>
<s>  katy promptly retreated to the improvised dining table, seated herself upon an end of it, and raised both feet straight into the air. </s>
<s>  "small help i'll be getting from you," said linda laughingly. </s>
<s>  she went to the edge of the declivity that cut back to the garage and with a quick movement reversed the coat catching it by the skirts and shaking it vigorously. </s>
<s>  chapter xxvii. </s>
<s>  the straight and narrow this served exactly the purpose linda had intended. </s>
<s>  it dislodged the mouse nest and dropped it three feet below her level, but it did something else upon which linda had no time to count. </s>
<s>  it emptied every pocket in the coat and sent the contents scattering down the rough declivity. </s>
<s>  "oh my gracious!" gasped linda. </s>
<s>  "look what i have done! katy, come help me quickly. </s>
<s>  i have to gather up this stuff. </s>
<s>  but it's no use. </s>
<s>  i'll have to take it to peter and tell him. </s>
<s>  i couldn't put these things back in the pockets where his hand will reach for them, because i don't know which came from inside and which came from out. </s>
<s> " linda sprang down and began hastily gathering up everything she could see that had fallen from the coat pockets. </s>
<s>  she had almost finished when her fingers chanced upon a very soiled, befigured piece of paper whose impressed folds showed that it had been carried for some time in an inner pocket. </s>
<s>  as her fingers touched this paper her eyes narrowed, her breath came in a gasp. </s>
<s>  she looked at it a second, irresolute, then she glanced over the top of the declivity in the direction peter had taken. </s>
<s>  he was standing in front of the building, discussing some matter with the contractor. </s>
<s>  he had not yet gone to the spring. </s>
<s>  shielded by the embankment with shaking fingers linda opened the paper barely enough to see that it was marian's lost sheet of plans. </s>
<s>  but it was not as marian had lost it. </s>
<s>  it was scored deeply here and there with heavy lines suggestive of alterations, and the margin was fairly covered with fine figuring. </s>
<s>  linda did not know peter morrison's writing or figures. </s>
<s>  his articles had been typewritten and she had never seen his handwriting. </s>
<s>  she sat down suddenly on account of weakened knees, and gazed unseeingly down the length of lilac valley, her heart sick, her brain tormented. </s>
<s>  suddenly she turned and studied the house. </s>
<s>  "before the lord!" she gasped. </s>
<s>  "i thought there was something mighty familiar even about the skeleton of you! oh, peter, peter, where did you get this, and how could you do it?" for a while a mist blurred her eyes. </s>
<s>  she reached for the coat and started to replace the things she had gathered up, then she shut her lips tight. </s>
<s>  "best time to pull a tooth," she said tersely to a terra cotta red manzanita bush, "is when it aches. </s>
<s> " when peter returned from the spring he was faced by a trembling girl, colorless and trying hard to keep her voice steady. </s>
<s>  she held out the coat to him with one h the package of papers with the other, the folded drawing conspicuous on the top. </s>
<s>  with these she gestured toward the declivity. </s>
<s>  "mouse nest in your pocket, peter," she said thickly. </s>
<s>  "reversed the coat to shake it out, and spilled your stuff. </s>
<s> " then she waited for peter to be confounded. </s>
<s>  but peter was not in the faintest degree troubled about either the coat or the papers. </s>
<s>  what did trouble him was the face and the blazing eyes of the girl concerning whom he would not admit, even to himself, his exact state of feeling. </s>
<s>  "the mouse did not get on you, linda?" he asked anxiously. </s>
<s>  linda shook her head. </s>
<s>  suddenly she lost her self-control. </s>
<s>  "oh, peter," she wailed, "how could you do it?" peter's lean frame tensed suddenly. </s>
<s>  "i don't underst linda," he said quietly. </s>
<s>  "exactly what have i done?" linda thrust the coat and the papers toward him accusingly and stood there wordless but with visible pain in her dark eyes. </s>
<s>  peter smiled at her reassuringly. </s>
<s>  "that's not my coat, you know. </s>
<s>  if there is anything distressing about it, don't lay it to me. </s>
<s> " "oh, peter!" cried linda, "tell the truth about it. </s>
<s>  don't try any evasions. </s>
<s>  i am so sick of them. </s>
<s> " a rather queer light sprang into peter's eyes. </s>
<s>  he leaned forward suddenly and caught the coat from linda's fingers. </s>
<s>  "well, if you need an alibi concerning this coat," he said, "i think i can furnish it speedily. </s>
<s> " as he talked he whirled the garment around and shot his long arms into the sleeves. </s>
<s>  shaking it into place on his shoulders, he slowly turned in front of linda and the surprised katy. </s>
<s>  the sleeves came halfway to his wrists and the shoulders slid down over his upper arms. </s>
<s>  he made such a quaint and ridiculous figure that katy burst out laughing. </s>
<s>  she was very well trained, but she knew linda was deeply distressed. </s>
<s>  "wake up, lambie!" she cried sharply. </s>
<s>  "that coat ain't belonging to mr. </s>
<s>  pater morrison. </s>
<s>  that gairment is the property of that bug-catchin' architect of his. </s>
<s> " peter shook off the coat and handed it back to linda. </s>
<s>  "am i acquitted?" he asked lightly. </s>
<s>  but his surprised eyes were searching her from braid to toe. </s>
<s>  linda turned from him swiftly. </s>
<s>  she thrust the packet into a side pocket and started to the garage with the coat. </s>
<s>  as she passed inside she slipped down her h slid the sheet of plans from the other papers, and slipped it into the front of her blouse. </s>
<s>  she hung the coat back where she had found it, then suddenly sat down on the side of peter morrison's couch, white and shaken. </s>
<s>  peter thought he heard a peculiar gasp and when he strayed past the door, casually glancing inward, he saw what he saw, and it brought him to his knees beside linda with all speed. </s>
<s>  "linda-girl," he implored, "what in this world has happened?" linda struggled to control her voice. </s>
<s>  but at last she buried her face in her hands and frankly emitted a sound that she herself would have described as "howling. </s>
<s> " peter knelt back in wonder. </s>
<s>  "of all the things i ever thought about you, linda," he said, "the one thing i never did think was that you were hysterical. </s>
<s> " if there was one word in linda's vocabulary more opprobrious than "nerves," which could be applied to a woman, it was "hysterics. </s>
<s> " the great specialist had admitted nerves. </s>
<s>  hysterics had no standing with him. </s>
<s>  linda herself had no more use for a hysterical woman than she had for a gila monster. </s>
<s>  she straightened suddenly, and in removing her hands from her face she laid one on each of peter's shoulders. </s>
<s>  "oh, peter," she wailed, "i am not a hysterical idiot, but i couldn't have stood it if that coat had been yours. </s>
<s>  peter, i just couldn't have borne it!" peter held himself rigidly in the fear that he might disturb the hands that were gripping him. </s>
<s>  "i see i have the job of educating these damned field mice as to where they may build with impunity," he said soberly. </s>
<s>  but linda was not to be diverted. </s>
<s>  she looked straight and deep into his eyes. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said affirmatively, "you don't know a thing about that coat, do you?" "i do not," said peter promptly. </s>
<s>  "you never saw what was in its pockets, did you?" "not to my knowledge," answered peter. </s>
<s>  "what was in the pockets, linda?" linda thought swiftly. </s>
<s>  peter adored his dream house. </s>
<s>  if she told him that the plans for it had been stolen by his architect, the house would be ruined for peter. </s>
<s>  anyone could see from the candor of his gaze and the lines that god and experience had graven on his face that peter was without guile. </s>
<s>  suddenly linda shot her hands past peter's shoulders and brought them together on the back of his neck. </s>
<s>  she drew his face against hers and cried: "oh peter, i would have been killed if that coat had been yours. </s>
<s>  i tell you i couldn't have endured it, peter. </s>
<s>  i am just tickled to death!" one instant she hugged him tight. </s>
<s>  if her lips did not brush his cheek, peter deluded himself. </s>
<s>  then she sprang up and ran from the garage. </s>
<s>  later he took the coat from its nail, the papers from its pockets, and carefully looked them over. </s>
<s>  there was nothing among them that would give him the slightest clue to linda's conduct. </s>
<s>  he looked again, penetratingly, searchingly, for he must learn from them a reason. </s>
<s>  and no reason was apparent. </s>
<s>  with the coat in one hand and the papers in the other he stepped outside. </s>
<s>  "linda," he said, "won't you show me? won't you tell me? what is there about this to upset you?" linda closed her lips and shook her head. </s>
<s>  once more peter sought in her face, in her attitude the information he craved. </s>
<s>  "needn't tell me," he said, "that a girl who will face the desert and the mountains and the canyons and the sea is upset by a mouse. </s>
<s> " "well, you should have seen katy sitting in the midst of our supper with her feet rigidly extended before her!" cried the girl, struggling to regain her composure. </s>
<s>  "put back that coat and come to your supper. </s>
<s>  it's time for you to be fed now. </s>
<s>  the last workman has gone and we'll barely have time to finish nicely and show katy your dream house before it's time to go. </s>
<s> " peter came and sat in the place linda indicated. </s>
<s>  his mind was whirling. </s>
<s>  there was something he did not underst but in her own time, in her own way, a girl of linda's poise and self-possession would tell him what had occurred that could be responsible for the very peculiar things she had done. </s>
<s>  in some way she had experienced a shock too great for her usual self-possession. </s>
<s>  the hands with which she fished pickled onions from the bottle were still unsteady, and the corroboration peter needed for his thoughts could be found in the dazed way in which katy watched linda as she hovered over her in serving her. </s>
<s>  but that was not the time. </s>
<s>  by and by the time would come. </s>
<s>  the thing to do was to trust linda and await its coming. </s>
<s>  so peter called on all the reserve wit and wisdom he had at command. </s>
<s>  he jested, told stories, and to linda's satisfaction and katy's delight, he ate his supper like a hungry man, frankly enjoying it, and when the meal was finished peter took katy over the house, explaining to her as much detail as was possible at that stage of its construction, while linda followed with mute lips and rebellion surging in her heart. </s>
<s>  when leaving time came, while katy packed the bear cat, linda wandered across toward the spring, and peter, feeling that possibly she might wish to speak with him, followed her. </s>
<s>  when he overtook her she looked at him straightly, her eyes showing the hurt her heart felt. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said, "that first night you had dinner with us, was henry anderson out of your presence one minute from the time you came into the house until you left it?" peter stopped and studied the ground at his feet intently. </s>
<s>  finally he said conclusively: "i would go on oath, linda, that he was not. </s>
<s>  we were all together in the living room, all together in the dining room. </s>
<s>  we left together at night and john was with us. </s>
<s> " "i see," said linda. </s>
<s>  "well, then, when you came back the next morning after eileen, before you started on your trip, to hunt a location, was he with you all the time?" again peter took his time to answer. </s>
<s>  "we came to your house with gilman," he said. </s>
<s>  "john started to the front door to tell miss eileen that we were ready. </s>
<s>  i followed him. </s>
<s>  anderson said he would look at the scenery. </s>
<s>  he must have made a circuit of the house, because when we came out ready to start, a very few minutes later, he was coming down the other side of the house. </s>
<s> " "ah," said linda comprehendingly. </s>
<s>  "linda," said peter quietly, "it is very obvious that something has worried you extremely. </s>
<s>  am i in any way connected with it?" linda shook her head. </s>
<s>  "is there anything i can do?" the negative was repeated. </s>
<s>  then she looked at him. </s>
<s>  "no, peter," she said quietly, "i confess i have had a shock, but it is in no way connected with you and there is nothing you can do about it but forget my foolishness. </s>
<s>  but i am glad--peter, you will never know how glad i am--that you haven't anything to do with it. </s>
<s> " then in the friendliest fashion imaginable she reached him her hand and led the way back to the bear cat, their tightly gripped hands swinging between them. </s>
<s>  as peter closed the door he looked down on linda. </s>
<s>  "young woman," he said, "since this country has as yet no nerve specialist to take the place of your distinguished father, if you have any waves to wave to me tonight, kindly do it before you start or after you reach the highway. </s>
<s>  if you take your hands off that steering wheel as you round the boulders and strike that declivity as i have seen you do heretofore, i won't guarantee that i shall not require a specialist myself. </s>
<s> " linda started to laugh, then she saw peter's eyes and something in them stopped her suddenly. </s>
<s>  "i did not realize that i was taking any risk," she said. </s>
<s>  "i won't do it again. </s>
<s>  i will say good-bye to you right here and now so i needn't look back. </s>
<s> " so she shook hands with peter and drove away. </s>
<s>  peter slowly followed down the rough driveway, worn hard by the wheels of delivery trucks, and stood upon the highest point of the rocky turn, looking after the small gray car as it slid down the steep declivity. </s>
<s>  and he wondered if there could have been telepathy in the longing with which he watched it go, for at the level roadway that followed between the cultivated land out to the highway linda stopped the car, stood up in it, and turning, looked back straight to the spot upon which peter stood. </s>
<s>  she waved both hands to him, and then gracefully and beautifully, with outstretched, fluttering fingers she made him the sign of birds flying home. </s>
<s>  and with the whimsy in his soul uppermost, peter reflected, as he turned back for a microscopic examination of henry anderson's coat and the contents of its pockets, that there was one bird above all others which made him think of linda. </s>
<s>  but he could not at the moment feather katherine o'donovan. </s>
<s>  and then he further reflected as he climbed the hill that if it had to be done the best he could do would be a bantam hen contemplating domesticity. </s>
<s>   linda looked the garage over very carefully when she put away the bear cat. </s>
<s>  when she closed the garage doors she was particular about the locks. </s>
<s>  as she came through the kitchen she said to katy, busy with the lunch box: "belovedest, have there been any strange japs poking around here lately?" she nearly collapsed when katy answered promptly: "a dale too many of the square-headed haythens. </s>
<s>  i am pestered to death with them. </s>
<s>  they used to come jist to water the lawn but now they want to crane the rugs. </s>
<s>  they want to do the wash. </s>
<s>  they are willing to crane house. </s>
<s>  they want to get into the garage. </s>
<s>  they insist on washing the car. </s>
<s>  if they can't wash it they jist want to see if it nades washin'. </s>
<s> " linda stood amazed. </s>
<s>  "and how long has this been going on, katy?" she finally asked. </s>
<s>  "well, i have had two good months of it," said katy. </s>
<s>  "that is, it started two months ago. </s>
<s>  the past month has been workin' up and the last ten days it seemed to me they was a jap on the back steps oftener than they was a stray cat, and i ain't no truck with ayther of them. </s>
<s>  they give me jist about the same falin'. </s>
<s>  between the two i would trust the cat a dale further with my bird than i would the jap. </s>
<s> " "have you ever unlocked the garage for them, katy?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  "no," said katy. </s>
<s>  "i only go there when i nade something about me work. </s>
<s> " "well, katy," said linda, "let me tell you this: the next time you go there for anything take a good look for japs before you open the door. </s>
<s>  get what you want and get out as quickly as possible and be sure, katy, desperately sure, that you lock the door securely when you leave. </s>
<s> " katy set her hands on her hips, flared her elbows, and lifted her chin. </s>
<s>  "what's any of them little haythen been coin' to scare ye, missy?" she demanded belligerently. </s>
<s>  "don't you think i am afraid of them! comes any of them around me and i'll take my mopstick over the heads of them. </s>
<s> " "and you'll break a perfectly good mopstick and not hurt the jap when you do it," said linda. </s>
<s>  "there's an undercurrent of something deep and subtle going on in this country right now, katy. </s>
<s>  when japan sends college professors to work in our kitchens and relatives of her greatest statesmen to serve our tables, you can depend on it she is not doing it for the money that is paid them. </s>
<s>  if california does not wake up very shortly and very thoroughly she is going to pay an awful price for the luxury she is experiencing while she pampers herself with the service of the japanese, just as the south has pampered herself for generations with the service of the negroes. </s>
<s>  when the negroes learn what there is to know, then the day of retribution will be at hand. </s>
<s>  and this is not croaking, katy. </s>
<s>  it is the truest gospel that was ever preached. </s>
<s>  keep your eyes wide open for japs. </s>
<s>  keep your doors locked, and if you see one prowling around the garage and don't know what he is after, go to the telephone and call the police. </s>
<s> " linda climbed the stairs to her workroom, plumped down at the table, set her chin in her palms, and lost herself in thought. </s>
<s>  for half an hour she sat immovable, staring at her caricature of eileen through narrowed lids. </s>
<s>  then she opened the typewriter, inserted a sheet and wrote: my dear mr. </s>
<s>  snow: i am writing as the most intimate woman friend of marian thorne. </s>
<s>  as such, i have spent much thought trying to figure out exactly the reason for the decision in your recent architectural competition. </s>
<s>  why a man should think of such a number of very personal, intimate touches that, from familiarity with them, i know that miss thorne had incorporated in her plans, and why his winning house should be her winning house, merely reversed. </s>
<s>  today i have found the answer, which i am forwarding to you, knowing that you will understand exactly what should be done. </s>
<s>  enclosed you will find one of the first rough s}. </s>
<s> etches marian made of her plans. </s>
<s>  in some mysterious manner it was lost on a night when your prize-winning architect had dinner at our house where miss thorne was also a guest. </s>
<s>  before retiring she showed to me and explained the plans with which she hoped to win your competition. </s>
<s>  in the morning i packed her suitcase and handed it to the porter of her train. </s>
<s>  when she arrived at san francisco she found that the enclosed sheet was missing. </s>
<s>  this afternoon tidying a garage in which mr. </s>
<s>  peter morrison, the author, is living while henry anderson completes a residence he is building for him near my home, i reversed a coat belonging to henry anderson to dislodge from its pocket the nest of a field mouse. </s>
<s>  in so doing i emptied all the pockets, and in gathering up their contents i found this lost sheet from marian's plans. </s>
<s>  i think nothing more need be said on my part save that i understood the winning plan was to become the property of nicholson and snow. </s>
<s>  without waiting to see whether these plans would win or not, henry anderson has them three fourths of the way materialized in mr. </s>
<s>  morrison's residence in lilac valley which is a northwestern suburb of los angeles. </s>
<s>  you probably have heard marian speak of me, and from her you may obtain any information you might care to have concerning my responsibility. </s>
<s>  i am mailing the sketch to you rather than to marian because i feel that you are the party most deeply interested in a business way, and i hope, too, that you will be interested in protecting my very dear friend from the disagreeable parts of this very disagreeable situation. </s>
<s>  very truly yours, linda strong. </s>
<s>  chapter xxviii. </s>
<s>  putting it up to peter when peter morrison finally gave up looking in the pockets of henry anderson's coat for enlightenment concerning linda's conduct, it was with his mind settled on one point. </s>
<s>  there was nothing in the coat now that could possibly have startled the girl or annoyed her. </s>
<s>  whatever had been there that caused her extremely peculiar conduct she had carried away with her. </s>
<s>  peter had settled convictions concerning linda. </s>
<s>  from the first instant he had looked into her clear young eyes as she stood in multiflores canyon triumphantly holding aloft the cotyledon in one hand and with the other struggling to induce the skirt of her blouse to resume its proper location beneath the band of her trousers, he had felt that her heart and her mind were as clear and cool and businesslike as the energetic mountain stream hurrying past her. </s>
<s>  above all others, "straight" was the one adjective he probably would have applied to her. </s>
<s>  whatever she had taken from henry's pockets was something that concerned her. </s>
<s>  if she took anything, she had a right to take it. </s>
<s>  of that peter was unalterably certain. </s>
<s>  he remembered that a few days before she practically had admitted to him that anderson had annoyed her, and a slow anger began to surge up in peter's carefully regulated heart. </s>
<s>  his thoughts were extremely busy, but the thing he thought most frequently and most forcefully was that he would thoroughly enjoy taking henry anderson by the scruff of the neck, leading him to the sheerest part of his own particular share of the mountain, and exhaustively booting him down it. </s>
<s>  "it takes these youngsters to rush in and raise the devil where there's no necessity for anything to happen if just a modicum of common sense had been used," growled peter. </s>
<s>  he mulled over the problem for several days, and then he decided he should see linda, and with his first look into her straight-forward eyes, from the tones of her voice and the carriage of her head he would know whether the annoyance persisted. </s>
<s>  about the customary time for her to return from school peter started on foot down the short cut between his home and the strong residence. </s>
<s>  he was following a footpath rounding the base of the mountain, crossing and recrossing the enthusiastic mountain stream as it speeded toward the valley, when a flash of color on the farther side of the brook attracted him. </s>
<s>  he stopped, then hastily sprang across the water, climbed a few yards,  after skirting a heavy clump of bushes, looked at linda sitting beside them--a most astonishing linda, appearing small and humble, very much tucked away, unrestrained tears rolling down her cheeks, a wet handkerchief wadded in one h a packet of letters in her lap. </s>
<s>  a long instant they studied each other. </s>
<s>  "am i intruding?" inquired peter at last. </s>
<s>  linda shook her head vigorously and gulped down a sob. </s>
<s>  "no, peter," she sobbed, "i had come this far on my way to you when my courage gave out. </s>
<s> " peter rearranged the immediate landscape and seated himself beside linda. </s>
<s>  "now stop distressing yourself," he said authoritatively. </s>
<s>  "you youngsters do take life so seriously. </s>
<s>  the only thing that could have happened to you worth your shedding a tear over can't possibly have happened. </s>
<s>  so stop this waste of good material. </s>
<s>  tears are very precious things, linda. </s>
<s>  they ought to be the most unusual things in life. </s>
<s>  now tell me something. </s>
<s>  were you coming to me about that matter that worried you the other evening?" linda shook her head. </s>
<s>  "no," she said, "i have turned that matter over where it belongs. </s>
<s>  i have nothing further to do with it. </s>
<s>  i'll confess to you i took a paper from among those that fell from henry anderson's pocket. </s>
<s>  it was not his. </s>
<s>  he had no right to have it. </s>
<s>  he couldn't possibly have come by it honorably or without knowing what it was. </s>
<s>  i took the liberty to put it where it belongs, or at least where it seemed to me that it belongs. </s>
<s>  that is all over. </s>
<s> " "then something else has happened?" asked peter. </s>
<s>  "something connected with the package of letters in your lap?" linda nodded vigorously. </s>
<s>  "peter, i have done something perfectly awful," she confessed. </s>
<s>  "i never in this world meant to do it. </s>
<s>  i wouldn't have done it for anything. </s>
<s>  i have got myself into the dreadfullest mess, and i don't know how to get out. </s>
<s>  when i couldn't stand it another minute i started right to you, peter, just like i would have started to my father if i would had him to go to. </s>
<s> " "i see," said peter, deeply interested in the toe of his shoe. </s>
<s>  "you depended on my age and worldly experience and my unconcealed devotion to your interests, which is exactly what you should do, my dear. </s>
<s>  now tell me. </s>
<s>  dry your eyes and tell me, and whatever it is i'll fix it all right and happily for you. </s>
<s>  i'll swear to do it if you want me to. </s>
<s> " then linda raised her eyes to his face. </s>
<s>  "oh, peter, you dear!" she cried. </s>
<s>  "peter, i'll just kneel and kiss your hands if you can fix this for me. </s>
<s> "  peter set his jaws and continued his meditations on shoe leather. </s>
<s>  "make it snappy!" he said tersely. </s>
<s>  "the sooner your troubles are out of your system the better you'll feel. </s>
<s>  whose letters are those, and why are you crying over them?" "oh, peter," quavered linda, "you know how i love marian. </s>
<s>  you have seen her and i have told you over and over. </s>
<s> " "yes," said peter soothingly, "i know. </s>
<s> " "i have told you how, after years of devotion to marian, john gilman let eileen make a perfect rag of him and tie him into any kind of knot she chose. </s>
<s>  peter, when marian left here she had lost everything on earth but a little dab of money. </s>
<s>  she had lost a father who was fine enough to be my father's best friend. </s>
<s>  she had lost a mother who was fine enough to rear marian to what she is. </s>
<s>  she had lost them in a horrible way that left her room for a million fancies and regrets: 'if i had done this,' or 'if i had done that,' or 'if i had taken another road. </s>
<s> ' and when she went away she knew definitely she had lost the first and only love of her heart. </s>
<s>  and i knew, because she was so sensitive and so fine, i knew, better than anybody living, how she could be hurt. </s>
<s>  and i thought if i could fix some scheme that would entertain her and take her mind off herself and make her feel appreciated only for a little while--i knew in all reason, peter, when she got out in the world where men would see her and see how beautiful and fine she is, there would be somebody who would want her quickly. </s>
<s>  all the time i have thought that when she came back, you would want her. </s>
<s>  peter, i fibbed when i said i was setting your brook for louise whiting. </s>
<s>  i was not. </s>
<s>  i don't know louise whiting. </s>
<s>  she is nothing to me. </s>
<s>  i was setting it for you and marian. </s>
<s>  it was a white head i saw among the iris marching down your creek bank, not a gold one, peter. </s>
<s> " peter licked his dry lips and found it impossible to look at linda. </s>
<s>  "straight ahead with it," he said gravely. </s>
<s>  "what did you do?" "oh, i have done the awfullest thing," wailed linda, "the most unforgivable thing!" she reached across and laid hold of the hand next her, and realizing that she needed it for strength and support, peter gave it into her keeping. </s>
<s>  "yes?" he questioned. </s>
<s>  "get on with it, linda. </s>
<s>  what was it you did?" "i had a typewriter: i could. </s>
<s>  i began writing her letters, the kind of letters that i thought would interest her and make her feel loved and appreciated. </s>
<s> " "you didn't sign my name to them, did you, linda?" asked peter in a dry, breathless voice. </s>
<s>  "no, peter," said linda, "i did not do that, i did worse. </s>
<s>  oh, i did a whole lot worse!" "i don't underst" said peter hoarsely. </s>
<s>  "i wanted to make them fine. </s>
<s>  i wanted to make them brilliant. </s>
<s>  i wanted to make them interesting. </s>
<s>  and of course i could not do it by myself. </s>
<s>  i am nothing but a copycat. </s>
<s>  i just quoted a lot of things i had heard you say. </s>
<s>  and i did worse than that, peter. </s>
<s>  i watched the little whimsy lines around your mouth and i tried to interpret the perfectly lovely things they would make you say to a woman if you loved her and were building a dream house for her. </s>
<s>  and oh, peter, it's too ghastly. </s>
<s>  i don't believe i can tell you. </s>
<s> " "this is pretty serious business, linda," said peter gravely. </s>
<s>  "having gone this far you are in honor bound to finish. </s>
<s>  it would not be fair to leave me with half a truth. </s>
<s>  what is the result of this impersonation?" "oh, peter," sobbed linda, breaking down again, "you're going to hate me. </s>
<s>  i know you're going to hate me and marian's going to hate me. </s>
<s>  and i didn't mean a thing but the kindest thing in all the world. </s>
<s> " "don't talk like that, linda," said peter. </s>
<s>  "if your friend is all you say she is, she is bound to understand. </s>
<s>  and as for me, i am not very likely to misjudge you. </s>
<s>  but be quick about it. </s>
<s>  what did you do, linda?" "why, i just wrote these letters that i am telling you about," said linda, "and i said the things that i thought would comfort her and entertain her and help with her work. </s>
<s>  and these are the answers that she wrote me, and i don't think i realized till last night that she was truly attributing them to any one man, truly believing in them. </s>
<s>  oh, peter, i wasn't asleep a minute all last night, and for the first time i failed in my lessons today. </s>
<s> " "and what is the culmination, linda?" urged peter. </s>
<s>   "she liked the letters, peter. </s>
<s>  they meant all i intended them to and they must have meant something i never could have imagined. </s>
<s>  and in san francisco one of the firm where she studies --a very fine man she says he is, peter. </s>
<s>  i can see that in every way he would be quite right for her. </s>
<s>  and i had a letter from her last night,  peter, he had asked her to marry him, to have a lifelong chance at work she is crazy about. </s>
<s>  he had offered her a beautiful home with everything that great wealth and culture and  good taste could afford. </s>
<s>  he had offered her the mothering of his little daughter. </s>
<s>  and she refused him, peter, refused him because she is in love, with all the love there is left in her disappointed, hurt heart, with the personality that these letters represent to her. </s>
<s>  and that personality is yours, peter. </s>
<s>  i stole it from you. </s>
<s>  i copied it into those letters. </s>
<s>  i am not straight. </s>
<s>  i am not fair. </s>
<s>  i wasn't honest with her. </s>
<s>  i wasn't honest with you. </s>
<s>  i'll just have to take off front the top of the highest mountain or sink in the deepest place in the sea, peter. </s>
<s>  i thought i was straight. </s>
<s>  i thought i was honorable i have made donald believe that i was. </s>
<s>  if i have to tell him the truth about this he won't want to wear my flower any more. </s>
<s>  i shall know all the things that marian has suffered, and a thousand times worse, because she was not to blame. </s>
<s>  she had nothing with which to reproach herself. </s>
<s> " peter put an arm across linda's shoulders and drew her up to him. </s>
<s>  for a long, bitter moment he thought deeply, and then he said hoarsely: "now calm down, linda. </s>
<s>  you're making an extremely high mountain out of an extremely shallow gopher hole. </s>
<s>  you haven't done anything irreparable. </s>
<s>  i see the whole situation. </s>
<s>  you are sure your friend has finally refused this offer she has had on account of these letters you have written?" suddenly linda relaxed. </s>
<s>  she leaned her warm young body against peter. </s>
<s>  she laid her tired head on his shoulder. </s>
<s>  she slipped the top letter of the packet in her lap from under its b opened it, and held it before him. </s>
<s>  peter read it very deliberately, then he nodded in acquiescence. </s>
<s>  "it's all too evident," he said quietly, "that you have taught her that there is a man in this world more to her liking than john gilman ever has been. </s>
<s>  when it came to materializing the man, linda, what was your idea? were you proposing to deliver me?" "i thought it would be suitable and you would be perfectly happy," sobbed linda, "and that way i could have both of you. </s>
<s> " "and donald also?" asked peter lightly. </s>
<s>  "donald of course," assented linda. </s>
<s>  and then she lifted her tear-spilling, wonderful eyes, wide open, to peter's, and demanded: " oh peter, i am so miserable i am almost dead. </s>
<s>  i have said you were a rock, and you are a rock. </s>
<s>  peter, can you get me out of this?" "sure," said peter grimly. </s>
<s>  "merely a case of living up to your blue china, even if it happens to be in the form of hieroglyphics instead of baked pottery. </s>
<s>  give me the letters, linda. </s>
<s>  give me a few days to study them. </s>
<s>  exchange typewriters with me so i can have the same machine. </s>
<s>  give me some of the paper on which you have been writing and the address you have been using, and i'll guarantee to get you out of this in some way that will leave you donald, and your friendship with marian quite as good as new. </s>
<s> " at that juncture peter might have been kissed, but his neck was very stiff and his head was very high and his eyes were on a far-distant hilltop from which at that minute he could not seem to gather any particular help. </s>
<s>  "would it be your idea," he said, "that by reading these letters i could gain sufficient knowledge of what has passed to go on with this?" "of course you could," said linda. </s>
<s>  peter reached in his side pocket and pulled out a clean handkerchief. </s>
<s>  he shook it from its folds and dried her eyes. </s>
<s>  then he took her by her shoulders and set her up straight. </s>
<s>  "now stop this nerve strain and this foolishness," he said tersely. </s>
<s>  "you have done a very wonderful thing for me. </s>
<s>  it is barely possible that marian thorne is not my dream woman, but we can't always have our dreams in this world, and if i could not have mine, truly and candidly, linda, so far as i have lived my life, i would rather have marian thorne than any other woman i have ever met. </s>
<s> " linda clapped her hands in delight. </s>
<s>  "oh, goody goody, peter!" she cried. </s>
<s>  "how joyous! can it be possible that my bungling is coming out right for marian and right for you?"  "and right for you, linda?" inquired peter lightly. </s>
<s>  "sure, right for me," said linda eagerly. </s>
<s>  "of course it's right for me when it's right for you and marian. </s>
<s>  and since it's not my secret alone i don't think it would be quite honorable to tell donald about it. </s>
<s>  what hurts marian's heart or heals it is none of his business. </s>
<s>  he doesn't even know her. </s>
<s> " "all right then, linda," said peter, rising, "give me the letters and bring me the machine and the paper. </s>
<s>  give me the joyous details and tell me when i am expected to send in my first letter in propria persona?', "oh, peter," cried linda, beaming on him, "oh, peter, you are a rock! i do put my trust in you. </s>
<s> " "then god help me," said peter, "for whatever happens, your trust in me shall not be betrayed, linda. </s>
<s> " chapter xxix. </s>
<s>  katy unburdens her mind possibly because she wished to eliminate herself from the offices of nicholson and snow for a few days, possibly because her finely attuned nature felt the call, marian thorne boarded a train that carried her to los angeles. </s>
<s>  she stepped from it at ten o'clock in the morning, and by the streetcar route made her way to lilac valley. </s>
<s>  when she arrived she realized that she could not see linda before, possibly, three in the afternoon. </s>
<s>  she entered a restaurant, had a small lunch box packed, and leaving her dressing case, she set off down the valley toward the mountains. </s>
<s>  she had need of their strength, their quiet and their healing. </s>
<s>  to the one particular spot where she had found comfort in lilac valley her feet led her. </s>
<s>  by paths of her own, much overgrown for want of recent usage, she passed through the cultivated fields, left the roadway, and began to climb. </s>
<s>  when she reached the stream flowing down the rugged hillside, she stopped to rest for a while, and her mind was in a tumult. </s>
<s>  in one minute she was seeing the bitterly disappointed face of a lonely, sensitive man whose first wound had been reopened by the making of another possibly quite as deep. </s>
<s>  and at the next her heart was throbbing because linda had succeeded in transferring the living peter to paper. </s>
<s>  the time had come when marian felt that she would know the personality embodied in the letters she had been receiving. </s>
<s>  and in the past few days her mind had been fixing tenaciously upon peter  morrison. </s>
<s>  and the feeling concerning which she had written linda had taken possession of her. </s>
<s>  wealth did not matter. </s>
<s>  position did not matter. </s>
<s>  losing the love of a good man did not matter but the mind and the heart and the personality behind the letters she had been receiving did matter. </s>
<s>  she thought long and seriously when at last she arose she had arrived at the conclusion that she had done the right thing, no matter whether the wonderful letters she had received went on and offered her love or not, no matter about anything. </s>
<s>  she must merely live and do the best she could, until the writer of those letters chose to disclose himself and say what purpose he had in mind when he wrote them. </s>
<s>  so marian followed her own path beside the creek until she neared its head, which was a big, gushing icy spring at the foot of the mountain keeping watch over the small plateau that in her heart she had thought of as hers for years. </s>
<s>  as she neared the location strange sounds began to reach her, voices of men, clanging of hammers, the rip of saws. </s>
<s>  a look of deep consternation overspread her face. </s>
<s>  she listened an instant and then began to run. </s>
<s>  when she broke through the rank foliage flourishing from the waters of the spring and looked out on the plateau what she saw was peter morrison's house in the process of being floored and shingled. </s>
<s>  for a minute marian was physically ill. </s>
<s>  her heart hurt until her hand crept to her side in an effort to soothe it. </s>
<s>  before she asked the question of a man coming to the spring with a pail in his h she knew the answer. </s>
<s>  it was peter morrison's house. </s>
<s>  marian sprang across the brook, climbed to the temporary roadway, and walked down in front of the building. </s>
<s>  she stood looking at it intently. </s>
<s>  it was in a rough stage, but much disguise is needed to prevent a mother from knowing her own child. </s>
<s>  marian's dark eyes began to widen and to blaze. </s>
<s>  she walked up to the front of the house and found that rough flooring had been laid so that she could go over the first floor. </s>
<s>  when she had done this she left the back door a deeply indignant woman. </s>
<s>  "there is some connection," she told herself tersely, "between my lost sketch and this house, which is merely a left-to-right rehearsal of my plans. </s>
<s>  and it's the same plan with which henry anderson won the nicholson and snow prize money and the still more valuable honor of being the prize winner. </s>
<s>  what i want to know is how such a wrong may be righted, and what peter morrison has to do with it. </s>
<s> " stepping from the back door, marian followed the well-worn pathway that led to the garage, looking right and left for peter, and she was wondering what she would say to him if she met him. </s>
<s>  she was thinking that perhaps she had better return to san francisco and talk the matter over with mr. </s>
<s>  snow before she said anything to anyone else. </s>
<s>  by this time she had reached the garage and stood in its wide-open door. </s>
<s>  she looked in at the cot, left just as someone had arisen from it, at the row of clothing hanging on a rough wooden rack at the back, at the piled boxes, at the big table, knocked together from rough lumber, in the center, scattered and piled with books and magazines. </s>
<s>  and then her eyes fixed intently on a packet lying on the table beside a typewriter and a stack of paper and envelopes. </s>
<s>  she walked over and picked up the packet. </s>
<s>  as she had known the instant she saw them, they were her letters. </s>
<s>  she stood an instant holding them in her h a dazed expression on her face. </s>
<s>  mechanically she reached out and laid her hands on the closed typewriter to steady herself. </s>
<s>  something about it appealed to her as familiar. </s>
<s>  she looked at it closely, then she lifted the cover and examined the machine. </s>
<s>  it was the same machine that had stood for years in doctor strong's library, a machine upon which she had typed business letters for her own father, and sometimes she had copied lectures and book manuscript on it for doctor strong. </s>
<s>  until his house was completed and his belongings arrived, peter undoubtedly had borrowed it. </s>
<s>  suddenly a wild desire to escape swept over marian. </s>
<s>  her first thought was of her feelings. </s>
<s>  she was angry, and justly so. </s>
<s>  in her heart she had begun to feel that the letters she was receiving were from peter morrison. </s>
<s>  here was the proof. </s>
<s>  could it be possible that in their one meeting peter had decided that she was his dream woman, that in some way he had secured that rough sketch of her plans, and from them was preparing her dream house for her? the thought sped through her brain that he was something more than human to have secured those plans, to have found that secluded and choice location. </s>
<s>  for an instant she forgot the loss of the competition in trying to comprehend the wonder of finding her own particular house fitting her own particular location as naturally as one of its big boulders. </s>
<s>  she tried to replace the package of letters exactly as she had found them. </s>
<s>  on tiptoe she slipped back to the door and looked searchingly down the road, around, and as far as possible through the house. </s>
<s>  then she gathered her skirts, stepped from the garage, and began the process of effacing herself on the mountain side from clump to clump of the thickest bushes, crouching below the sage and greasewood, pausing to rest behind lilac and elder, with. </s>
<s>  out regard for her traveling suit or her beautifully shod feet, marian fled from her location. </s>
<s>  when at last she felt that she was completely hidden and at least a mile from the spot, she dropped panting on a boulder, brushing the debris from her skirts, lifting trembling hands to straighten her hat, and ruefully contemplating her shoes. </s>
<s>  then she tried to think in a calm, dispassionate, and reasonable manner, but she found it a most difficult process. </s>
<s>  her mind was not well ordered, neither was it at her command. </s>
<s>  it whirled and shot off at unexpected tangents and danced as irresponsibly as a grasshopper from one place to another. </s>
<s>  the flying leaps it took ranged from san francisco to lilac valley, from her location upon which peter morrison was building her house, to linda. </s>
<s>  even john gilman obtruded himself once more. </s>
<s>  at one minute she was experiencing a raging indignation against henry anderson. </s>
<s>  how had he secured her plan? at another she was trying to figure dispassionately what connection peter morrison could have had with the building of his house upon her plan. </s>
<s>  every time peter came into the equation her heart arose in his defense. </s>
<s>  in some way his share in the proceeding was all right. </s>
<s>  he had cared for her and he had done what he thought would please her. </s>
<s>  therefore she must be pleased, although forced to admit to herself that she would have been infinitely more pleased to have built her own house in her own way. </s>
<s>  she was hungry to see linda. </s>
<s>  she wanted katherine o'donovan to feed her and fuss over her and entertain her with her mellow irish brogue. </s>
<s>  but if she went to them and disclosed her presence in the valley, peter would know about it, and if he intended the building he was erecting as a wonderful surprise for her, then she must not spoil his joy. </s>
<s>  plan in any way she could, marian could see no course left to her other than to slip back to the station and return to san francisco without meeting any of her friends. </s>
<s>  she hurriedly ate her lunch, again straightened her clothing, went to the restaurant for her traveling bag, and took the car for the station where she waited for a return train to san francisco she bought a paper and tried to concentrate upon it in an effort to take her mind from her own problems so that, when she returned to them, she would be better able to think clearly, to reason justly, to act wisely. </s>
<s>  she was very glad when her train came and she was started on her way northward. </s>
<s>  at the first siding upon which it stopped to allow the passing of a south-bound limited, she was certain that as the cars flashed by, in one of them she saw eugene snow. </s>
<s>  she was so certain that when she reached the city she immediately called the office and asked for mr. </s>
<s>  snow only to be told that he had gone away for a day or two on business. </s>
<s>  after that marian's thought was confused to the point of exasperation. </s>
<s>  it would be difficult to explain precisely the state of mind in which linda, upon arriving at her home that afternoon, received from katy the information that a man named snow had been waiting an hour for her in the living room. </s>
<s>  linda's appearance was that of a person so astonished that katy sidled up to her giving strong evidence of being ready to bristle. </s>
<s>  "ye know, lambie," she said with elaborate indifference, "ye aren't havin' to see anybody ye don't want to. </s>
<s>  if it's somebody intrudin' himself on ye, just say the word and i'll fire him. </s>
<s>  higher than guilderoy's kite i'll be firin' him. </s>
<s> " "no, i must see him, katy," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "and have something specially nice for dinner. </s>
<s>  very likely i'll take him to see peter morrison's house and possibly i'll ask him and peter to dinner. </s>
<s>  he is a san francisco architect from the firm where marian takes her lessons, and it's business about peter's house. </s>
<s>  i was surprised, that's all. </s>
<s> " then linda turned and laid a hand on each of katy's hairy red arms. </s>
<s>  "katherine o'donovan, old dear," she said, "if we do come back for dinner, concentrate on mr. </s>
<s>  snow and study him. </s>
<s>  scrutinize, katy! it's a bully word. </s>
<s>  scrutinize closely. </s>
<s>  to add one more to our long lists of secrets, here's another. </s>
<s>  he is the man i told you about who has asked marian to marry him, and marian has refused him probably because she prefers somebody nearer home. </s>
<s> " then linda felt the tensing of every muscle in katy's body. </s>
<s>  she saw the lift of her head, the incredulous, resentful look in her eyes. </s>
<s>  there was frank hostility in her tone. </s>
<s>  "well, who is there nearer home that marian knows?" she demanded belligerently. </s>
<s>  "well, now, who would there be?" retorted linda. </s>
<s>  "ye ain't manin' john gilman?" asked katy. </s>
<s>  "no," said linda, "i am not meaning john gilman. </s>
<s>  you should know marian well enough to know that. </s>
<s> " "well, ye ought to know yourself well enough to know that they ain't anybody else around these diggin's that marian thorne's going to get," said katy. </s>
<s>  "i imagine marian will get pretty much whom she wants," said linda laughingly. </s>
<s>  "in your heart, katy, you know that marian need not have lost john gilman if she had not deliberately let him go. </s>
<s>  if she had been willing to meet eileen on her own ground and to play the game with her, it wouldn't have happened. </s>
<s>  marian has more brains in a minute than eileen has in a month. </s>
<s> " when linda drew back the portiere and stepped into the living room eugene snow rose to meet her. </s>
<s>  what either of them expected it might be difficult to explain. </s>
<s>  knowing so little of each other, it is very possible that they had no visualizations. </s>
<s>  what snow saw was what everyone saw who looked at linda--a girl arrestingly unusual. </s>
<s>  with linda lay the advantage by far, since she had marian's letters for a background. </s>
<s>  what she saw was a tall man, slender, and about him there was to linda a strong appeal. </s>
<s>  as she looked into his eyes, she could feel the double hurt that fate had dealt him. </s>
<s>  she thought she could fathom the fineness in his nature that had led him to made home-building his chosen occupation. </s>
<s>  instantly she liked him. </s>
<s>  with only one look deep into his eyes she was on his side. </s>
<s>  she stretched out both her hands and advanced. </s>
<s>  "now isn't this the finest thing of you?" she said. </s>
<s>  "i am so glad that you came. </s>
<s>  i'll tell you word for word what happened here. </s>
<s> " "that will be fine," he said. </s>
<s>  "which is your favorite chair?" "you know," she said, "that is a joke. </s>
<s>  i am so unfamiliar with this room that i haven't any favorite chair. </s>
<s>  i'll have to take the nearest, like thoreau selected his piece of chicken. </s>
<s> " then for a few minutes linda talked frankly. </s>
<s>  she answered eugene snow's every question unhesitatingly and comprehensively. </s>
<s>  together they ascended the stairs, and in the guest room she showed him the table at which she and marian had studied the sketches of plans, and exactly where they had left them lying overnight. </s>
<s>  "the one thing i can't be explicit about," said linda, "is how many sheets were there in the morning. </s>
<s>  we had stayed awake so late talking, that we overslept. </s>
<s>  i packed marian's bag while she dressed. </s>
<s>  i snatched up what there were without realizing whether there were two sheets or three, laid them in the flat bottom of the case, and folded her clothing on top of them. </s>
<s> " "i see," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow comprehendingly. </s>
<s>  "now let's experiment a little. </s>
<s>  of course the window before that table was raised?"  "yes, it was," said linda, "but every window in the house is screened. </s>
<s> " "and what about the door opening into the hall? can you tell me whether it was closed or open?" "it was open," said linda. </s>
<s>  "we left it slightly ajar to create a draft. </s>
<s>  the night was warm. </s>
<s> " "is there anyone about the house," inquired mr. </s>
<s>  snow, "who could tell us certainly whether that window was screened that night?" "of course," said linda. </s>
<s>  "our housekeeper, katherine o'donovan, would know. </s>
<s>  when we go down we'll ask her. </s>
<s> " on their return to the living room, for the first time in her life linda rang for katy. </s>
<s>  she hesitated an instant before she did it. </s>
<s>  it would be establishing a relationship that never before had existed between them. </s>
<s>  she always had gone to katy as she would have, gone to her mother. </s>
<s>  she would have gone to her now, but she wanted katy to make her appearance and give her information without the possibility of previous discussion. </s>
<s>  katy answered the bell almost at once. </s>
<s>  linda went to her side and reached her arm across her shoulders. </s>
<s>  "katy," she said, "this is mr. </s>
<s>  eugene snow of san francisco he is interested in finding out exactly what became of that lost plan of marian's that we have looked for so carefully. </s>
<s>  put on your thinking cap, old dear, and try to answer accurately any question that mr. </s>
<s>  snow may wish to ask you. </s>
<s> " katy looked expectantly at eugene snow. </s>
<s>  "in the meantime," said linda, "i'll be excused and go bring round the bear cat. </s>
<s> " "i have only one question to ask you," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  "can you recall whether, for any reason, there was a screen out of the guest-room window directly in front of which the reading table was standing the night miss marian occupied the room before leaving for san francisco?" "sure there was," answered katy instantly in her richest, mellowest brogue. </s>
<s>  she was taking the inventory she had been told to take. </s>
<s>  she was deciding, as instantly as linda had done, that she liked this man. </s>
<s>  years, appearance, everything about him appealed to katy as being exactly right for marian. </s>
<s>  and her cunning irish mind was leaping and flying and tugging at the leash that thirty years of conventions had bound upon her. </s>
<s>  "sure," she repeated, "the wildest santana that ever roared over us just caught that screen and landed it slam against the side of the garage, and it set inside for three days till i could get a workman to go up the outside and put it back. </s>
<s>  it had been out two days before the night marian was here. </s>
<s> " "did miss linda know about it?" asked snow. </s>
<s>  "not that i know of," said katy. </s>
<s>  "she is a schoolgirl, you know, off early in the morning, back and up to her room, the busiest youngster the valley knows. </s>
<s>  and coin' a dale of good she is, too. </s>
<s>  it was miss eileen that heard the screen ripped out and told me it was gone. </s>
<s>  she is the one who looked after the housekapin' and paid the bills. </s>
<s>  she knew all about it. </s>
<s>  if 'twould be helpin' miss marian any about findin' them plans we've ransacked the premises for, i couldn't see any reason why miss eileen wouldn't tell ye the same as i am tellin' ye, and her housekapin' accounts and her cheque book would show she paid the carpenter, if it's legal business you're wantin'. </s>
<s> " "thank you, katy," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  "i hope nothing of that kind will occur. </s>
<s>  a great wrong has been perpetrated, but we must find some way to right it without involving such extremely nice young women in the annoyance of legal proceedings. </s>
<s> " katy folded her arms and raised her head. </s>
<s>  all her share of the blarney of ireland began to roll from the mellow tip of her tongue. </s>
<s>  "now, the nice man ye are, to be seein' the beauty of them girls so quick," she said. </s>
<s>  "the good lord airly in the mornin' of creation thought them out when he was jist fresh from rist, and the material was none shopworn. </s>
<s>  they ain't ladies like 'em anywhere else in the whole of california, and belave me, a many rale ladies have i seen in my time. </s>
<s>  ye can jist make up your mind that miss linda is the broth of the earth. </s>
<s>  she is her father's own child and she is like him as two pase in the pod. </s>
<s>  and marian growed beside her, and much of a hand i have had in her raisin' meself, and well i am knowin' how fine she is and what a juel she would be, set on any man's hearthstone. </s>
<s>  i am wonderin'," said katy challengingly, "if you're the mr. </s>
<s>  snow at whose place she is takin' her lessons, and if ye are, i am wonderin' if ye ain't goin' to use the good judgment to set her, like the juel she would be, ia the stone of your own hearth. </s>
<s> "  eugene snow looked at katy intently. </s>
<s>  he was not accustomed to discussing his affairs with household helpers, but he could not look at katy without there remaining in his vision the forte of linda standing beside her, a reassuring arm stretched across her shoulders, the manner in which she had presented her and then left her that she might be free to answer as she chose with out her young mistress even knowing exactly what was asked of her. </s>
<s>  such faith and trust and love were unusual. </s>
<s>  "i might try to do that very thing," he said, " you know, a wonderful woman is an animated jewel. </s>
<s>  you can't manufacture a setting and put her in and tighten the clasps without her consent. </s>
<s> " "then why don't you get it?" said katy casually. </s>
<s>  eugene snow laughed ruefully. </s>
<s>  "but suppose," he said, "that the particular jewel you're discussing prefers to select her own setting, and mine does not please her. </s>
<s> " "well, they's jist one thing," said katy. </s>
<s>  her heels left the floor involuntarily. </s>
<s>  she arose on her tiptoes. </s>
<s>  her shoulders came up, and her head lifted to a height it never had known before. </s>
<s>  "they's jist one thing," she said. </s>
<s>  "aside from miss linda, who is my very own child that i have washed and i have combed and i have done for since she was a toddlin' four-year-old, they ain't no woman in this world i would go as far for as i would for miss marian. </s>
<s>  but i am tellin' ye now, ye mr. </s>
<s>  eujane snow, that they's one thing i don't lend no countenance to. </s>
<s>  i am sorry she has had the cold, cruel luck that she has, but i ain't sorry enough that i am goin' to stand for her droppin' herself into the place where she doesn't belong. </s>
<s>  if the good lord ain't give her the sense to see that you're jist the image of the man that would be jist exactly right for her, somebody had better be tellin' her so. </s>
<s>  anyway, if miss linda is takin' ye up to the house that mr. </s>
<s>  pater morrison is buildin' and the pater man is there, i would advise ye to cast your most discernin' eye on that gintleman. </s>
<s>  ye watch him jist one minute when he looks at the young missus and he thinks nobody ain't observing him, and ye'll see what ye'll see. </s>
<s>  if ye want marian, ye jist go on and take her. </s>
<s>  i am not carin' whether ye use a club or white vi'lets, but don't ye be lettin' marian thorne get no idea into her head that she is goin' to take mr. </s>
<s>  pater morrison, because concernin' pater i know what i know, and i ain't goin' to stand by and see things goin' wrong for want of spakin' up. </s>
<s>  now if you're a wise man, ye don't nade nothing further said on the subject. </s>
<s> " eugene snow thought intently for a few moments. </s>
<s>  his vision centered on katherine o'donovan's face. </s>
<s>  "you're absolutely sure of this?" he said at last. </s>
<s>  "jist as sure as the sun's sure, and the mountains, and the seasons come and go," said katy with finality. </s>
<s>  "watch him and you'll see it stickin' out all over him. </s>
<s>  i have picked him for me boss, and it's jist adorin' that man crature i am. </s>
<s> " "what about miss linda?" inquired snow. </s>
<s>  "is she adoring him?" "she ain't nothing but a ganglin' school kid, adorin' the spade with which she can shoot around that bear cat of hers, and race the canyons, and the rely lovely things she can strike on paper with her pencil and light up with her joyous colors. </s>
<s>  her day and her hour ain't come, and the pater man's that fine he won't lay a finger on her to wake her up when she has a year yet of her schoolin' before her. </s>
<s>  but in the manetime it's my job to stand guard as i am standin' right now. </s>
<s>  i am tellin' ye frank and fair. </s>
<s>  ye go on and take marian thorne because ye ought to have her. </s>
<s>  if she is got any idea in her head that she is goin' to have pater morrison, she'll have to get it out. </s>
<s> " eugene snow held out his hand and started to the front door in answer to the growl of the bear cat. </s>
<s>  as he came down the steps and advanced to the car, linda, with the quick eye that had been one of her special gifts as a birthright, noted a change in him. </s>
<s>  he seemed to have been keyed up and toned up. </s>
<s>  there was a different expression on his face. </s>
<s>  there was buoyancy in his step. </s>
<s>  there was a visible determination in his eye. </s>
<s>  he took the seat beside her and linda started the car. </s>
<s>  she looked at him interrogatively. </s>
<s>  "can you connect a heavy wind with the date of the lost plan?" he inquired. </s>
<s>  "there was a crack-a-jack a few days before," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it blew over some trees in the lot next to us. </s>
<s> " "exactly," said snow. </s>
<s>  "and it plucked a screen from your guest-room window. </s>
<s>  katy thinks that the cheque to the carpenter and the cost of the repairs will be in your sister's account books. </s>
<s> " "um hm," nodded linda. </s>
<s>  "well, that simplifies matters, because peter morrison is going to tell you about a trip henry anderson made around our house the morning marian left. </s>
<s> " "i think that is about all we need to know," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow conclusively. </s>
<s>  "i think so," said linda, "but i want you to see peter's house for yourself, since i understand that according to your contract the rights to reproduce these particular plans remained with you after you had paid prize money for them. </s>
<s> " "most certainly," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  "we should have that much to show for our share of the transaction. </s>
<s> " "it's a queer thing," said linda. </s>
<s>  "you would have to know me a long time, and perhaps know under what conditions i have been reared in order to understand a feeling that i frequently have concerning people. </s>
<s>  i tobogganed down a sheer side of multiflores canyon one day without my path having been previously prepared, and i very nearly landed in the automobile that carried henry anderson and peter morrison on their first trip to lilac valley. </s>
<s>  i was much interested in preserving the integrity of my neck. </s>
<s>  i fervently hoped not to break more than a dozen of my legs and arms, and was forced to bring down intact the finest cotyledon pulverulenta that daddy or i had found in fourteen years of collecting in california. </s>
<s>  i am telling you all this that you may see why i might have been excused for not having been minutely observant of my surroundings when i landed. </s>
<s>  but what i did observe was a chilly, caterpillary sensation chasing up my spine the instant i met the eyes of henry anderson. </s>
<s>  in that instant i said to myself that i would not trust him, that i did not like him. </s>
<s> " "and what about his companion?" asked eugene snow lightly. </s>
<s>  "oh, peter?" said linda. </s>
<s>  there was a caress in her pronunciation of the name. </s>
<s>  "why, peter is a rock. </s>
<s>  the instant i deposited my cotyledon in a safe place i would have put my hand in peter morrison's and started around the world if he had asked me to go. </s>
<s>  there is only one peter. </s>
<s>  you will recognize that the instant you meet him. </s>
<s> " "i am altogether willing to take your word for it," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  "and there is one thing about this disagreeable business," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it was not peter's coat that had the plan in it. </s>
<s>  he knew nothing about it. </s>
<s>  he has had his full service of stiff war work, and he has been knocking around big cities in newspaper work, and now he has come home to lilac valley to 'set up his rest,' as in the hymn book, you know. </s>
<s>  he built his garage first and he is living in it because he so loves this house of his that he has to be present to watch it grow in minutes" detail. </s>
<s>  once on a time i saw a great wizard walking along the sidewalk, and he looked exactly like any man. </s>
<s>  he might have been you so far as anything different from other men in his appearance w as concerned. </s>
<s> " linda cut down the bear cat to its slowest speed. </s>
<s>  "what is on my mind is this," she said. </s>
<s>  "i don't think peter could quite afford the amount of ground he has bought, and the house he is building. </s>
<s>  i think possibly he is tying himself up in obligations. </s>
<s>  it may take him two or three years to come even on it. </s>
<s>  but it is a prepossession with him. </s>
<s>  now can't you see that if we go to him and tell him this sordid, underh unmanly tale, how his fine nature is going to be hurt, how his big heart is going to be wrung, how his home-house that he is building with such eager watchfulness will be a weighty old man of the sea clinging to his back? do you think, mr. </s>
<s>  eugene snow, that you're enough of a wizard to examine this house and to satisfy yourself as to whether it's an infringement of your plans or not, without letting peter know the things about it that would spoil it for him?" eugene snow reached across and closed a hand over the one of linda's nearest him on the steering wheel. </s>
<s>  "you very decent kid, you," he said appreciatively. </s>
<s>  "i certainly am enough of a wizard to save your peter man any disillusionment concerning his dream house. </s>
<s> " "oh, but he is not my peter man," said linda. </s>
<s>  "we are only the best friends in the world. </s>
<s>  really and truly, if you can keep a secret, he is marian's. </s>
<s> " "is he?" asked mr. </s>
<s>  snow interestedly. </s>
<s>  and then he added very casually, in the most offhand manner--he said it more to an orange orchard through which they were passing than he said it to linda--"i have very grave doubts about that. </s>
<s>  i think there must be some slight complication that will have to be cleared up. </s>
<s> " linda's heart gave a great jump of consternation. </s>
<s>  "indeed no," she said emphatically. </s>
<s>  "i don't think he has just told marian yet, but i am very sure that he cares for her more than for any other woman, and i am equally sure she cares for him. </s>
<s>  and nothing could be more suitable. </s>
<s> " "all right then," agreed mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  linda put the bear cat at the mountain, crept around the road, skirted the boulders, and stopped halfway to the garage. </s>
<s>  and there, in a low tone, she indicated to mr. </s>
<s>  snow where they had lunched, when she found the plans, how she had brought out the coat, where she had emptied the mouse nest. </s>
<s>  then she stepped from the car and hallooed for peter. </s>
<s>  peter came hurrying from the garage, and eugene snow was swift in his mental inventory. </s>
<s>  it coincided exactly with linda's. </s>
<s>  he would have been willing to join hands with peter and start around the world, quite convinced of the fairness of the outcome, with no greater acquaintance than one intent look at peter, one grip of his sure hand. </s>
<s>  after that he began to act on katy's hint, and in a very short time he had convinced himself that she was right. </s>
<s>  maybe peter tried to absorb himself in the plans he was going over, in the house he was proud to show the great architect. </s>
<s>  but it seemed to the man he was entertaining that his glance scarcely left linda, that he was so preoccupied with where she went and what she did that he was like a juggler keeping two mental balls in the air at the same time. </s>
<s>  it seemed to peter a natural thing that, the architect being in the city on business, he should run out to call on miss thorne's dearest friend it seemed to him equally natural that linda should bring him to see a house in which she was so kindly interesting herself. </s>
<s>  and just when peter was most dexterous in his juggling, just when he was trying to explain the very wonderful step-saving' time-saving, rational kitchen arrangements and at the same time watch linda on her course down to the spring, the architect halted him with a jerk. </s>
<s>  eugene snow stood very straight, his hands in his coat pockets, looking, peter supposed, with interest at the arrangements of kitchen conveniences. </s>
<s>  his next terse sentence fairly staggered peter. </s>
<s>  he looked him straight in the eye and inquired casually: "chosen your dream woman to fit your house, morrison?" peter was too surprised to conceal his feelings. </s>
<s>  his jaws snapped together. </s>
<s>  a belligerent look sprang into his eyes. </s>
<s>  "i have had a good deal to do with houses," continued mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  "they are my life work. </s>
<s>  i find that invariably they are built for a woman. </s>
<s>  almost always they are built from her plans, and for her pleasure. </s>
<s>  it's a new house, a unique house, a wonderful house you're evolving here. </s>
<s>  it must be truly a wonderful woman you're dreaming about while you build it. </s>
<s> " that was a nasty little trap. </s>
<s>  with his years and worldly experience peter should not have fallen into it. </s>
<s>  but all men are children when they are sick, heart sick or body sick, and peter was a very sick man at that minute. </s>
<s>  he had been addressed in such a frank and casual manner. </s>
<s>  his own brain shot off at queer tangents and led him constantly into unexpected places. </s>
<s>  the narrow side lane that opened up came into view so suddenly that peter, with the innocence of a four-year-old, turned with military precision at the suggestion and looked over the premises for the exact location of linda. </s>
<s>  eugene snow had seen for himself the thing that katy had told him he would see if he looked for it. </s>
<s>  suddenly he held out his hand. </s>
<s>  "as man to man, morrison, in this instance," he said in rather a hoarse, breathless voice, "don't you think it would be a good idea for you and me to assert our manhood, to manage our own affairs, to select our own wives if need be? if we really set ourselves to the job don't you believe we can work out our lives more to our liking than anyone else can plan for us? you get the idea, don't you, morrison?" peter was facing the kitchen sink but he did not see it. </s>
<s>  his brain was whirling. </s>
<s>  he did see snow's point of view. </s>
<s>  he did realize his position. </s>
<s>  but what mr. </s>
<s>  snow knew of his affairs he could only guess. </s>
<s>  the one thing mr. </s>
<s>  snow could not know was that linda frankly admitted her prepossession for her school chum, donald whiting, but in any event if peter could not have linda he would much prefer occupying his dream house alone. </s>
<s>  so he caught at the straw held out to him with both hands. </s>
<s>  "i get you," he said tersely. </s>
<s>  "it is not quite up to the mark of the manhood we like to think we possess to let our lives be engineered by a high school kid. </s>
<s>  suppose we do just quietly and masterfully assert ourselves concerning our own affairs. </s>
<s> " "suppose we do," said snow with finality. </s>
<s>  whereupon they shook hands with a grip that whitened their knuckles. </s>
<s>  then they went back to lilac valley and had their dinner together, and linda and peter escorted eugene snow to his train and started him on his return trip to san francisco feeling very much better. </s>
<s>  peter would not allow linda to drive him home at night, so he left her after the bear cat had been safely placed in the garage. </s>
<s>  as she stood on the walk beside him, strongly outlined in the moonlight, peter studied linda whimsically. </s>
<s>  he said it half laughingly, but there was something to think about in what he said: "i am just picturing, linda, what a nice old lady you will be by the time that high school kid of yours spends four years in college, one on the continent, and the lord knows how many at mastering a profession. </s>
<s> " linda looked at him with widened eyes. </s>
<s>  katy unburdens her mind 307 "why, what are you talking about, peter? are you moonstruck?" she inquired solicitously. </s>
<s>  "donald's only a friend, you know. </s>
<s>  i love him because he is the nicest companion. </s>
<s>  but there is nothing for you to be silly about. </s>
<s> " then peter began to realize the truth. </s>
<s>  there wasn't anything for him to be concerned about. </s>
<s>  she had not the slightest notion what love meant, even as she announced that she loved donald. </s>
<s>  chapter xxx. </s>
<s>  peter's release eugene snow returned to san francisco enthusiastic about linda, while he would scarcely have known how to express his appreciation of katherine o'donovan. </s>
<s>  he had been served a delicious dinner, deftly and quietly, such food as men particularly like. </s>
<s>  but there had been no subservience. </s>
<s>  if katherine o'donovan had been waiting on her own table, serving her own friends she could not have managed with more pride. </s>
<s>  it was very evident that she loved service, that she loved the girl to whom she gave constant attention. </s>
<s>  he understood exactly what there was in her heart and why she felt as she did when he saw linda and peter together and heard their manner of speaking to each other, and made mental note of the many points of interest which seemed to exist between them. </s>
<s>  he returned to san francisco with a good deal of a "see-the-conquering-hero-comes" mental attitude. </s>
<s>  he went directly to his office, pausing on the way for a box of candy and a bunch of parma violets. </s>
<s>  his first act on reaching the office was to send for miss thorne. </s>
<s>  marian came almost immediately, a worried look in her eyes. </s>
<s>  she sat in the big, cushioned chair that was offered her, and smiled faintly when the box was laid on her lap, topped with the violets. </s>
<s>  she looked at eugene snow with an "i-wish-you-wouldn't" expression on her face. </s>
<s>  but he smiled at her reassuringly. </s>
<s>  "nothing," he said. </s>
<s>  "picked them up on the way from the station. </s>
<s>  i made a hasty trip to that precious lilac valley of yours, and i must say it pales your representation. </s>
<s>  it is a wonderfully lovely spot. </s>
<s> " marian settled back in the chair. </s>
<s>  she picked up the violets and ran an experienced finger around the stems until she found the pin with which she fastened them at her waist. </s>
<s>  then as they occupied themselves making selections from the candy box he looked smilingly at marian. </s>
<s>  her eyes noted the change in him. </s>
<s>  he was neither disappointed nor sad. </s>
<s>  something had happened in lilac valley that had changed his perspective. </s>
<s>  womanlike, she began probing. </s>
<s>  "glad you liked my valley," she said. </s>
<s>  "we are told that blue is a wonderful aura to surround a person, and it's equally wonderful when it surrounds a whole valley. </s>
<s>  with the blue sky and the blue walls and a few true-blue friends i have there, it's naturally a very dear spot to me. </s>
<s> " "yes," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow, "i can see that it is. </s>
<s>  i ran down on a business matter. </s>
<s>  i have been deeply puzzled and much perturbed over this prize contest. </s>
<s>  we have run these affairs once a year, sometimes oftener, for a long time, so i couldn't understand the peculiar thing about the similarity of the winning plans and your work this year. </s>
<s>  i have been holding up the prize money, because i did not feel that you were saying exactly what was in your heart, and i couldn't be altogether satisfied that everything was right. </s>
<s>  i went to lilac valley because i had a letter from your friend, miss linda strong. </s>
<s>  there was an enclosure in it. </s>
<s> " he drew from his pocket the folded sheet and handed it to marian. </s>
<s>  her eyes were surprised, incredulous, as she opened the missing sheet from her plans, saw the extraneous lines drawn upon it and the minute figuring with which the margin was covered. </s>
<s>  "linda found it at last!" she cried. </s>
<s>  "where in this world did she get it, and whose work is this on it?" "she got it," said eugene snow, "when she undertook to clean peter morrison's workroom on an evening when she and her cook were having supper with him. </s>
<s>  she turned a coat belonging to his architect that hung with some of his clothing in peter morrison's garage. </s>
<s>  she was shaking the nest of a field mouse from one of the side pockets. </s>
<s>  naturally this emptied all the pockets, and in gathering up their contents she came across that plan, which she recognized. </s>
<s>  she thought it was right to take it and very wisely felt that it was man's business, so she sent it to me with her explanations. </s>
<s>  i went to lilac valley because i wanted to judge for myself exactly what kind of young person she was. </s>
<s>  i wanted to see her environment. </s>
<s>  i wanted to see the house that she felt sure was being built from these plans. </s>
<s>  i wanted to satisfy myself of the stability of what i had to work on before i mentioned the matter to you or henry anderson. </s>
<s> " marian sat holding the plan, listening absorbedly to what he was saying. </s>
<s>  "it's an ugly business," he said, "so ugly that there is no question whatever but that it can be settled very quietly and without any annoyance to you. </s>
<s>  i shall have to take the matter up with the board, but i have the details so worked out that i shall have no difficulty in arranging matters as i think best. </s>
<s>  there is no question whatever, marian, but anderson found that sketch on the west side of the strong residence. </s>
<s>  when you left your plans lying on a table before a window in the strong guestroom the night before you came to san francisco you did not know that the santana which raged through the valley a day or two previously had stripped a screen from the window before which you left them. </s>
<s>  in opening your door to establish a draft before you went to bed you started one that carried your top drawing through the window. </s>
<s>  waiting for miss strong the next morning, in making a circuit of the grounds anderson found it and appropriated it to most excellent advantage. </s>
<s>  miss linda tells me that your study of architecture was discussed at the dinner table that night. </s>
<s>  he could not have helped realizing that any sheet of plans he found there must have been yours. </s>
<s>  if he could acquit his conscience of taking them and using them, he would still have to explain why he was ready to accept the first prize and the conditions imposed when he already had a house fairly well under construction from the plans he submitted in the contest. </s>
<s>  the rule is unbreakable that the plans must be original, must be unused, must be our sole property, if they take the prize. </s>
<s> " marian was leaning forward, her eyes wide with interest, her breast agitated. </s>
<s>  she nodded in acquiescence. </s>
<s>  eugene snow reached across and helped himself to another piece of candy from the box on her knee. </s>
<s>  he looked at her speculatively and spoke quietly as if the matter were of no great importance. </s>
<s>  "would it be agreeable, marian, if the prize committee should announce that there were reasons as to why they were not satisfied, that they have decided to return all plans and call off the present contest, opening another in a few months in which interested parties may again submit their drawings? i will undertake swiftly and comprehensively to eliminate henry anderson from california. </s>
<s>  i would be willing to venture quite a sum that when i finish with the youngster he will see the beauty of going straight hereafter and the desirability of a change of atmosphere. </s>
<s>  he is a youngster. </s>
<s>  i hate to make the matter public, not only on account of involving you and your friends in such disagreeable business, but i am sorry for him. </s>
<s>  i would like to deal with him like the proverbial 'dutch uncle,' then i would like to send him away to make a new start with the assurance that i am keeping close watch on him. </s>
<s>  would you be satisfied if i handled the matter quietly and in my own way? could you wait a few weeks for justice?" marian drew a deep breath. </s>
<s>  "of course," she said, "it would be wonderful if you could do that. </s>
<s>  but what about peter morrison? how much did he know concerning the plans, and what does he know about this?" "nothing," said mr. </s>
<s>  snow. </s>
<s>  "that most unusual young friend of yours made me see the light very clearly concerning peter morrison. </s>
<s>  there is no necessity for him ever to know that the 'dream house,' as miss linda calls it, that he is building for his dream woman has any disagreeable history attached to it. </s>
<s>  he so loves the spot that he is living on it to watch that house in minutest detail. </s>
<s>  miss linda was fairly eloquent in the plea she made on his behalf. </s>
<s>  he strikes me as a very unusual person, and she  appealed to me in the same way. </s>
<s>  there must be some scientific explanation concerning her that i don't just get, but i can see that she is most unusual when i watched them together and heard them talk of their plans for the house and the grounds and discussing illustrations that she is making for articles that he is writing, i saw how deep and wholesome was the friendship existing between them. </s>
<s>  i even heard that wonderful serving woman, whom they so familiarly speak of as 'katy,' chiding peter morrison for allowing linda to take her typewriter to him and do her own work with a pen. </s>
<s>  and because miss linda seems so greathearted and loving with her friends, i was rather glad to hear his explanation that they were merely changing machines for the time being for a very particular reason of their own. </s>
<s> " "do you mean," asked marian, "that you think there is anything more than casual friendship between linda and peter morrison?" "not on her part," answered eugene snow. </s>
<s>  "anybody can see that she is a child deeply engrossed in all sorts of affairs uncommon for a girl of her age and position. </s>
<s>  her nice perceptions, her wonderful loyalty to her friends, her loving thought for them, are manifest in everything she says or does. </s>
<s>  if she ever makes any mistakes they will be from the head, not from the heart. </s>
<s>  but for the other end of the equation i could speak authoritatively. </s>
<s>  katy pointed out to me the fact that if i would watch peter morrison in miss linda's presence, i should see that he adored her. </s>
<s>  i did watch, and i did see that very thing. </s>
<s>  when i taxed him about building a dream house for a dream woman, his eyes crossed a plateau, leaped a brook, and started up the side of a mountain. </s>
<s>  they did not rest until they had found linda. </s>
<s> " marian sat so still that it seemed as if she were not even breathing. </s>
<s>  in view of what katy had said, and his few words with peter morrison, eugene snow had felt justified in giving marian a hint as to what was going on in lilac valley. </s>
<s>  exactly what he had done he had no means of knowing. </s>
<s>  if he had known and had talked intentionally he could not have made clearer to marian the thing which for months had puzzled her. </s>
<s>  she was aware that eugene snow was talking, that he was describing the dinner he had been served, the wonderful wild-flower garden that he had seen, how skillfully linda drove the bear cat. </s>
<s>  she heard these things and dimly comprehended them but underneath, her brain was seizing upon one fact after another. </s>
<s>  they had exchanged typewriters. </s>
<s>  the poor, foolish little kid had known how her health was wracked, how she was suffering, how her pride would not let her stoop to eileen's subterfuges and wage war with her implements for a man she did not want if her manner of living her everyday life did not appeal to him. </s>
<s>  linda had known how lonely and heart hungry and disappointed she had gone away, and loyally she had tried to create an interest in life for her. </s>
<s>  and she had succeeded entirely too well. </s>
<s>  and then in a panic she must have gone to peter morrison and explained the situation. </s>
<s>  and peter must have agreed to take over the correspondence. </s>
<s>  one by one things that had puzzled her about the letters and about the whole affair began to grow clear. </s>
<s>  she even saw how linda, having friendly association with no man save peter, would naturally use him for a model. </s>
<s>  the trouble was that, with her gift of penetration and insight and her facility with her pen, she had overdone the matter. </s>
<s>  she had not imitated peter. </s>
<s>  she had been peter. </s>
<s>  marian arose suddenly. </s>
<s>  she went home, locked the door, and one after another she read the letters that had piqued, amused, comforted, and finally intrigued her. </s>
<s>  they were brilliant letters, charming, appealing letters, and yet, with knowledge concerning them, marian wondered how she could have failed to appreciate in the beginning that they were from linda. </s>
<s>  "it goes to prove," she said at last, "how hungry the human heart is for love and sympathy. </s>
<s>  and that poor kid, what she must have suffered when she went to peter for help! and if, as mr. </s>
<s>  snow thinks, he cares for her, how he must have suffered before he agreed to help her, as no doubt he did. </s>
<s>  what i have to do is to find some way out of the situation that will relieve linda's anxiety and at least partially save my face. </s>
<s>  i shall have to take a few days to work it out. </s>
<s>  luckily i haven't answered my last letter. </s>
<s>  when i find out what i really want to say then i will be very careful how i say it. </s>
<s>  i don't just exactly relish having my letters turned over to peter morrison, but possibly i can think of some way--i must think of some way--to make them feel that i have not been any more credulous than they. </s>
<s> " while she thought, both linda and peter were doing much thinking on the same subject. </s>
<s>  linda's heart was full of gratitude to peter for helping her out of her very disagreeable situation. </s>
<s>  peter had not yet opened the packet of letters lying on his table he had a sickening distaste for the whole transaction. </s>
<s>  he had thought that he would wait until he received the first letter he was to answer. </s>
<s>  if it gave him sufficient foundation in itself for the answer, he would not be forced to search further. </s>
<s>  he had smoked many pipes on this decision. </s>
<s>  after the visit of mr. </s>
<s>  snow, peter had seen a great light and had decided, from the mood and the attitude of that gentleman after his interview with katy, that he very likely would be equal to any complication that might arise when he reached san francisco. </s>
<s>  mulling over the situation one day peter said reflectively to the spring which was very busy talking to him: "i am morally certain that this matter has resolved itself into a situation that closely resembles the bootblack's apple: 'they ain't goin' to be any core. </s>
<s> ' i am reasonably certain that i never shall have a letter to answer. </s>
<s>  in a few days probably i shall be able to turn back that packet to linda without having opened it. </s>
<s> " to make up for the perturbation which had resulted in failure in class and two weeks of work that represented her worst appearances in high-school history, linda, her mind freed from the worry over marian's plans, and her heart calmer over the fiasco in trying to comfort her, devoted herself absorbingly to her lessons and to the next magazine article that she must finish. </s>
<s>  she had decided that it was time to write on the subject of indian confections. </s>
<s>  her first spare minute she and katy must busy themselves working out the most delicious cactus candy possible. </s>
<s>  then they could try the mesquite candy. </s>
<s>  no doubt she could evolve a delicious gum from the mesquite and the incense plant. </s>
<s>  she knew she could from the willow milkweed. </s>
<s>  and under the head of "sweets" an appetizing jelly from manzanita. </s>
<s>  there were delightful drinks too, from the manzanita and the chia. </s>
<s>  and better than either, the lemonade berry would serve this purpose. </s>
<s>  she had not experimented to an authoritative extent with the desert pickles. </s>
<s>  and among drinks she might use the tea made from blue-eyed grass, brewed by the indians for feverish conditions. </s>
<s>  and there was a whole world of interest to open up in differing seeds and berries, parched or boiled for food. </s>
<s>  and there were the seeds that were ground for mush, like the thistle sage, and the mock orange which was food and soap also, and the wild sunflowers that were parched for meal, and above all, the acorns. </s>
<s>  she could see that her problem was not going to be one of difficulty in securing sufficient material for her book. </s>
<s>  it would be how to find time to gather all these things, and put them through the various processes and combinations necessary to make edible dishes from i them. </s>
<s>  it would mean a long summer of interesting and absorbing i work for her and for katy. </s>
<s>  much of it could not be done until the i summer was far advanced and the seeds and the berries were i ripe. </s>
<s>  she could rely on donald to help her search for the material. </s>
<s>  l with only herself and katy in the family they could give much of their time to the work. </s>
<s>  "where katy will rebel," said linda to herself, "is when it comes to gathering sufficient seeds and parching them to make these meal and mush dishes. </s>
<s>  she will call it 'fiddlin' business. </s>
<s> ' she shall be propitiated with a new dress and a beautiful bonnet, and she shall go with me frequently to the fields. </s>
<s>  the old dear loves to ride. </s>
<s>  first thing i do i'll call at the bank again and have our affairs properly straightened and settled there in the light of the letter daddy left me. </s>
<s>  then i shall have money to get all the furniture and the rugs and things we truly need. </s>
<s>  i'll repaint the kitchen and get katy some new cooking utensils to gladden her soul. </s>
<s>  and saturday i must make my trip with donald account for something worth while on the book. </s>
<s> " all these plans were feasible. </s>
<s>  what linda had to do was to accomplish them, and this she proceeded to do in a swift and businesslike manner. </s>
<s>  she soon reached the place where the whole house with the exception of eileen's suite had been gone over, freshened and refurnished to her liking. </s>
<s>  the guest-room furniture had been moved to her rejuvenated room. </s>
<s>  on the strength of her i returns from the book she had disposed of her furniture and was finding much girlish delight in occupying a beautiful room, daintily decorated, comfortably furnished with pieces of her own selection. </s>
<s>  as she and katy stood looking over their work when everything was ready for her first night of occupancy katy had said to her: "it's jist right and proper, lambie. </s>
<s>  it's jist the way it ought to be. </s>
<s>  and now say the word and let me clean out eileen's suate and get it ready for miss marian, so if she would drop down unexpected she would find we was good as our word. </s>
<s> " "all right," said linda. </s>
<s>  "and what am i to do with the stuff?" inquired katy. </s>
<s>  "katy, my dear," said linda with a dry laugh, "you'll think i am foolish, but i have the queerest feeling concerning those things. </s>
<s>  i can't feel that eileen has done with them. </s>
<s>  i can't feel that she will never want them again. </s>
<s>  i can't feel that they should go to some second-hand basement. </s>
<s>  pack all of her clothing that you can manage in her trunk and put it in the garret, and what the trunk won't hold pack in a tight box and put that in the garret also. </s>
<s>  she hasn't written me a line. </s>
<s>  she has sent me no address. </s>
<s>  i don't know what to do. </s>
<s>   as i have said before, i am going to save the things at least a year and see whether some day eileen won't think of something she wants to do with them. </s>
<s>  clean the rooms and i will order marian's things sent. </s>
<s> " according to these arrangements it was only a few days until linda wrote marian that her room was ready for her and that any time she desired to come and take possession she could test the lovingness of the welcome that awaited her by becoming intimately acquainted with it. </s>
<s>  marian answered the letter immediately. </s>
<s>  she said that she was planning to come very soon to test that welcome. </s>
<s>  she longed for the quiet of the valley, for its cool, clean, wild air. </s>
<s>  she was very tired. </s>
<s>  she needed rest. </s>
<s>  she thought she would love the new home they were offering her. </s>
<s>  then came two amazing paragraphs. </s>
<s>  the other day dana and i went into one of the big cafes in the city to treat ourselves to a taste of the entertainment with which the people of wealth regale themselves. </s>
<s>  we had wandered in laughingly jesting about what we should order, and ran into eileen in the company of her aunt and uncle and a very flashy and loudly dressed young man, evidently a new suitor of eileen's. </s>
<s>  i don't think eileen wanted to introduce us, and yet she acted like a person ravenous for news of her home and friends. </s>
<s>  she did introduce us, and immediately her ponderous uncle took possession of us. </s>
<s>  it seems that the man is a brother of eileen's mother. </s>
<s>  linda, he is big and gross, he is everything that a man of nice perceptions would not be, but he does love eileen. </s>
<s>  he is trying conscientiously to please her. </s>
<s>  his wife is the kind of person who would marry that kind of man and think everything he said and did was right. </s>
<s>  and the suitor, my dear, was the kind of man who could endure that kind of people. </s>
<s>  eileen was almost, if not quite, the loveliest thing i ever have seen. </s>
<s>  she was plain. </s>
<s>  she was simple. </s>
<s>  but it was the costly simplicity of extravagance. </s>
<s>  ye gods! but she had pearls of the size she had always wanted. </s>
<s>  she tried with all her might to be herself, but she knows me well enough to know what i would think and what i would write to you concerning the conditions under which i met her. </s>
<s>  we were simply forced to lunch with them. </s>
<s>  we could only nibble at the too rich, too highly seasoned food set before us. </s>
<s>  and i noticed that eileen nibbled also. </s>
<s>  she is not going to grow fat and waddle and redden her nose,  my dear, back deep in her eyes and in the curve of her lips and in the tone of her voice there were such disappointment and discontent as i never have seen in any woman. </s>
<s>  she could not suppress them. </s>
<s>  she could not conceal them. </s>
<s>  there was nothing on earth she could do but sit quietly and endure. </s>
<s>  they delivered us at our respective offices, leaving both of us dates on which to visit them, but neither of us intends to call on them. </s>
<s>  eileen's face was a tragedy when her uncle insisted on making the arrangements. </s>
<s>  i can at least spare her that. </s>
<s>  and now, my dear, life is growing so full and my time is so taken with my work at the office and with my widening friendships with dana and her friends and with mr. </s>
<s>  snow, that i really feel i have not time to go farther with our anonymous correspondence. </s>
<s>  it is all i can do to find time to write you letters such as the one i am writing i have done my best to play up to what you expected of me and i think i have succeeded in fooling you quite as much as you have felt that you were fooling me. </s>
<s>   linda dear, i want you always to know that i appreciate the spirit in which you began this thing. </s>
<s>  i know why you did it and i shall always love you a trifle more for your thought of me and your effort to tide over the very dark days you knew i would be facing in san francisco. </s>
<s>  i think, dear friend of mine, that i have had my share of dark days. </s>
<s>  i think there is very beautiful sunlight ahead for me. </s>
<s>  and by and by i hope to come into happiness that maybe is even more than my share. </s>
<s>  i am coming to see you soon and then i will tell you all about it. </s>
<s>  there was more of the letter, but at that point linda made one headlong rush for the bear cat. </s>
<s>  she took the curve on two wheels and almost ran into the mountain face behind the garage before she could slow down. </s>
<s>  then she set the cat screaming wildly for peter. </s>
<s>  as he came up to the car she leaned toward him, shaking with excitement. </s>
<s>  "peter," she cried, "have you opened that packet of letters yet?" "no," said peter, "i have not. </s>
<s> " "then give them to me quickly, peter," said linda. </s>
<s>  peter rushed into the garage and brought out the packet. </s>
<s>  linda caught it in both hands and dropped it in her lap. </s>
<s>  "well, thank god," she said devoutly. </s>
<s>  " peter, the joke's on me. </s>
<s>  marian knew i was writing those letters all the time and she just pretended that she cared for them to make the game interesting for me. </s>
<s>  and when she had so many friends and so much to do, she hadn't time for them any longer. </s>
<s>  then she pretended that she was getting awfully in earnest in order to stop me, and she did stop me all right. </s>
<s> " linda's face was a small panorama of conflicting emotions as she appealed to peter. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said in a quivering voice, "you can testify that she stopped me properly, can't you, peter?" peter tried to smile. </s>
<s>  he was older than linda, and he was thinking swiftly, intently. </s>
<s>  "yes, kid," he said with utmost corroboration, "yes, kid, she stopped you, but i can't see that it was necessary literally to scare the life out of you till she had you at the point where you were thinking of taking off from a mountain or into the sea. </s>
<s>  did you really mean that, linda?" linda relaxed suddenly. </s>
<s>  she sank back into the deeply padded seat of the bear cat. </s>
<s>  a look of fright and entreaty swept into her dark eyes. </s>
<s>  "yes, peter, i did mean it," she said with finality. </s>
<s>  "i couldn't have lived if i had hurt marian irreparably. </s>
<s>  she has been hurt so much already. </s>
<s>   peter, it was awfully nice of you to wait about reading these letters. </s>
<s>  even if she only did it for a joke, i think marian would rather that you had not read them. </s>
<s>  now i'll go back home and begin to work in earnest on the head piece of 'how to grow good citizens. </s>
<s> ' and i quite agree with you, peter, that the oath of allegiance, citizenship, and the title to a piece of real estate are the prime requisites. </s>
<s>  people have no business comma to our country to earn money that they intend to carry away to invest in the development and the strengthening of some other country that may some day be our worst enemy. </s>
<s>  i have not found out yet how to say it in a four-by-twelve-inch strip, but by the time i have read the article aloud to my skylight along about ten tonight i'll get an inspiration. </s>
<s>  i am sure i shall. </s>
<s> " "of course you will," said peter. </s>
<s>  "but don't worry about it, dear. </s>
<s>  don't lose sleep. </s>
<s>  take things slower. </s>
<s>  give time for a little more flesh to grow on your bones. </s>
<s>  and don't forget that while you're helping donald to keep at the head of his classes it's your  first job to keep at the head of your own. </s>
<s> " "thank you," said linda. </s>
<s>  "how is the dream coming?" "beautifully," said peter. </s>
<s>  "one of these days you're going to come rushing around the boulders and down the side of the building to find all this debris cleared away and the place for a lawn leveled. </s>
<s>  i am fighting down every possible avenue of expertise on the building in the effort to save money to make the brook run and the road wind where you have indicated that you want them to follow you. </s>
<s> " linda looked at peter while a queer, reflective light gathered in her eyes. </s>
<s>  at last she said soberly: "well, i don't know, peter, that you should make them so very personal to me as all that. </s>
<s> " "why not?" asked peter casually. </s>
<s>  "since there is no one else, why not?" linda released the clutch and started the car. </s>
<s>  she backed in front of the garage and turned. </s>
<s>  she was still thinking deeply as she stopped. </s>
<s>  once again she extended a hand to peter. </s>
<s>  "thank you a thousand times for not reading these letters, peter," she said. </s>
<s>  "i can't express how awfully fine i think it is of you. </s>
<s>  and if it's all right with you, perhaps there's not any real reason why you should not run that brook and drive that road the way i think they should go. </s>
<s>  somebody is going to design them. </s>
<s>  why shouldn't i, if it pleases you to have me?" "it pleases me very greatly," said peter--"more than anything else i can think of in all the world at this minute. </s>
<s> " and then he did a thing that he had done once or twice before. </s>
<s>  he bent back linda's fingers and left another kiss in the palm of her h and then he closed her fingers very tightly over it. </s>
<s>  chapter xxxi. </s>
<s>  the end of donald's contest the middle of the week linda had told katy that she intended stocking up the bear cat for three and that she would take her along on the next saturday's trip to her canyon kitchen. </s>
<s>  it was a day upon which she had planned to gather greens, vegetables, and roots, and prepare a dinner wholly from the wild. </s>
<s>  she was fairly sure exactly where in nature she would find the materials she wanted, but she knew that the search would be long and tiring. </s>
<s>  it would be jolly to have katy to help her prepare the lunch. </s>
<s>  it would please katy immensely to be taken. </s>
<s>  and the original things she said in her quaint irish brogue greatly amused donald. </s>
<s>  the arrangement had been understood among them for some time, so they all started on their journey filled with happy expectations. </s>
<s>  they closed the house and the garage carefully. </s>
<s>  linda looked over the equipment of the bear cat minutely making sure that her field axe, saw, knives, and her field glasses were in place. </s>
<s>  because more food than usual was to be prepared in the kitchen they took along a nest of cooking vessels and a broiler. </s>
<s>  they found donald waiting before either of them were ready, and in great glee, with much laughing and many jests they rolled down the valley in the early morning. </s>
<s>  they drove to the kitchen, spread their blankets, set up their table, and arranged the small circular opening for their day's occupancy. </s>
<s>  while katy and linda were busy with these affairs donald took the axe and collected a big heap of wood. </s>
<s>  then they left katy to burn the wood and have a deep bed of coals ready while they started out to collect from the canyon walls, the foot of the mountains, and the near-by desert the materials they would use for their dinner. </s>
<s>  just where the desert began to climb the mountain linda had for a long time watched a big bed of amole. </s>
<s>  donald used the shovel, she the hatchet, and soon they had brought to the surface such a quantity that donald protested. </s>
<s>  "but i have two uses for them today," explained linda. </s>
<s>  "they must serve for potatoes and they have to furnish our meat. </s>
<s> " "oh, i get you," said donald. </s>
<s>  "i have always been crazy to try that. </s>
<s> " so he began to dig again enthusiastically. </s>
<s>  "now i'll tell you what i think we had better do," said linda. </s>
<s>  "we will skirmish around this side of the mountain and find a very nice tender yucca shoot. </s>
<s>  and then we'll take these back to katy and let her bury them in the ashes and keep up the fire while we forage for the remainder of our wild indian feast. </s>
<s> " presently they found a yucca head that linda said was exactly right, a delicate pink, thicker than her wrist and two feet in length. </s>
<s>  with this and the amole they ran back to katy. </s>
<s>  she knew how to prepare the amole for roasting. </s>
<s>  linda gave her a few words of instruction concerning the yucca. </s>
<s>  then from the interior of the bear cat she drew a tightly rolled section of wire window screening. </s>
<s>  just where a deep, wide pool narrowed at a rocky defile they sank the screening, jammed it well to the bottom, fastened it tight at the sides, and against the current side of it they threw leaves, grass, chunks of moss, any debris they could gather that would make a temporary dam. </s>
<s>  then, standing on one side with her field knife, linda began to slice the remainder of the amole very thin and to throw it over the surface of the pool. </s>
<s>  on the other, donald pounded the big, juicy bulbs to pulp and scattered it broadcast over the water. </s>
<s>  linda instructed katy to sit on the bank with a long-handled landing net and whenever a trout arose, to snatch it out as speedily as possible, being careful not to take more than they would require. </s>
<s>  then the two youngsters, exhilarated with youth, with living, with the joy of friendship, with the lure of the valley, with the heady intoxication of the salt breeze and the gold of the sunshine, climbed into the bear cat and went rolling through the canyon and out to the valley on the far side. </s>
<s>  here they gathered the tenderest heart shoots of the lupin until linda said they had enough. </s>
<s>  then to a particular spot that she knew on the desert they hurried for the enlarged stems of the desert trumpet which was to serve that day for an appetizer in the stead of pickles. </s>
<s>  here, too, they filled a bucket from the heart of a big bisnaga cactus as a basis for their drink. </s>
<s>  among katherine o'donovan's cooking utensils there was a box of delicious cactus candy made from the preserved and sun-dried heart meat of this same fruit which was to serve as their confection. </s>
<s>  on the way back they stopped at the bridge and gathered cress for their salad. </s>
<s>  when they returned to katy she had five fine trout lying in the shade, and with more experienced eyes and a more skillful hand linda in a few minutes doubled this number. </s>
<s>  then they tore out the dam, rinsed the screen and spread it over a rock to dry. </s>
<s>  while donald scaled the fish linda put the greens to cook, prepared the salad and set the table. </s>
<s>  once, as he worked under her supervision, linda said to donald: "now about bread, kid--there's not going to be any bread, because the indians did not have it when they lived the way we are living today. </s>
<s>  when you reach the place where your left hand feels empty without a piece of bread in it, just butter up another amole and try it. </s>
<s>  it will serve the same purpose as bread, and be much better for the inner man. </s>
<s> " "if you would let me skin these fish," said donald, "i could do it much faster and make a better job of it. </s>
<s> " "but you shouldn't skin them. </s>
<s>  you want the skin to hold the meat together when it begins to cook tender. </s>
<s>  and you should be able to peel it off and discard it if it burns or gets smoky in the cooking. </s>
<s>  it's a great concession to clean them as we do. </s>
<s>  the   indians cooked them in the altogether and ate the meat from the bones. </s>
<s> " "oh my tummy!" said donald. </s>
<s>  "i always thought there was some dark secret about the indians. </s>
<s> " linda sat on a rock opposite him and clasped her hands around her knees. </s>
<s>  she looked at him meditatively. </s>
<s>  "did you?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "suppose you revise that opinion. </s>
<s>  our north american indians in their original state were as fine as any peoples that ever have been discovered the round of the globe. </s>
<s>  my grandfather came into intimate contact with them in the early days, and he said that their religion, embracing the idea of a great spirit to whom they were responsible for their deeds here, and a happy hunting ground to which they went as a reward for decent living, was as fine as any religion that ever has been practiced by people of any nation. </s>
<s>  immorality was unknown among them. </s>
<s>  family ties were formed and they were binding they loved their children and reared them carefully. </s>
<s>  they were hardy and healthful. </s>
<s>  until the introduction of whiskey and what we are pleased to term civilized methods of living, very few of them died save from war or old age. </s>
<s>  they were free. </s>
<s>  they were happy. </s>
<s>  the moping, lazy, diseased creature that you find sleeping in the sun around the reservations is a product of our civilization. </s>
<s>  nice commentary on civilization, isn't it?" "for heaven's sake, linda," said donald, "don't start any big brainstorming trains of thought today! grant me repose. </s>
<s>  i have overworked my brain for a few months past until i know only one thing for certain. </s>
<s> " "all right then, me lad, this is the time for the big secret," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i just happened to be in the assembly room on some business of my own last thursday afternoon when my sessions were over, and i overheard your professor in trigonometry tell a marl i did not know, who seemed to be a friend visiting him, that the son of judge whiting was doing the finest work that ever had been done in any of the los angeles high schools, and that undoubtedly you were going to graduate with higher honors than any other boy ever had from that school. </s>
<s> " donald sat thinking this over. </s>
<s>  he absently lifted an elbow and wiped the tiny scales from his face with his shirt sleeve. </s>
<s>  "young woman," he said solemnly, "them things what you're saying, are they 'cross your heart, honest to goodness, so help you,' truth, or are they the fruit of a perfervid imagination?" linda shook her head vigorously. </s>
<s>  "de but', kid," she said, "de gospel but'. </s>
<s>  you have the jap going properly. </s>
<s>  he can't stop you now. </s>
<s>  you have fought your good fight, and you have practically won it. </s>
<s>  all you have to do is to carry on till the middle of june, and you're it. </s>
<s> " "i wish dad knew," said donald in a low voice. </s>
<s>  "the judge does know," said linda heartily. </s>
<s>  "it wasn't fifteen minutes after i heard that till i had him on the telephone repeating it as fast as i could repeat. </s>
<s>  come to think of it, haven't you noticed a particularly cocky set of his head and the corksome lightness about his heels during the past few days?" "by jove, he has been happy about something!" said donald. </s>
<s>  "and i noticed that louise and the mater were sort of cheery and making a specialty of the only son and brother. </s>
<s> " "sure, brother, sure," said linda. </s>
<s>  "hurry up and scrape those fish and let's scamper down the canyon merely for the joy of flying with wings on our feet. </s>
<s>  you're it, young man, just it!" donald was sitting on a boulder. </s>
<s>  on another in front of him he was operating on the trout. </s>
<s>  his hands were soiled. </s>
<s>  his hair was tousled. </s>
<s>  he was fairly well decorated with fine scales. </s>
<s>  he looked at linda appealingly. </s>
<s>  "am i 'it' with you, linda?" he asked soberly. </s>
<s>  "sure you are," said linda. </s>
<s>  "you're the best friend i have. </s>
<s> " "will you write to me when i go to college this fall?" "why, you couldn't keep me from it," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i'll have  so many things to tell you. </s>
<s>  and when your first vacation comes we'll make it a hummer. </s>
<s> " "i know dad won't let me come home for my holidays except for the midsummer ones," said donald soberly. </s>
<s>  "it would take most of the time there would be of the short holidays to travel back and forth. </s>
<s> " "you will have to go very carefully about getting a start," said linda, "and you should be careful to find the right kind of friends at the very start. </s>
<s>  christmas and thanksgiving boxes can always be sent on time to reach you. </s>
<s>  it won't be so long for you as for us. </s>
<s>  and by the time you have oka sayye beaten to ravelings you will have such a 'perfect habit' that you will start right in with the beating idea. </s>
<s>  that should keep you fairly busy, because most of the men you come up against will be beaters themselves. </s>
<s> " "yes, i know," said donald. </s>
<s>  "are you going to start me to college with the idea that i have to keep up this beating habit? if i were to be one of fifty or a hundred, wouldn't that be good enough?" "why, sure," said linda, "if you will be satisfied with having me like fifty or a hundred as well as i do you. </s>
<s> " "oh, damn!" said donald angrily. </s>
<s>  "do i have to keep up this top-crust business all my days?" linda looked at him with a queer smile on her lips. </s>
<s>  "not unless you want to, donald," she said quietly. </s>
<s>  "not unless you think you would rather. </s>
<s> " donald scraped a fish vigorously. </s>
<s>  linda sat watching him. </s>
<s>  presently the tense lines around his eyes vanished. </s>
<s>  a faint red crept up his neck and settled on his left cheek bone. </s>
<s>  a confused grin slowly widened his naturally wide mouth. </s>
<s>  "then it's me for the top crust," he said conclusively. </s>
<s>  "then it's me for you," answered linda in equally as matter-of-fact tones. </s>
<s>  and rising, she gathered up the fish and carried them to katy while donald knelt beside the chilly stream and scoured his face and hands, after which linda whipped away the scales with an improvised brush of willow twigs. </s>
<s>  it was such a wonderful day. </s>
<s>  it was such an unusual and delicious feast. </s>
<s>  plump brook trout, fresh from icy water, delicately broiled over searing wood coals, are the finest of food. </s>
<s>  through the meal to the point where donald lay on his back at the far curve of the canyon wall, nibbling a piece of cactus candy, everything had been perfect. </s>
<s>  nine months would be a long time to be gone, but linda would wait for him, and she would write to him. </s>
<s>  he raised his head on his elbow and called across to her: "say, linda, how often will you write to me?" linda answered promptly: "every saturday night. </s>
<s>  saturday is our day. </s>
<s>  i'll tell you what has happened all the week. </s>
<s>  i'll tell you specially what a darned unprofitable day saturday is when you're three thousand miles away. </s>
<s> " bending over the canyon fireplace, her face red with heat and exertion, katherine o'donovan caught up her poker and beat up the fire until the ashes flew. </s>
<s>  "easy, katy, easy," cautioned linda. </s>
<s>  "we may want to bury those coals and resurrect them to warm up what is left for supper. </s>
<s> " "we'll do no such thing," said katy promptly. </s>
<s>  "what remains goes to feed the fish. </s>
<s>  next time it's hungry ye are, we're goin' to hit it straight to lilac valley and fill ourselves with god's own bread and beefsteak and paraties. </s>
<s>  don't ye think we're goin' to be atin' these haythen messes twice in one day. </s>
<s> " to herself she was saying: "the sooner i get you home to pater morrison, missy, the better i'll be satisfied. </s>
<s> " once she stood erect, her hands at her belt, her elbows widespread, and with narrowed eyes watched the youngsters. </s>
<s>  her lips were closed so tightly they wrinkled curiously as she turned back to the fireplace. </s>
<s>  "nayther one of them fool kids has come to yet," she said to herself, "and a mighty good thing it is that they haven't. </s>
<s> " linda was looking speculatively at donald as he lay stretched on the indian blanket at the base of the cliff. </s>
<s>  and then, because she was for ever busy with nature, her eyes strayed above him up the side of the cliff, noting the vegetation, the scarred rocks, the sheer beauty of the canyon wall until they reached the top. </s>
<s>  then, for no reason at all, she sat looking steadily at a huge boulder overhanging the edge of the cliff, and she was wondering how many ages it had hung there and how many more it would hang, poised almost in air, when a tiny pebble at its base loosened and came rattling and bounding down the canyon face. </s>
<s>  every nerve in linda tensed. </s>
<s>  she opened her mouth, but not a sound came. </s>
<s>  for a breathless second she was paralyzed. </s>
<s>  then she shrieked wildly: "donald, donald, roll under the ledge! quick, quick!" she turned to katy. </s>
<s>  "back, katy, back!" she screamed. </s>
<s>  "that boulder is loose. </s>
<s>  it's coming down!" for months donald whiting had obeyed linda implicitly and instantly. </s>
<s>  he had moved with almost invisible speed at her warning many times before. </s>
<s>  sometimes it had been a venomous snake, sometimes a yucca bayonet, sometimes poison vines, again unsafe footing--in each case instant obedience had been the rule. </s>
<s>  he did hot "question why" at her warning. </s>
<s>  he instantly did as he was told. </s>
<s>  he, too, had noticed the falling pebble. </s>
<s>  with all the agility of which he was capable he rolled under the narrow projecting ledge above him. </s>
<s>  katherine o'donovan was a good soldier also. </s>
<s>  she whirled and ran to the roadway. </s>
<s>  she had barely reached it when, with a grinding crash, down came the huge boulder, carrying bushes, smaller rocks, s and debris with it. </s>
<s>  on account of its weight it fell straight, struck heavily, and buried itself in the earth exactly on the spot upon which donald had been lying. </s>
<s>  linda raised terrified eyes to the top of the wall. </s>
<s>  for one instant a dark object peered over it and then drew back. </s>
<s>  without thought for herself linda rushed to the boulder, and kneeling, tried to see back of it. </s>
<s>  "donald!" she cried, "donald, are you all right?" "guess i am, unless it hit one foot pretty hard. </s>
<s>  feels fast. </s>
<s> " "can you get out?" she cried, beginning to tear with her hands at the stone and the bushes where she thought his head would be. </s>
<s>  "i am fast. </s>
<s>  but i am all right," he panted. </s>
<s>  "why the devil did that thing hang there for ages, and then come down on me today?" "yes, why did it?" gasped linda. </s>
<s>  "donald, i must leave you a minute. </s>
<s>  i have got to know if i saw a head peer over just as that stone came down. </s>
<s> " "be careful what you do!" he cried after her. </s>
<s>  linda sprang to her feet and rushed to the car. </s>
<s>  she caught out the field classes and threw the strap over her head as she raced to the far side of the fireplace where the walls were not so sheer. </s>
<s>  katherine o'donovan promptly seized the axe, caught its carrying strap lying beside it, thrust the handle through, swung it over her own head, dropped it between her shoulders, and ripping off her dress skirt she started up the cliff after linda. </s>
<s>  linda was climbing so swiftly and so absorbedly that she reached the top before she heard a sound behind her. </s>
<s>  then she turned with a white face, and her mouth dropped open as she saw katy three fourths of the way up the cliff. </s>
<s>  for one second she was again stiff with terror, then, feeling she could do nothing, she stepped back out of sight and waited a second until katy's red head and redder face appeared over the edge. </s>
<s>  realizing that her authority was of no avail, that katy would follow her no matter where she went or what she did, and with no time to argue, linda simply called to her encouragingly: "follow where i go. </s>
<s>  take your time. </s>
<s>  hang tight, old dear, it's dangerous!" she started around the side of the mountain, heading almost straight upward, traveling as swiftly and as noiselessly as possible. </s>
<s>  over big boulders, on precarious footing, clinging to bushes, they made their way until they reached a place that seemed to be sheer above them. </s>
<s>  certainly it was for hundreds of feet below on a point of rock screened by overhanging bushes linda paused until katy overtook her. </s>
<s>  "we are about stalled," she panted. </s>
<s>  "find a good footing and stay where you are. </s>
<s>  i am going to climb out on these bushes and see if i can get a view of the mountain side. </s>
<s> " advancing a few yards, linda braced herself, drew around her glasses, and began searching the side of the mountain opposite her and below as far as she could range with the glasses. </s>
<s>  at last she gave up. </s>
<s>  "must have gone the other way," she said to katy. </s>
<s>  "i'll crawl back to you. </s>
<s>  we'll go after help and get donald out. </s>
<s>  there will be time enough to examine the cliff afterward. </s>
<s>  but i am just as sure now as i will be when it is examined that that stone was purposely loosened to a degree where a slight push would drop it. </s>
<s>  as donald says, there's no reason why it should hang there for centuries and fall on him today. </s>
<s>  shut your eyes, old dear, and back up. </s>
<s>  we must go to donald. </s>
<s>  i rather think it's on one of his feet from what he said. </s>
<s>  let me take one more good look. </s>
<s> " at that minute from high on the mountain above them a shower of sand and pebbles came rattling down. </s>
<s>  linda gave katy one terrified look. </s>
<s>  "my god!" she panted. </s>
<s>  "he is coming down right above us!" just how linda recrossed the bushes and reached katy she did not know. </s>
<s>  she motioned for her to make her way back as they had come. </s>
<s>  katy planted her feet squarely upon the rock. </s>
<s>  her lower jaw shot out. </s>
<s>  her eyes were aflame. </s>
<s>  she stood perfectly still with the exception of motioning linda to crowd back under the bushes, and again linda realized that she had no authority. </s>
<s>  as she had done from childhood when katy was in earnest, linda obeyed her. </s>
<s>  she had barely reached the overhanging bushes, crouched under them, and straightened herself, when a small avalanche came showering down, and a minute later a pair of feet were level with her head. </s>
<s>  then screened by the bushes, she could have reached out and touched oka sayye. </s>
<s>  as his feet found a solid resting place on the ledge on which linda and katy stood, and while he was still clinging to the bushes, katherine o'donovan advanced upon him. </s>
<s>  he had felt that his feet were firm, let go his hold, and turned, when he faced the infuriated irishwoman. </s>
<s>  she had pulled the strap from around her neck, slipped the axe from it, and with a strong thrust she planted the head of it against oka sayye's chest so hard that she almost fell forward. </s>
<s>  the jap plunged backward among the bushes, the roots of which had supported linda while she used the glasses. </s>
<s>  then he fell, sliding among them, snatching wildly. </s>
<s>  linda gripped the overhanging growth behind which she had been screened, and leaned forward. </s>
<s>  "he has a hold. </s>
<s>  he is coming back up, katy!" she cried. </s>
<s>  katy took another step forward. </s>
<s>  she looked over the cliff down an appalling depth of hundreds of feet. </s>
<s>  deliberately she raised the axe, circled it round her head and brought it down upon that particular branch to which oka sayye was clinging. </s>
<s>  she cut it through, and the axe rang upon the stone wall behind it. </s>
<s>  as she swayed forward linda reached out, gripped katy and pulled her back. </s>
<s>  "get him?" she asked tersely, as if she were speaking of a rat or a rattlesnake. </s>
<s>  katy sank back limply against the wall. </s>
<s>  linda slowly turned her around, and as she faced the rock, "squeeze tight against it shut your eyes, and keep a stiff upper lip," she cautioned. </s>
<s>  "i am going to work around you. </s>
<s>  i want to be ahead of you. </s>
<s> " she squeezed past katy, secured the axe and hung it round her own neck. </s>
<s>  she cautioned katy to keep her eyes shut and follow where she led her, then they started on their way back. </s>
<s>  linda did not attempt to descend the sheer wall by which they had climbed, but making a detour she went lower, and in a very short time they were back in the kitchen. </s>
<s>  linda rushed to the boulder and knelt again, but she could get no response to her questions. </s>
<s>  evidently donald's foot was caught and he was unconscious from the pain. </s>
<s>  squeezing as close as she could, she thrust her arm under the ledge until she could feel his head. </s>
<s>  then she went to the other side, and there she could see that his right foot was pinned under the rock. </s>
<s>  she looked at katy reassuringly, then she took off the axe and handed it to her. </s>
<s>  "he is alive," she said. </s>
<s>  "can't kill a healthy youngster to have a crushed foot. </s>
<s>  you stand guard until i take the bear cat and bring help. </s>
<s>  it's not far to where i can find people. </s>
<s> " at full speed linda put the cat through the stream and out of the canyon until she reached cultivated l where she found a man who would gather other men and start to the rescue. </s>
<s>  she ran on until she found a house with a telephone. </s>
<s>  there she called judge whiting, telling him to bring an ambulance and a surgeon, giving him explicit directions as to where to come, and assuring him that donald could not possibly be seriously hurt. </s>
<s>  she found time to urge, also, that before starting he set in motion any precautions he had taken for donald's protection. </s>
<s>  she told him where she thought what remained of oka sayye could be found. </s>
<s>  and then, as naturally and as methodically as she had done all the rest, she called peter morrison and told him that she was in trouble and where he could find her. </s>
<s>  and because peter had many miles less distance to travel than the others she had summoned, he arrived first. </s>
<s>  he found linda and katy had burrowed under the stone until they had made an opening into which the broken foot might sink so that the pain of the pressure would be relieved. </s>
<s>  before the rock, with picks and shovels, half a dozen sympathetic farmers from ranches and cultivated land at the mouth of the canyon were digging furiously to make an opening undermining the boulder so that it could be easily tipped forward. </s>
<s>  donald was conscious and they had been passing water to him and encouraging him with the report that his father and a good surgeon would be there very soon. </s>
<s>  katherine o'donovan had crouched at one side of the boulder, supporting the hurt foot. </s>
<s>  she was breathing heavily and her usually red face was a ghastly green. </s>
<s>  linda had helped her to resume the skirt of her dress. </s>
<s>  at the other side of the rock the girl was reaching to where she could touch donald's head or reassuringly grip the hand that he could extend to her. </s>
<s>  peter seized linda's axe and began hewing at the earth and rock in order to help in the speedy removal of the huge boulder. </s>
<s>  soon judge whiting, accompanied by doctor fleming, the city's greatest surgeon, came caring into the canyon and stopped on the roadway when he saw the party. </s>
<s>  the judge sprang from the car, leaped the stream, and started toward them. </s>
<s>  in an effort to free his son before his arrival, all the men braced themselves against the face of the cliff and pushed with their combined strength. </s>
<s>  the boulder dropped forward into the trench they had dug for it enough to allow peter to crowd his body between it and the cliff and lift donald's head and shoulders. </s>
<s>  linda instantly ran around the boulder, pushed her way in, and carefully lifting donald's feet, she managed to work the lithe slenderness of her body through the opening, so that they carried donald out and laid him down in the open. </s>
<s>  he was considerably dazed and shaken, cruelly hurt, but proved himself a game youngster of the right mettle. </s>
<s>  he raised himself to a sitting posture, managing a rather stiff-lipped smile for his father and linda. </s>
<s>  the surgeon instantly began cutting to reach the hurt foot, while peter morrison supported the boy's head and shoulders on one side, his father on the other. </s>
<s>  an exclamation of dismay broke from the surgeon's lips. </s>
<s>  he looked at judge whiting and nodded slightly. </s>
<s>  the men immediately picked up donald and carried him to the ambulance. </s>
<s>  katherine o'donovan sat down suddenly and buried her face in the skirt of her dress. </s>
<s>  linda laid a reassuring hand on her shoulder. </s>
<s>  "don't, katy," she said. </s>
<s>  "keep up your nerve. </s>
<s>  you're all right, old dear. </s>
<s>  donald's fine. </s>
<s>  that doesn't mean anything except that his foot is broken, so he won't be able, and it won't be necessary for him, to endure the pain of setting it in a cast without an anesthetic. </s>
<s>  and doctor fleming can work much better where he has every convenience. </s>
<s>  it's all right. </s>
<s> " the surgeon climbed into the ambulance and they started on an emergency run to the hospital. </s>
<s>  as the car turned and swept down the canyon, for no reason that she could have explained, linda began to shake until her teeth clicked. </s>
<s>  peter morrison sprang back across the brook, and running to her side, he put his arm around her and with one hand he pressed her head against his shoulder, covering her face. </s>
<s>  "steady, linda," he said quietly, "steady. </s>
<s>  you know that he is all right. </s>
<s>  it will only be a question of a short confinement. </s>
<s> " linda made a brave effort to control herself. </s>
<s>  she leaned against peter and held out both her hands. </s>
<s>  "i am all right," she chattered. </s>
<s>  "give me a minute. </s>
<s> " judge whiting came to them. </s>
<s>  "i am getting away immediately," he said. </s>
<s>  "i must reach louise and mother before they get word of this. </s>
<s>  doctor fleming will take care of donald all right. </s>
<s>  what happened, linda? can you tell me?" linda opened her lips and tried to speak, but she was too breathless, too full of excitement, to be coherent. </s>
<s>  to her amazement katherine o'donovan scrambled to her feet, lifted her head and faced the judge. </s>
<s>  she pointed to the fireplace. </s>
<s>  "i was right there, busy with me cookie' utensils," she said l miss linda was a-sittin, on that exact spot, they jist havin 1 finished atin' some of her haythen messes. </s>
<s>  and the lad was lyin, square where the boulder struck, on the indian blanket, atin' a pace of cactus candy. </s>
<s>  and jist one pebble came rattlin' down, but miss linda happened to be lookin', and she scramed to the b'y to be rollin' under where ye found him. </s>
<s>  so he gave a flop or two, and it's well that he took his orders without waitin' to ask the raison for them, for if he had, at the prisint minute he would be about as thick as a shate of writing paper. </s>
<s>  the thing dropped clear and straight and drove itself into the earth and stone below it, as ye see. </s>
<s> " katherine o'donovan paused. </s>
<s>  "yes," said the judge. </s>
<s>  "anything else?" "miss linda got to him and she made sure he had brathin' space and he wasn't hurt bad, and then she told him he had got to stand it, because, sittin' where she did, she faced the cliff and she thought she had seen someone. </s>
<s>  she took the telescope and started climbin', and i took the axe and i started climbin' after her. </s>
<s> " katy broke down and emitted a weird irish howl. </s>
<s>  linda instantly braced herself, threw her arms around katy, and drew her head to her shoulder. </s>
<s>  she looked at judge whiting and began to talk "i can show you where she followed me, straight up the face of the canyon, almost," she said. </s>
<s>  "and she never had tried to climb a canyon side for a yard, either, but she came up and over after me, like a cat. </s>
<s>  and up there on a small ledge oka sayye came down directly above us. </s>
<s>  i couldn't be mistaken. </s>
<s>  i saw him plainly. </s>
<s>  i know him by sight as well as i do any of you. </s>
<s>  we heard the stones coming down before him, and we knew someone was going to be on us who was desperate enough to kill. </s>
<s>  when he touched our level and turned to follow the ledge we were on, i pushed him over. </s>
<s> " katy shook off linda's protecting arm and straightened suddenly. </s>
<s>  "why, ye domned little fool, ye!" she screamed. </s>
<s>  "ye never told a lie before in all your days! judge whiting, i had the axe round me neck by the climbin' strap, and i got it in me fingers when we heard the crature comin', and against his chist i set it, and i gave him a shove that sint him over. </s>
<s>  like a cat he was a-clingin' and climbin', and when i saw him comin' up on us with that awful face of his, i jist swung the axe like i do when i am rejoocin' a pace of eucalyptus to fireplace size, and whack! i took the branch supportin' him, and a dome' good axe i spoiled din' it. </s>
<s> " katy folded her arms, lifted her chin higher than it ever had been before, and glared defiance at the judge. </s>
<s>  "now go on," she said, "and decide what ye'll do to me for it. </s>
<s> " the judge reached over and took both katherine o'donovan's hands in a firm grip. </s>
<s>  "you brave woman!" he said. </s>
<s>  "if it lay in my power, i would give you the carnegie medal. </s>
<s>  in any event i will see that you have a good bungalow with plenty of shamrock on each side of your front path, and a fair income to keep you comfortable when the rheumatic days are upon you. </s>
<s> " "i am no over-feeder," said katy proudly. </s>
<s>  "i am daily exercisin' me muscles enough to kape them young. </s>
<s>  the rheumatism i'll not have. </s>
<s>  and nayther will i have the house nor the income. </s>
<s>  i have saved me money. </s>
<s>  i have an income of me own. </s>
<s> " "and as for the bungalow," interrupted linda, "katherine, as i have mentioned frequently before is my father, and my mother, and my whole family, and her front door is mine. </s>
<s> " "sure," said katy proudly. </s>
<s>  "when these two fine people before you set up their hearthstone, a-swapin' it i'll be, and carin' for their youngsters. </s>
<s>   judge, i would like a bit of the shamrock. </s>
<s>  ye might be sendin' me a start of that, if it would plase your honor. </s>
<s> " judge whiting looked intently at katherine o'donovan. </s>
<s>  and then, as if they had been on the witness st he looked searchingly at linda. </s>
<s>  but linda was too perturbed, too accustomed to katy's extravagant nonsense even to notice the purport of what she had said. </s>
<s>  then the judge turned his attention to peter morrison and realized that at least one of the parties to katherine's proposed hearthstone had understood and heartily endorsed her proposal. </s>
<s>  "i will have to be going. </s>
<s>  the boy and his mother will need me," he said. </s>
<s>  "i will see all of you later. </s>
<s> " then he sprang across the brook and sent his car roaring down the canyon after the ambulance. </s>
<s>  once more katy sank to the ground. </s>
<s>  linda looked at her as she buried her face and began to wail. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said quietly, "hunt our belongings and pack them in the bear cat the best you can. </s>
<s>  excuse us for a few minutes. </s>
<s>  we must act this out of our systems. </s>
<s> " gravely she sat down beside katy, laid her head on her shoulder, and began to cry very nearly as energetically as katy herself. </s>
<s>  and that was the one thing which was most effective in restoring katy's nerves. </s>
<s>  tears were such an unaccustomed thing with linda that katy controlled herself speedily so that she might be better able to serve the girl. </s>
<s>  in a few minutes katy had reduced her emotions to a dry sniffle. </s>
<s>  she lifted her head, groped for her pocket, and being unable to find it for the very good reason that she was sitting upon it, she used her gingham hem as a handkerchief. </s>
<s>  once she had risen to the physical effort of wiping her eyes, she regained calmness rapidly. </s>
<s>  the last time she applied the hem she looked at peter, but addressed the almighty in resigned tones: "there, lord, i guess that will do. </s>
<s> " in a few minutes she was searching the kitchen, making sure that no knives, spoons, or cooking utensils were lost. </s>
<s>  missing her support, linda sat erect and endeavored to follow katy's example. </s>
<s>  her eyes met peter's and when she saw that his shoulders were shaking, a dry, hysterical laugh possessed her. </s>
<s>  "yes, katy," she panted, "that will do, and remember the tears we are shedding are over donald's broken foot, and because this may interfere with his work, though i don't think it will for long. </s>
<s> " "when i cry," said katy tersely, "i cry because i feel like it. </s>
<s>  i wasn't wapin' over the snake that'd plan a death like that for anyone"--katy waved toward the boulder--"and nayther was i wastin' me tears over the fut of a kid bein' jommed up a trifle. </s>
<s> " "well, then, katy," asked linda tremulously, "why were you crying?" "well, there's times," said katy judicially, "when me spirits tell me i would be the better for lettin' off a wee bit of stame, and one of them times havin' arrived, i jist bowed me head to it, as is in accordance with the makings of me. </s>
<s>  far be it from me to be flyin' in the face of providence and sayin' i won't, when all me interior disposhion says to me: 'ye will!'" "and now, linda," said peter, "can you tell us why you were crying?" "why, i think," said linda, "that katy has explained sufficiently for both of us. </s>
<s>  it was merely time for us to howl after such fearful nerve strain, so we howled. </s>
<s> " "well, that's all right," said peter. </s>
<s>  "now i'll tell you something. </s>
<s>  if you had gone away in that ambulance to an anesthetic and an operation, no wildcat that ever indulged in a hunger hunt through this canyon could have put up a howl equal to the one that i would have sent up. </s>
<s> " "peter," said linda, "there is nothing funny about this. </s>
<s>  it's no tame for jest. </s>
<s>  but do men have nerves? would you really?" "of course i would," said peter. </s>
<s>  "no, you wouldn't," contradicted linda. </s>
<s>  "you just say that because you want to comfort us for having broken down, instead of trying to tease us as most men would. </s>
<s> " "he would, too!" said katy, starting to the bear cat with a load of utensils. </s>
<s>  "now come on. </s>
<s>  let's go home and be gettin' craned up and ready for what's goin' to happen to us. </s>
<s>  will they be jailin' us, belike, miss linda?" linda looked at peter questioningly. </s>
<s>  "no," he said quietly. </s>
<s>  "it is very probable that the matter never will be mentioned to you again, unless judge whiting gets hold of some clue that he wishes to use as an argument against matured japs being admitted in the same high-school classes with our clean, decent, young americans. </s>
<s>  they stopped that in the grades several years ago, i am told. </s>
<s> " before they could start back to lilac valley a car stopped in the canyon and a couple of men introducing themselves as having come from judge whiting interviewed katy and linda exhaustively. </s>
<s>  then linda pointed out to them an easier but much longer route by which they might reach the top of the canyon to examine the spot from which the boulder had fallen. </s>
<s>  she showed them where she and katy had ascended, and told them where they would be likely to find oka sayye. </s>
<s>  when it came to a question of really starting, linda looked with appealing eyes at peter. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said, "could we fix it any way so you could drive katy and me home? for the first time since i have begun driving this spring i don't feel equal to keeping the road. </s>
<s> " "of course," said peter. </s>
<s>  "i'll take your car to the nearest farmhouse and leave it, then i'll take you and katy in my car. </s>
<s> " late that evening judge whiting came to lilac valley with his wife and daughter to tell linda that the top of the cliff gave every evidence of the stone having been loosened previously, so that a slight impetus would send it crashing down at the time when donald lay in his accustomed place directly in the line of its fall. </s>
<s>  his detectives had found the location of the encounter and they had gone to the bottom of the cliff, a thousand feet below, but they had not been able to find any trace of oka sayye. </s>
<s>  somewhere in waiting there had been confederates who had removed what remained of him. </s>
<s>  on the way home mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting said to her husband: "judge, are you very sure that what the cook said to you this afternoon about miss strong and mr. </s>
<s>  morrison is true?" "i am only sure of its truth so far as he is concerned," replied the judge. </s>
<s>  "what he thought about linda was evident. </s>
<s>  i am very sorry. </s>
<s>  she is a mighty fine girl and i think donald is very much interested in her. </s>
<s> " "yes, i think so, too," said donald's mother. </s>
<s>  "interested. </s>
<s>  but he has not even a case of first love. </s>
<s>  he is interested for the same reason you would be or i would be, because she is intellectually so stimulating. </s>
<s>  and you have to take into consideration the fact that in two or three years more she will be ready for marriage and a home of her own, and donald will still be in school with his worldly experience and his business education not yet begun. </s>
<s>  the best thing that can happen to donald is just to let his infatuation for her die a natural death, with the quiet assistance of his family. </s>
<s> " the judge's face reddened slightly. </s>
<s>  "well, i would like mighty well to have her in the family," he said. </s>
<s>  "she is a corking fine girl. </s>
<s>  she would make a fine mother of fine men. </s>
<s>  i haven't a doubt but that with the power of his personality and the power of his pen and the lure of propinquity, peter morrison will win her, but i hate it. </s>
<s>  it's the best chance the boy ever will have. </s>
<s> " and then louise spoke up softly. </s>
<s>  "donald hasn't any chance, dad," she said quietly, "and he never did have. </s>
<s>  i have met peter morrison myself and i would be only too glad if i thought he was devoted to me. </s>
<s>  i'll grant that linda strong is a fine girl, but when she wakes up to the worth of peter morrison and to a realization of what other women would be glad to be to him, she will merely reach out and lay possessive hands upon what already belongs to her. </s>
<s> " it was a curious thing that such occurrences as the death of oka sayye and the injury to donald could take place and no one know about them. </s>
<s>  yet the papers were silent on the subject and so were the courts. </s>
<s>  linda and katy were fully protected. </s>
<s>  the confederates of oka sayye for reasons of their own preferred to keep very quiet. </s>
<s>  by monday donald, with his foot in a plaster cast, was on a side veranda of his home with a table beside him strewn with books and papers. </s>
<s>  an agreement had been made that his professors should call and hear his recitations for a few days until by the aid of a crutch and a cane he could resume his place in school. </s>
<s>  linda went to visit him exactly as she would have gone to see marian in like circumstances. </s>
<s>  she succeeded in making all of the whiting family her very devoted friends. </s>
<s>  one evening, after he had been hobbling about for over a week, linda and peter called to spend the evening, and a very gay and enjoyable evening it was. </s>
<s>  and yet when it was over and they had gone away together donald appeared worried and deeply thoughtful. </s>
<s>  when his mother came to his room to see if the foot was unduly painful or there was anything she could do to make him more comfortable, he looked at her belligerently. </s>
<s>  "mother," he said, "i don't like peter morrison being so much with my girl. </s>
<s> " mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting stood very still. </s>
<s>  she thought very fast. </s>
<s>  should she postpone it or should she let the boy take all of his hurts together? her heart ached for him and yet she felt that she knew what life had in store for him concerning linda. </s>
<s>  so she sat on the edge of the bed and began to talk quietly, plainly, reasonably. </s>
<s>  she tried to explain nature and human nature and what she thought the laws of probability were in the case. </s>
<s>  donald lay silent. </s>
<s>  he said nothing until she had finished all she had to say, and then he announced triumphantly: "you're all wrong. </s>
<s>  that is what would happen if linda were a girl like any of the other girls in her class, or like louise. </s>
<s>  but she has promised that she would write to me every saturday night and she has said that she thinks more of me than of any of the other boys. </s>
<s> " "donald dear," said mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting, "you're not 'in love' with linda yourself, and neither is she with you. </s>
<s>  by the time you are ready to marry and settle down in life, linda in all probability will be married and be the mother of two or three babies. </s>
<s> " "yes, like fun she will," said donald roughly. </s>
<s>  "have you asked her whether she loves you?" inquired mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting. </s>
<s>  "oh, that 'love' business," said donald, "it makes me tired! linda and i never did any mushing around. </s>
<s>  we had things of some importance to talk about and to do. </s>
<s> " a bit of pain in mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting's heart eased. </s>
<s>  it was difficult to keep her lips quiet and even. </s>
<s>  "you haven't asked her to marry you, then?" she said soberly. </s>
<s>  "oh good lord," cried donald, "'marry!' how could i marry anyone when i haven't even graduated from high school and with college and all that to come?" "that is what i have been trying to tell you," said his mother evenly. </s>
<s>  "i don't believe you have been thinking about marriage and i am absolutely certain that linda has not, but she is going to be made to think about it long before you will be in such financial position that you dare. </s>
<s>  that is the reason i am suggesting that you think about these things seriously and question yourself as to whether you would be doing the fair thing by linda if you tried to tie her up in an arrangement that would ask her to wait six or eight years yet before you would be ready. </s>
<s> " "well, i can get around faster than that," said donald belligerently. </s>
<s>  "of course you can," agreed his mother. </s>
<s>  "i made that estimate fully a year too long. </s>
<s>  but even in seven years linda could do an awful lot of waiting. </s>
<s>  and there are some very wonderful girls that will be coming up six or seven years from now here at home. </s>
<s>  you know that hereafter all the girls in the world are going to be very much more linda's kind of girls than they have been heretofore. </s>
<s>  the girls who have lived through the war and who have been intimate with its sorrow and its suffering and its terrible results to humanity, are not going to be such heedless, thoughtless, not nearly such selfish, girls as the world has known in the decade just past. </s>
<s>  and there is going to be more outdoor life, more nature study. </s>
<s>  there are going to be stronger bodies, better food, better-cared-for young people. </s>
<s>  and every year educational advantages are going to be greater. </s>
<s>  if you can bring yourself to think about giving up the idea of there ever existing any extremely personal thing between you and linda, i am very sure i could guarantee to introduce you to a girl who would be quite her counterpart, and undoubtedly we could meet one who would be handsomer. </s>
<s> " donald punched his pillow viciously. </s>
<s>  "that's nice talk," he said, "and it may be true talk. </s>
<s>  but in the first place i wish that peter morrison would let my girl alone, and in the second place i don't care if there are a thousand just as nice girls or even better-looking girls than linda, though any girl would be going some if she were nicer and better looking than linda. </s>
<s>  but i am telling you that when my foot gets better i am going to lilac valley and tell him where to head in, and i'll punch his head if he doesn't do it promptly. </s>
<s> " "of course you will," said his mother reassuringly. </s>
<s>  "and i'll go with you and we'll see to it that he attends strictly to his own affairs. </s>
<s> " donald burst out laughing, exactly as his mother in her heart had hoped that he would. </s>
<s>  "yes, i have got a hand-painted picture of myself starting to lilac valley to fight a man who is butting in with my girl, and taking my mother along to help me beat him up," he said. </s>
<s>  mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting put her arms around her boy, kissed him tenderly, and smoothed his hair, and then turned out the lights and slipped from the room. </s>
<s>  but in the clear moonlight as she closed the door she could see that a boyish grin was twisting his lips, and she went down to tell the judge that he need not worry. </s>
<s>  if his boy were irreparably hurt anywhere, it was in his foot. </s>
<s>  chapter xxxii. </s>
<s>  how the wasp built her nest the following weeks were very happy for linda. </s>
<s>  when the cast was removed from donald's foot and it was found that a year or two of care would put him even on the athletic fields and the dancing floor again, she was greatly relieved. </s>
<s>  she lacked words in which to express her joy that marian was rapidly coming into happiness. </s>
<s>  she was so very busy with her school work, with doing all she could to help donald with his, with her "jane meredith" articles, with hunting and working out material for her book, that she never had many minutes at a time for introspection. </s>
<s>  when she did have a few she sometimes pondered deeply as to whether marian had been altogether sincere in the last letter she had written her in their correspondence, but she was so delighted in the outcome that if she did at times have the same doubt in a fleeting form that had not been in the least fleeting with peter morrison, she dismissed it as rapidly as possible. </s>
<s>  when things were so very good as they were at that time, why try to improve them? one evening as she came from school, thinking that she would take katy for a short run in the bear cat before dinner, she noticed a red head prominent in the front yard as she neared home. </s>
<s>  when she turned in at the front walk and crossed the lawn she would have been willing to wager quite a sum that katy had been crying. </s>
<s>  "why, old dear," said linda, putting her arms around her, "if anything has gone wrong with you i will certainly take to the warpath, instanter. </s>
<s>  i can't even imagine what could be troubling you. </s>
<s> " linda lowered her voice. </s>
<s>  "nothing has come up about oka sayye?" katy shook her head. </s>
<s>  "i thought not," said linda. </s>
<s>  "judge whiting promised me that what use he made of that should be man's business and exploited wholly for the sake of california and her people. </s>
<s>  he said we shouldn't be involved. </s>
<s>  i haven't been worried about it even, although i am willing to go upon the stand and tell the whole story if it will be any help toward putting right what is at present a great wrong to california. </s>
<s> " "yes, so would i," said katy. </s>
<s>  "i am not worryin' meself about the little baste any more than i would if it had been a mad dog foaming up that cliff at ye. </s>
<s> " "then what is it?" asked linda. </s>
<s>  "tell me this minute. </s>
<s> " "i dunno what in the world you're going to think," said katy "i dunno what in the world you're going to do. </s>
<s> " her face was so distressed that linda's nimble brain flew to a conclusion. </s>
<s>  she tightened her arm across katy's shoulder. </s>
<s>  "by jove, katy!" she said breathlessly. </s>
<s>  "is eileen in the house?" katy nodded. </s>
<s>  "has she been to see john and made things right with him?" katy nodded again. </s>
<s>  "he is in there with her waitin' for ye," she said. </s>
<s>  it was a stunned linda who slowly dropped her arm, stood erect, and lifted her head very high. </s>
<s>  she thought intently. </s>
<s>  "you don't mean to tell me," she said, "that you have been crying over her?" katy held out both hands. </s>
<s>  "linda," she said, "she always was such a pretty thing, and her ma didn't raise her to have the sense of a peewee. </s>
<s>  if your pa had been let take her outdoors and grow her in the sun and the air, she would have been bigger and broader, an' there would have been the truth of god's sunshine an' the glory of his rain about her. </s>
<s>  ye know, linda, that she didn't ever have a common decent chance. </s>
<s>  it was curls that couldn't be shook out and a nose that dassen't be sunburned and shoes that mustn't be scuffed and a dress that shouldn't be mussed, from the day she was born. </s>
<s>  ye couldn't jist honest say she had ever had a fair chance, now could ye?" "no," said linda conclusively' "no, katherine o'donovan, you could not. </s>
<s>  but what are we up against? does she want to come back? does she want to stay here again?" "i think she would like to," said katy. </s>
<s>  "you go in and see her for yourself, lambie, before ye come to any decision. </s>
<s> " "you don't mean," said linda in a marveling tone, "that she has been homesick, that she has come back to us because she would like to be with us again?" "you go and see her for yourself. </s>
<s>  and if you don't say she is the worst beat out and the tiredest mortal that ye have ever seen you'll be surprisin' me. </s>
<s>  my god, linda, they ain't nothin' in bein' rich if it can do to a girl what has been done to eileen!" "oh, well," said linda impatiently, "don't condemn all money because eileen has not found happiness with it. </s>
<s>  the trouble has been that eileen's only chance to be rich came to her through the wrong kind of people. </s>
<s> " "well, will ye jist tell me, then," said katy, "how it happened that eileen's ma was a sister to that great beef of a man, which same is hard on self-rayspectin' beef. </s>
<s>  pork would come nearer. </s>
<s> " "yes," said linda, "i'll tell you. </s>
<s>  eileen's mother had a big streak of the same coarseness and the same vulgarity in her nature, or she could not have reared eileen as she did. </s>
<s>  she probably had been sent to school and had better advantages than the boy through a designing mother of her own. </s>
<s>  her first husband must have been a man who greatly refined and educated her. </s>
<s>  we can't ever get away from the fact that daddy believed in her and loved her. </s>
<s> " "yes," said katy, "but he was a fooled man. </s>
<s>  she wasn't what we thought she was. </s>
<s>  many's the time i have stood injustice about the accounts and household management because i wouldn't be wakin' him up to what he was bound to for life. </s>
<s> " "that doesn't help us," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i must go in and face them. </s>
<s> " she handed her books to katy, and went into the living room she concentrated on john gilman first, and a wee qualm of disgust crept through her soul when she saw that after weeks of suffering he was once more ready to devote himself to eileen. </s>
<s>  linda marveled at the power a woman could hold over a man that would force him to compromise with his intellect, his education and environment. </s>
<s>  then she turned her attention to eileen, and the shock she received was informing. </s>
<s>  she studied her an instant incredulously, then she went to her and held out her hand. </s>
<s>  "how do you do?" she said as cordially as was possible to her. </s>
<s> "this is unexpected. </s>
<s> " her mind was working rapidly, yet she could not recall ever having seen a woman quite so beautiful as eileen. </s>
<s>  she was very certain that the color on her cheeks was ebbing and rising with excitement. </s>
<s>  it was no longer so deep as to be stationary. </s>
<s>  she was very certain that her eyes had not been darkened as to lids or waxed as to lashes. </s>
<s>  her hair was beautifully dressed in sweeping waves with scarcely any artificial work upon it. </s>
<s>  her dress was extremely tasteful and very expensive. </s>
<s>  there was no simper on her lips, nothing superficial. </s>
<s>  she was only a tired, homesick girl. </s>
<s>  as linda looked at her she understood why katy had cried over her. </s>
<s>  she felt tears beginning to rise in her own heart. </s>
<s>  she put both arms protectingly around eileen. </s>
<s>  "why, you poor little thing," she said wonderingly, "was it so damn' bad as all that?" eileen stood straight. </s>
<s>  she held herself rigidly. </s>
<s>  she merely nodded. </s>
<s>  then after a second she said: "worse than anything you could imagine, linda. </s>
<s>  being rich with people who have grown rich by accident is a dreadful experience. </s>
<s> " "so i have always imagined," said linda. </s>
<s>  and then in her usual downright way she asked: "why did you come, eileen? is there anything you wanted of me?" eileen hesitated. </s>
<s>  it was not in linda's heart to be mean. </s>
<s>  "homesick, little sister?" she asked lightly "do you want to come here while you're getting ready to make a home for john? is that it?" then eileen swayed forward suddenly, buried her face in linda's breast, and for the first time in her life linda saw and heard her cry, not from selfishness, not from anger, not from greed, but as an ordinary human being cries when the heart is so full that nature relieves itself with tears. </s>
<s>  linda closed her arms around her and smiled over her head at john gilman. </s>
<s>  "finish all of it before you stop," she advised. </s>
<s>  "it's all right. </s>
<s>  you come straight home. </s>
<s>  you didn't leave me any word, and i didn't know what to do with your things, but i couldn't feel that you would want to give up such beautiful things that you had so enjoyed. </s>
<s>  we had planned for marian to spend her summer vacation here so i put her things in your suite and i had moved mine into the guest room, but i have had my room done over and the guest room things are in there, and every scrap of yours is carefully put away. </s>
<s>  if that will do, you are perfectly welcome to it. </s>
<s> " eileen wiped her eyes. </s>
<s>  "anything," she sobbed. </s>
<s>  "i would rather have katy's room than be shamed and humiliated and hurt any further. </s>
<s>  linda, i would almost like you to know my aunt callie, because you will never understand about her if you don't. </s>
<s>  her favorite pastime was to tell everyone we met how much the things i wore cost her. </s>
<s> " linda released eileen with a slight shake. </s>
<s>  "cheer up !" she said. </s>
<s>  "we'll all have a gorgeous time together. </s>
<s>  i haven't the slightest ambition to know more than that about your aunt callie. </s>
<s>  if my brain really had been acting properly i would never have dismantled your room. </s>
<s>  i would have known that you could not endure her, and that you would come home just as you should. </s>
<s>  it's all right, john, make yourself comfortable. </s>
<s>  i don't know what katy has for dinner but she can always find enough for an extra couple. </s>
<s>  come eileen, i'll help you to settle. </s>
<s>  where is your luggage?" "i brought back, linda, just what i have on," said eileen. </s>
<s>  "i will begin again where i left off. </s>
<s>  i realize that i am not entitled to anything further from the strong estate, but uncle was so unhappy and john says it's all right--really i am the only blood heir to all they have. </s>
<s>  i might as well take a comfortable allowance from it. </s>
<s>  i am to go to see them a few days of every month. </s>
<s>  i can endure that when i know i have john and you to come back to. </s>
<s> " when eileen had been installed in linda's old room linda went down to the kitchen, shut the door behind her, and leaning against it, laid her hand over her mouth to suppress a low laugh. </s>
<s>  "katy," she said, "i have been and gone and done it. </s>
<s>  i have put the perfect lady in my old room. </s>
<s>  that will be a test of her sincerity--even dainty and pretty as it is since it's been done over. </s>
<s>  if she is sincere enough to spend the summer getting ready to marry john gilman--why that is all right, old girl. </s>
<s>  we can stand it, can't we?" "yes," said katy, "it's one of them infernal nuisances but we can stand it. </s>
<s>  i am thinkin', from the looks of john gilman and his manner of spakin', that it ain't goin' to be but a very short time that he'll be waitin'. </s>
<s> " "katy," said linda, "isn't this the most entertaining world? doesn't it produce the most lightning-like changes, and don't the most unexpected things happen? sort of dazes me. </s>
<s>  i had planned to take a little run with you and the cat. </s>
<s>  since we are having--no, i mustn't say guests--since john and eileen have come home, i'll have to give up that plan until after dinner, and then we'll go and take counsel with our souls and see if we can figure out how we are going to solve this equation. </s>
<s>  and if you don t know what an equation is, old dear heart, it's me with a war-club and you with a shillalah and eileen between us, and be 'damned' to us if we can't make an average, ordinary, decent human being out of her. </s>
<s>  pin an apron on her in the morning, katy, and hand her a dust cloth and tell her to industrialize. </s>
<s>  we will help her with her trousseau, but she shall help us with the work. </s>
<s> " "ye know, lambie," whispered katy suddenly, "this is a burnin' shame. </s>
<s>  the one thing i didn't think about is that book of yours. </s>
<s>  what about it?" "i scarcely know," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it's difficult to say. </s>
<s>  of course we can't carry out the plans we had made to work here, exactly as we had intended, with eileen in the house preparing to be married. </s>
<s>  but she tells me that her uncle has made her a generous allowance, so probably it's environment and love she is needing much more than help. </s>
<s>  it is barely possible, katy, that after i have watched her a few days, if i decide she is in genuine, sincere, heart-whole earnest, i might introduce her and john to my friend, 'jane. </s>
<s> ' it is probable that if i did, eileen would not expect me to help her, and at the same time she wouldn't feel that i was acting indifferently because i did not. </s>
<s>  we'll wait awhile, katy, and see whether we skid before we put on the chains. </s>
<s> " "what about marian?" inquired katy. </s>
<s>  "i don't know," said linda thoughtfully. </s>
<s>  "if marian is big enough to come here and spend the summer under the same roof with eileen and john gilman, and have a really restful, enjoyable time out of it, she is bigger than i am. </s>
<s>  come up to the garret. </s>
<s>  i think eileen has brought no more with her than she took away. </s>
<s>  we'll bring her trunk down, put it in her room and lay the keys on top. </s>
<s>  don't begin by treating her as a visitor. </s>
<s>  treat her as if she were truly my sister. </s>
<s>  tell her what you want and how you want it, exactly as you tell me and as i tell you. </s>
<s>  if you see even a suspicion of any of the former objectionable tendencies popping up, let's check them quick and hard, katy. </s>
<s> " for a week linda watched eileen closely. </s>
<s>  at the end of that time she was sincere in her conviction that eileen had been severely chastened. </s>
<s>  when she came in contact with peter morrison or any other man they met she was not immediately artificial. </s>
<s>  she had learned to be as natural with men as with other women. </s>
<s>  there were no pretty postures, no softened vocal modulations, no childish nonsense on subjects upon which the average child of these days displays the knowledge of the past-generation grandmother. </s>
<s>  when they visited peter morrison's house it was easy to see that eileen was interested, more interested than any of them ever before had seen her in any subject outside of clothing and jewels. </s>
<s>  her conduct in the strong home had been irreproachable. </s>
<s>  she had cared for her own room, quietly undertaken the duties of dusting and arranging the rooms and cutting and bringing in flowers. </s>
<s>  she had gone to the kitchen and wiped dishes and asked to be taught how to cook things of which john was particularly fond. </s>
<s>  she had been reasonable in the amount of time she had spent on her shopping, and had repeatedly gone to linda and shown interest in her concerns. </s>
<s>  the result was that linda at once displayed the same interest in anything pertaining to eileen. </s>
<s>  one afternoon linda came home unusually early. </s>
<s>  she called for eileen, told her to tie on her sunshade and be ready for a short ride. </s>
<s>  almost immediately she brought around the bear cat and when they were seated side by side headed it toward the canyon. </s>
<s>  she stopped at the usual resting place, and together she and eileen walked down the light-dappled road bed. </s>
<s>  she pointed out things to eileen, telling her what they were, to what uses they could be put, while at the same time narrowly watching her. </s>
<s>  to her amazement she found that eileen was interested, that she was noticing things for herself, asking what they were. </s>
<s>  she wanted to know the names of the singing birds. </s>
<s>  when a big bird trailed a waving shadow in front of her linda explained how she might distinguish an eagle from a hawk, a hawk from a vulture, a sea bird from those of the land. </s>
<s>  when they reached the bridge linda climbed down the embankment to gather cress. </s>
<s>  she was moved to protest when eileen followed and without saying a word began to assist her, but she restrained herself, for it suddenly occurred to her that it would be an excellent thing for eileen to think more of what she was doing and why she was doing it than about whether she would wet her feet or muddy her fingers. </s>
<s>  so the protest became an explanation that it was rather late for cress: the leaves toughened when it bloomed and were too peppery. </s>
<s>  the only way it could be used agreeably was to work along the edges and select the small tender shoots that had not yet matured to the flowering point. </s>
<s>  when they had an armload they went back to the car, and without any explanation linda drove into los angeles and stopped at the residence of judge whiting, not telling eileen where she was. </s>
<s>  "friends of mine," said linda lightly as she stepped from the car. </s>
<s>  "fond of cress salad with their dinner. </s>
<s>  they prepare it after the jane meredith recipe to which you called my attention, in everybody's home last winter. </s>
<s>  come along with me. </s>
<s> " eileen stepped from the car and followed. </s>
<s>  linda led the way round the sidewalk to where her quick ear had located voices on the side lawn. </s>
<s>  she stopped at the kitchen door, handed in the cress, exchanged a few laughing words with the cook, and then presented herself at the door of the summerhouse. </s>
<s>  inside, his books and papers spread over a worktable, sat donald whiting. </s>
<s>  one side of him his mother was busy darning his socks. </s>
<s>  on the other his sister louise was working with embroidery silk and small squares of gaily colored linen. </s>
<s>  linda entered with exactly the same self-possession that characterized her at home. </s>
<s>  she shook hands with mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting, mary louise, and donald, and then she said quietly: "eileen and i were gathering cress and we stopped to leave you some for your dinner. </s>
<s> " with this explanation she introduced eileen to mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting. </s>
<s>  mary louise immediately sprang up and recalled their meeting at riverside. </s>
<s>  donald remembered a meeting he did not mention. </s>
<s>  it was only a few minutes until linda was seated beside donald, interesting herself in his lessons. </s>
<s>  eileen begged to be shown the pretty handkerchiefs that mary louise was making. </s>
<s>  an hour later linda refused an invitation to dinner because katy would be expecting them. </s>
<s>  when she arose to go, eileen was carrying a small square of blue-green linen. </s>
<s>  carefully pinned to it was a patch of white with a spray of delicate flowers outlined upon it, and a skein of pink silk thread. </s>
<s>  she had been initiated into the thrillingly absorbing feminine accomplishment of making sport handkerchiefs. </s>
<s>  when they left eileen was included naturally, casually, spontaneously, in their invitation to linda to run in any time she would. </s>
<s>  mary louise had said she would ride out with donald in few days and see how the handkerchiefs were coming on, and more instruction and different stitches and patterns were necessary, she would love to teach them. </s>
<s>  so linda realized that mary louise had been told about the trousseau. </s>
<s>  she knew, even lacking as she was in feminine sophistication, that there were two open roads to the heart of a woman. </s>
<s>  one is a wedding and the other is a baby. </s>
<s>  the lure of either is irresistible. </s>
<s>  as the bear cat glided back to lilac valley, eileen sat silent. </s>
<s>  for ten years she had coveted the entree to the whiting home perhaps more than any other in the city. </s>
<s>  merely by being simple and natural, by living her life as life presented itself each day, linda with no effort whatever had made possible to eileen the thing she so deeply craved. </s>
<s>  eileen was learning a new lesson each day--some days many of them--but none was more amazing more simple, or struck deeper into her awakened consciousness. </s>
<s>  as she gazed with far-seeing eye on the blue walls of the valley eileen was taking a mental inventory of her former self. </s>
<s>  one by one she was arraigning all the old tricks she had used in her trade of getting on in the world. </s>
<s>  one by one she was discarding them in favor of honesty, unaffectedness, and wholesome enjoyment. </s>
<s>  because of these things linda came home the next afternoon and left a bundle on eileen's bed before she made her way to her own room to busy herself with a head piece for peter's latest article. </s>
<s>  she had taken down the wasp picture and while she had not destroyed it she had turned the key of a very substantial lock upon it. </s>
<s>  she was hard at work when she heard steps on the stairs. </s>
<s>  when eileen entered, linda smiled quizzically and then broke into an unaffected ejaculation. </s>
<s>  "ripping!" she cried. </s>
<s>  "why, eileen, you're perfectly topping. </s>
<s> " eileen's face flamed with delight. </s>
<s>  she was a challenging little figure. </s>
<s>  none of them was accustomed to her when she represented anything more substantial than curls and ruffles. </s>
<s>  linda reached for the telephone, called gilman, and asked him if he could go to the beach for supper that evening. </s>
<s>  he immediately replied that he would. </s>
<s>  then she called peter morrison and asked him the same question and when peter answered affirmatively she told him to bring his car. </s>
<s>  then she hastily put on her own field clothes and ran to the kitchen to fill the lunch box. </s>
<s>  to katy's delight linda told her there would be room for her and that she needed her. </s>
<s>  it was evening and the sun was moving slowly toward the horizon when they stopped the cars and went down on the white sands of santa monica bay. </s>
<s>  eileen had been complimented until she was in a glow of delight. </s>
<s>  she did not notice that in piling things out of the car for their beach supper linda had handed her a shovel and the blackened iron legs of a broiler. </s>
<s>  everyone was loaded promiscuously as they took up their march down to as near the water's edge as the sands were dry. </s>
<s>  peter and john gathered driftwood. </s>
<s>  linda improvised two cooking places, one behind a rock for herself, the other under the little outdoor stove for katy. </s>
<s>  eileen was instructed as to how to set up the beach table, spread the blankets beside it, and place the food upon it. </s>
<s>  while katy made coffee and toasted biscuit linda was busy introducing her party to brigand beefsteak upon four long steel skewers. </s>
<s>  the day had been warm. </s>
<s>  the light salt breeze from the sea was like a benediction. </s>
<s>  friendly gulls gathered on the white sands around them. </s>
<s>  cunning little sea chickens worked in accord with the tide: when the waves advanced they rose above them on wing. </s>
<s>  when they retreated they scampered over the wet s hunting any small particles of food that might have been carried in. </s>
<s>  out over the water big brown pelicans went slowly fanning homeward. </s>
<s>  and white sea swallows drew wonderful pictures on the blue night sky with the tips of their wings. </s>
<s>  for a few minutes at the reddest point of its setting the sun painted a marvelous picture in a bank of white clouds. </s>
<s>  these piled up like a great rosy castle, and down the sky roadway before it came a long procession of armored knights, red in the sun glow and riding huge red horses. </s>
<s>  then the colors mixed and faded and a long red bridge for a short time spanned the water, ending at their feet. </s>
<s>  the gulls hunted the last scrap thrown them and went home. </s>
<s>  the swallows sought their high cliffs. </s>
<s>  the insidiously alluring perfume of sand verbena rose like altar incense around them. </s>
<s>  gilman spread a blanket, piled the beach fire higher, and sitting beside eileen, he drew her head to his shoulder and put his arm around her. </s>
<s>  possibly he could have been happier in a careless way if he had never suffered. </s>
<s>  it is very probable that the poignant depth of exquisite happiness he felt in that hour never would have come to him had he not lost eileen and found her again so much more worth loving. </s>
<s>  linda wandered down the beach until she reached the lighthouse rocks. </s>
<s>  she climbed on a high one and sat watching the sea as it sprayed just below. </s>
<s>  peter morrison followed her. </s>
<s>  "may i come up?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "surely," said linda, "this belongs to the lord. </s>
<s>  it isn't mine. </s>
<s> " so peter climbed up and sat beside her. </s>
<s>  "how did the landscape appeal to you when you left the campfire?" inquired linda. </s>
<s>  "i should think the night cry might very well be eight o'clock and all's well," answered peter. </s>
<s>  "'god's in his heaven, all's right with the world?'" linda put it in the form of a question. </s>
<s>  "it seems to be for john and eileen," said peter. </s>
<s>  "it is for a number of people," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i had a letter from marian today. </s>
<s>  i had written her to ask if she would come to us for the summer, in spite of the change in our plans. </s>
<s>  but mr. </s>
<s>  snow has made some plans of his own. </s>
<s>  he is a very astute individual. </s>
<s>  he wanted marian to marry him at once and she would not, so he took her for a short visit to see his daughter at her grandmother's home in the northern part of the state. </s>
<s>  marian fell deeply in love with his little girl, and of course those people found marian charming, just as right-minded people would find her. </s>
<s>  when she saw how the little girl missed her father and how difficult it was for him to leave her, and when she saw how she would be loved and appreciated in that fine family, she changed her mind. </s>
<s>  peter, we are going to be invited to san francisco to see them married very shortly. </s>
<s>  are you glad or sorry?" "i am very glad," said peter heartily. </s>
<s>  "i make no concealment of my admiration for miss thorne but i am very glad indeed that it is not her head that is to complete the decoration when you start the iris marching down my creek banks. </s>
<s> " "well, that's all right," said linda. </s>
<s>  "of course you should have something to say about whose head finished that picture. </s>
<s>  i can't contract to do more than set the iris. </s>
<s>  the thing about this i dread is that marian and eugene are going to live in san francisco, and i did so want her to make her home in lilac valley. </s>
<s> " "that's too bad," said peter sympathetically. </s>
<s>  "i know how you appreciate her, how deeply you love her. </s>
<s>  do you think the valley will ever be right for you without her, linda?" "it will have to be," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i have had to go on without father, you know. </s>
<s>  if greater happiness seems to be in store for marian in san francisco, all i can do is to efface myself and say 'amen. </s>
<s> ' when the world is all right for marian, it is about as near all right as it can be for me. </s>
<s>  and did you ever see much more sincerely and clearly contented people than john and eileen are at the present minute?" peter looked at linda whimsically. </s>
<s>  he lowered his voice as if a sea urchin might hear and tattle. </s>
<s>  "what did you do about the wasp, linda?" he whispered. </s>
<s>  "i delicately erased the stinger, fluffed up a ruffle, and put the sketch under lock and key. </s>
<s>  i should have started a fire with it, but couldn't quite bring myself to let it go, yet. </s>
<s> " "is she going to hold out?" asked peter. </s>
<s>  "she'll hold out or get her neck wrung," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i truly think she has been redeemed. </s>
<s>  she has been born again. </s>
<s>  she has a new heart and a new soul and a new impulse and a right conception of life. </s>
<s>  why, peter, she has even got a new body. </s>
<s>  her face is not the same. </s>
<s> " "she is much handsomer," said peter. </s>
<s>  "isn't she?" cried linda enthusiastically. </s>
<s>  "and doesn't having a soul and doesn't thinking about essential things make the most remarkable difference in her? it is worth going through a fiery furnace to come out new like that. </s>
<s>  i called her abednego the other day, but she didn't know what i meant. </s>
<s> " then they sat silent and watched the sea for a long time. </s>
<s>  by and by the night air grew chill. </s>
<s>  peter slipped from the rock and went up the beach and came back with an indian blanket. </s>
<s>  he put it very carefully around linda's shoulders, and when he went to resume his seat beside her he found one of her arms stretching it with a blanket corner for him. </s>
<s>  so he sat down beside her and drew the corner over his shoulder. </s>
<s>  and because his right arm was very much in his way, and it would have been very disagreeable if linda had slipped from the rock and fallen into the cold, salt, unsympathetic pacific at nine o'clock at night--merely to dispose of the arm comfortably and to ensure her security, peter put it around linda and drew her up beside him very close. </s>
<s>  linda did not seem to notice. </s>
<s>  she sat quietly looking at the pacific and thinking her own thoughts. </s>
<s>  when the fog became damp and chill, she said they must be going, and so they went back to their cars and drove home through the sheer wonder of the moonlight, through the perfume of the orange orchards, hearing the night song of the mockingbirds. </s>
<s>  chapter xxxiii. </s>
<s>  the lady of the iris a few days later linda and peter went to san francisco and helped celebrate the marriage of marian and eugene snow. </s>
<s>  they left marian in a home carefully designed to insure every comfort and convenience she ever had planned, furnished in accordance with her desires. </s>
<s>  both linda and peter were charmed with little deborah snow. </s>
<s>  she was a beautiful and an appealing child. </s>
<s>  "it seems to me," said linda, on the train going home, "that marian will get more out of life, she will love deeper, she will work harder, she will climb higher in her profession than she would have done if she had married john. </s>
<s>  it is difficult sometimes, when things are happening, to realize that they are for the best, but i really believe this thing has been for the level best. </s>
<s>  i think marian is going to be a bigger woman in san francisco than she ever would have been in lilac valley. </s>
<s>  with that thought i must reconcile myself. </s>
<s> " "and what about john?" asked peter. </s>
<s>  "is he going to be a bigger man with eileen than he would have been with marian?" "no," said linda, "he is not. </s>
<s>  he didn't do right and he'll have penalty to pay. </s>
<s>  eileen is developing into a lovable and truly beautiful woman, but she has not the intellect, nor the education, nor the impulse to stimulate a man's mental processes and make him outdo himself the way marian will. </s>
<s>  john will probably never know it, but he will have to do his own stimulating. </s>
<s>  he will have to vision life for himself. </s>
<s>  he will have to find his high hill and climb it with eileen riding securely on his shoulders. </s>
<s>  it isn't really the pleasantest thing in the world, it isn't truly the thing i wanted to do this summer--helping them out--but it has seemed to be the work at h the thing daddy probably would have wanted me to do, so it's up to me to do all i can for them, just as i did all i could for donald. </s>
<s>  one thing i shall always be delighted about. </s>
<s>  with my own ears i heard the pronouncement: donald had the jap beaten. </s>
<s>  he was at the head of his class before oka sayye was eliminated. </s>
<s>  the jap knew it. </s>
<s>  his only chance lay in getting rid of his rival. </s>
<s>  donald can take the excellent record he has made in this race to start on this fall when he commences another battle against some other man's brain for top honors in his college. </s>
<s> " "will he start with the idea that he wants to be an honor man?" linda laughed outright. </s>
<s>  "i think," she said, "his idea was that if he were one of fifty or one hundred leading men it would be sufficient, but i insisted that if he wanted to be first with me, he would have to be first in his school work. </s>
<s> " "i see," said peter. </s>
<s>  "linda, have you definitely decided that when you come to your home-making hour, donald is the man with whom you want to spend the remainder of your life?" "oh, good gracious!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "who's talking about 'homes' and 'spending the remainder of lives'? donald and i are school friends, and we are good companions. </s>
<s>  you're as bad as eileen. </s>
<s>  she is always trying to suggest things that nobody else ever thought of, and now katy's beginning it too. </s>
<s> " "sapheads, all!" said peter. </s>
<s>  "well, allow me to congratulate you on having given donald his spurs. </s>
<s>  i think it's a very fine thing for him to start to college with the honor idea in his head. </s>
<s>  what about your saturday excursions?" "they have died an unnatural death," said linda. </s>
<s>  "don and i fought for them, but the judge and mrs. </s>
<s>  whiting and mary louise were terrified for fear a bone might slip in don's foot, or some revengeful friend or relative of oka sayye lie in wait for us. </s>
<s>  they won't hear of our going any more. </s>
<s>  i go every saturday and take donald for a very careful drive over a smooth road with the bear cat cursing our rate of speed all the way. </s>
<s>  all the fun's spoiled for all three of us. </s>
<s> " "think i would be any good as a substitute when it comes to field work?" inquired peter casually. </s>
<s>  "i have looked at your desert garden so much i would know a cotyledon if i saw it. </s>
<s>  i believe i could learn. </s>
<s> " "you wouldn't have time to bother," objected linda. </s>
<s>  "you're a man, with a man's business to transact in the world. </s>
<s>  you have to hustle and earn money to pay for the bridge and changing the brook. </s>
<s> " "but i had money to pay for the brook and the bridge before i agreed to them," said peter. </s>
<s>  "well, then," said linda, "you should begin to hunt old mahogany and rugs. </s>
<s> " "i hadn't intended to," said peter. </s>
<s>  "if they are to be old, i won't have to do more than to ship them. </s>
<s>  in storage in virginia there are some very wonderful old mahogany and rosewood and rugs and bric-a-brac enough to furnish the house i am building. </s>
<s>  the stuff belonged to a little old aunt of mine who left it to me in her will, and it was with those things in mind that i began my house. </s>
<s>  the plans and finishing will fit that furniture beautifully. </s>
<s> " "why, you lucky individual!" said linda. </s>
<s>  "nowhere in the world is there more beautiful furniture than in some of those old homes in virginia. </s>
<s>  there are old flemish and dutch and british and italian pieces that came into this country on early sailing vessels for the aristocrats. </s>
<s>  you don't mean that kind of stuff, do you, peter?" "that is precisely the kind of stuff i do mean," answered peter. </s>
<s>  "why peter, if you have furniture like that," cried linda, "then all you need is mary louise. </s>
<s> " "linda," said peter soberly, "you are trespassing on delicate ground again. </s>
<s>  you selected one wife for me and your plan didn't work. </s>
<s>  when that furniture arrives and is installed i'll set about inducing the lady of my dreams to come and occupy my dream house, in my own way. </s>
<s>  i never did give you that job. </s>
<s>  it was merely assumed on your part. </s>
<s> " "so it was," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but you know i could set that iris and run that brook with more enthusiasm if i knew the lady who was to walk beside it. </s>
<s> " "you do," said peter. </s>
<s>  "you know her better than anyone else, even better than i. </s>
<s>  put that in your mental pipe and smoke it!" "saints preserve us!" cried linda. </s>
<s>  "i believe the man is planning to take katy away from me. </s>
<s> " "not from you," said peter, "with you. </s>
<s> " "let me know about it before you do it," said linda with a careless laugh. </s>
<s>  "that's what i am doing right now," said peter. </s>
<s>  "and i am going to school," said linda. </s>
<s>  "of course," said peter, "but that won't last forever. </s>
<s> " linda entered enthusiastically upon the triple task of getting donald in a proper frame of mind to start to college with the ambition to do good work, of marrying off eileen and john gilman, and of giving her best brain and heart to jane meredith. </s>
<s>  when the time came, donald was ready to enter college comfortable and happy, willing to wait and see what life had in store for him as he lived it. </s>
<s>  when she was sure of eileen past any reasonable doubt linda took her and john to her workroom one evening and showed them her book contract and the material she had ready, and gave them the best idea she could of what yet remained to be done. </s>
<s>  she was not prepared for their wholehearted praise, for their delight and appreciation. </s>
<s>  alone, they took counsel as to how they could best help her, and decided that to be married at once and take a long trip abroad would be the best way. </s>
<s>  that would leave linda to work in quiet and with no interruption to distract her attention. </s>
<s>  they could make their home arrangements when they returned. </s>
<s>  when they had gone linda worked persistently, but her book was not completed and the publishers were hurrying her when the fall term of school opened. </s>
<s>  by the time the final chapter with its exquisite illustration had been sent in, the first ones were coming back in proof, and with the proof came the materialized form of linda's design for her cover, and there was no marian to consult about it. </s>
<s>  linda worked until she was confused. </s>
<s>  then she piled the material in the bear cat and headed up lilac valley. </s>
<s>  as she came around the curve and turned from the public road she saw that for the first time she might cross her bridge. </s>
<s>  it was waiting for her. </s>
<s>  she heard the rejoicing of the water as it fell from stone to stone where it dipped under the road, and as she swung across the bridge she saw that she might drive over the completed road which had been finished in her weeks of absence. </s>
<s>  the windows told another story. </s>
<s>  peter's furniture had come and he had been placing it without telling her. </s>
<s>  she found the front door standing wide open, so she walked in. </s>
<s>  with her bundle on her arm she made her way to peter's workroom. </s>
<s>  when he looked up and saw her standing in his door he sprang to his feet and came to meet her. </s>
<s>  "peter," she said, "i have taken on more work than i can possibly finish on time, and i am the lonesomest person in california today. </s>
<s> " "i doubt that," said peter gravely. </s>
<s>  "if you are any lonesomer than i am you must prove it. </s>
<s> " "i have proved it," said linda quietly. </s>
<s>  "if you had been as lonesome as i am you would have come to me. </s>
<s>  as it is, i have come to you. </s>
<s> " "i see," said peter rather breathlessly. </s>
<s>  "what have you there, linda? why did you come?" "i came for two reasons," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i want to ask you about this stuff. </s>
<s>  several times this summer you have heard talk about jane meredith and the everybody's home articles. </s>
<s>  ever read any of them, peter?" "yes," said peter, "i read all of them. </s>
<s>  interested in home stuff these days myself. </s>
<s> " "well," said linda, dumping her armload before peter, "there's the proof and there's the illustration and there's the cover design for a book to be made from that stuff. </s>
<s>  peter, make your best boy and say 'pleased to meet you' to jane meredith. </s>
<s> " peter secured both of linda's hands and held them. </s>
<s>  first he looked at her, then he looked at the material she had piled down in front of him. </s>
<s>  "never again," said peter in a small voice, "will i credit myself with any deep discernment, any keen penetration. </s>
<s>  how i could have read that matter and looked at those pictures and not seen you in and through and over them is a thing i can't imagine. </s>
<s>  it's great, linda, absolutely great! of course i will help you any way in the world i can. </s>
<s>  and what else was it you wanted? you said two things. </s>
<s> " "oh, the other doesn't amount to much," said linda. </s>
<s>  "i only wanted the comfort of knowing whether, as soon as i graduate, i may take katy and come home, peter. </s>
<s> " from previous experience with linda, peter had learned that a girl reared by men is not as other women. </s>
<s>  he had supposed the other thing concerning which she had wanted to appeal to him was on par with her desire for sympathy and help concerning her book. </s>
<s>  at her question, with her eyes frankly meeting his, peter for an instant felt lightheaded. </s>
<s>  he almost dodged, he was so sweepingly taken unawares. </s>
<s>  linda was waiting and his brain was not working. </s>
<s>  he tried to smile, but he knew she would not recognize as natural the expression of that whirling moment. </s>
<s>  she saw his hesitation. </s>
<s>  "of course, if you don't want us, peter--" peter found his voice promptly. </s>
<s>  only his god knew how much he wanted linda, but there were conditions that a man of peter's soul-fiber could not endure. </s>
<s>  more than life he wanted her, but he did not want her asleep. </s>
<s>  he did not want to risk her awakening to a spoiled life and disappointed hopes. </s>
<s>  "but you remember that i told you coming home from san francisco that you knew the lady of my iris better than anyone else, and that i was planning to take katy, not from you, but with you. </s>
<s> " "of course i remember," said linda. </s>
<s>  "that is why when marian and eileen and donald and all my world went past and left me standing desolate, and my work piled up until i couldn't see my way, i just started right out to ask you if you would help me with the proof. </s>
<s>  of course i knew you would be glad to do that and i thought if you really meant in your heart that i was the one to complete your iris procession, it would be a comfort to me during the hard work and the lonesome days to have it put in two-syllable english. </s>
<s>  marian said that was the only real way--" "and marian is eminently correct. </s>
<s>  you will have to give me an ordinary lifetime, linda, in which to try to make you understand exactly what this means to me. </s>
<s>  perhaps i'll even have to invent new words in which to express myself. </s>
<s> " "oh, that's all right," said linda. </s>
<s>  "it means a lot to me too. </s>
<s>  i can't tell you how much i think of you. </s>
<s>  that first day, as soon as i put down the cotyledon safely and tucked in my blouse, i would have put my hand in yours and started around the world, if you had asked me to. </s>
<s>  i have the very highest esteem for you, peter. </s>
<s> " "esteem, yes," said peter slowly. </s>
<s>  "but linda-girl, isn't the sort of alliance i am asking you to enter with me usually based on something a good bit stronger than 'esteem'?" "yes, i think it is," said linda. </s>
<s>  "but you needn't worry. </s>
<s>  i only wanted the comfort of knowing that i was not utterly alone again, save for katy. </s>
<s>  i'll stick to my book and to my fight for senior honors all right. </s>
<s> " peter was blinking his eyes and fighting to breathe evenly. </s>
<s>  when he could speak he said as smoothly as possible: "of course, linda. </s>
<s>  i'll do your proof for you and you may put all your time on class honors. </s>
<s>  it merely occurred to me to wonder whether you realized the full and ultimate significance of what we are saying. </s>
<s>  exactly what it means to me and to you. </s>
<s> " "possibly not, peter," said linda, smiling on him with utter confidence. </s>
<s>  "everyone says i am my father's daughter, and father didn't live to coach me on being your iris decoration, as a woman would. </s>
<s>   peter, when the time comes, i have every confidence in your ability to teach me what you would like me to know yourself. </s>
<s>  don't you agree with me, peter?" making an effort to control himself peter gathered up the material linda had brought and taking her arm he said casually: "i thoroughly agree with you, dear. </s>

<s>  hear ye the history of the most holy vessel that is called graal, wherein the precious blood of the saviour was received on the day that he was put on rood and crucified in order that he might redeem his people from the pains of hell. </s>
<s>  josephus set it in remembrance by annunciation of the voice of an angel, for that the truth might be known by his writing of good knights, and good worshipful men how they were willing to suffer pain and to travail for the setting forward of the law of jesus christ, that he willed to make new by his death and by his crucifixion. </s>
<s>  title i. </s>
<s>  the high book of the graal beginneth in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. </s>
<s>  these three persons are one substance, which is god, and of god moveth the high story of the graal. </s>
<s>  and all they that hear it ought to understand it, and to forget all the wickednesses that they have in their hearts. </s>
<s>  for right profitable shall it be to all them that shall hear it of the heart. </s>
<s>  for the sake of the worshipful men and good knights of whose deeds shall remembrance be made, doth josephus recount this holy history, for the sake of the lineage of the good knight that was after the crucifixion of our lord. </s>
<s>  good knight was he without fail, for he was chaste and virgin of his body and hardy of heart and puissant, and so were his conditions without wickedness. </s>
<s>  not boastful was he of speech, and it seemed not by his cheer that he had so great courage. </s>
<s>  natheless, of one little word that he delayed to speak came to pass so sore mischances in greater britain, that all the islands and all the lands fell thereby into much sorrow, albeit thereafter he put them back into gladness by the authority of his good knighthood. </s>
<s>  good knight was he of right, for he was of the lineage of joseph of abarimacie. </s>
<s>  and this joseph was his mother's uncle, that had been a soldier of pilate's seven years, nor asked he of him none other guerdon of his service but only to take down the body of our saviour from hanging on the cross. </s>
<s>  the boon him seemed full great when it was granted him, and full little to pilate seemed the guerdon. </s>
<s>  for right well had joseph served him, and had he asked to have gold or land thereof, willingly would he have given it to him. </s>
<s>  and for this did pilate make him a gift of the saviour's body, for he supposed that joseph should have dragged the same shamefully through the city of jerusalem when it had been taken down from the cross, and should have left it without the city in some mean place. </s>
<s>  but the good soldier had no mind thereto, but rather honoured the body the most he might, rather laid it along in the holy sepulchre and kept safe the lance whereof he was smitten in the side and the most holy vessel wherein they that believed on him received with awe the blood that ran down from his wounds when he was set upon the rood. </s>
<s>  of this lineage was the good knight for whose sake is this high history treated. </s>
<s>  yglais was his mother's name: king fisherman was his uncle, and the king of the lower folk that was named pelles, and the king that was named of the castle mortal, in whom was there as much bad as there was good in the other twain, and much good was there in them. </s>
<s>  and these three were his uncles on the side of his mother yglais, that was a right good lady and a loyal. </s>
<s>  and the good knight had one sister, that hight dindrane. </s>
<s>  he that was head of the lineage on his father's side was named nichodemus. </s>
<s>  gais li gros of the hermit's cross was father of alain li gros. </s>
<s>  this alain had eleven brethren, right good knights, like as he was himself. </s>
<s>  and none of them all lived in his knighthood but twelve years, and they all died in arms for their great hardiment in setting forward of the law that was made new. </s>
<s>  there were twelve brethren. </s>
<s>  alain li gros was the eldest. </s>
<s>  gorgalians was next. </s>
<s>  bruns brandnils was the third. </s>
<s>  bertholez 1i chauz the fourth. </s>
<s>  brandalus of wales was the fifth. </s>
<s>  elinant of escavalon was the sixth. </s>

<s>  melaarmaus of abanie was the tenth. </s>
<s>  galians of the white tower the eleventh. </s>

<s>  ii. </s>
<s>  the authority of the scripture telleth us that after the crucifixion of our lord, no earthly king set forward the law of jesus christ so much as did king arthur of britain, both by himself and by the good knights that made repair to his court. </s>
<s>  good king arthur after the crucifixion of our lord, was such as i tell you, and was a puissant king, and one that well believed in god, and many were the good adventures that befel at his court. </s>
<s>  and he had in his court the table round that was garnished of the best knights in the world. </s>
<s>  king arthur after the death of his father led the highest life and most gracious that ever king led, in such sort that all the princes and all the barons took ensample of him in well-doing. </s>
<s>  for ten years was king arthur in such estate as i have told you, nor never was earthly king so praised as he, until that a slothful will came upon him and he began to lose the pleasure in doing largesse that he wont to have, nor was he minded to hold court neither at christmas-tide nor at easter nor at pentecost. </s>
<s>  the knights of the table round when they saw his well-doing wax slack departed thence and began to hold aloof from his court, insomuch as that of three hundred and three-score knights and six that he wont to have of his household, there were now not more than a five-and-twenty at most, nor did no adventure befal any more at his court. </s>
<s>  all the other princes had slackened of their well-doing for that they saw king arthur maintain so feebly. </s>
<s>  queen guenievre was so sorrowful thereof that she knew not what counsel to take with herself, nor how she might so deal as to amend matters so god amended them not. </s>
<s>  from this time beginneth the history. </s>
<s>  iii. </s>
<s>  it was one ascension day that the king was at cardoil. </s>
<s>  he was risen from meat and went through the hall from one end to the other, and looked and saw the queen that was seated at a window. </s>
<s>  the king went to sit beside her, and looked at her in the face and saw that the tears were falling from her eyes. </s>
<s>  "lady," saith the king, "what aileth you, and wherefore do you weep?" "sir," saith she, "and i weep, good right have i. </s>
<s>  and you yourself have little right to make joy. </s>
<s> " "certes, lady, i do not. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "you are right. </s>
<s>  i have seen on this high day, or on other days that were not less high than this, when you have had such throng of knights at your court that right uneath might any number them. </s>
<s>  now every day are so few therein that much shame have i thereof, nor no more do no adventures befal therein. </s>
<s>  wherefore great fear have i lest god hath put you into forgetfulness. </s>
<s> " "certes, lady," saith the king, "no will have i to do largesse nor aught that turneth to honour. </s>
<s>  rather is my desire changed into feebleness of heart. </s>
<s>  and by this know i well that i lose my knights and the love of my friends. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith the queen, "and were you to go to the chapel of s. </s>
<s>  augustine, that is in the white forest, that may not be found save by adventure only, methinketh that on your back-repair you would again have your desire of well-doing, for never yet did none discounselled ask counsel of god but he would give it for love of him so he asked it of a good heart. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith the king, "and willingly will i go, forasmuch as that you say have i heard well witnessed in many places where i have been. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "the place is right perilous and the chapel right adventurous. </s>
<s>  but the most worshipful hermit that is in the kingdom of wales hath his dwelling beside the chapel, nor liveth he now any longer for nought save only the glory of god. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith the king, "it will behove me go thither all armed and without knights. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "you may well take with you one knight and a squire. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith the king, "that durst not i, for the place is perilous, and the more folk one should take thither, the fewer adventures there should he find. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "one squire shall you take by my good will nor shall nought betide you thereof save good only, please god!" "lady," saith the king, "at your pleasure be it, but much dread i that nought shall come of it save evil only. </s>
<s> " thereupon the king riseth up from beside the queen, and looketh before him and seeth a youth tall and strong and comely and young, that was hight chaus, and he was the son of ywain li aoutres. </s>
<s>  "lady," saith he to the queen, "this one will i take with me and you think well. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "it pleaseth me well, for i have heard much witness to his valour. </s>
<s> " the king calleth the squire, and he cometh and kneeleth down before him. </s>
<s>  the king maketh him rise and saith unto him, "chaus," saith he, "you shall lie within to-night, in this hall, and take heed that my horse be saddled at break of day and mine arms ready. </s>
<s>  for i would be moving at the time i tell you, and yourself with me without more company. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith the squire, "at your pleasure. </s>
<s> " and the evening drew on, and the king and queen go to bed. </s>
<s>  when they had eaten in hall, the knights went to their hostels. </s>
<s>  the squire remained in the hall, but he would not do off his clothes nor his shoon, for the night seemed him to be too short, and for that he would fain be ready in the morning at the king's commandment. </s>
<s>  the squire was lying down in such sort as i have told you, and in the first sleep that he slept, seemed him the king had gone without him. </s>
<s>  the squire was sore scared thereat, and came to his hackney and set the saddle and bridle upon him, and did on his spurs and girt on his sword, as it seemed him in his sleep, and issued forth of the castle a great pace after the king. </s>
<s>  and when he had ridden a long space he entered into a great forest and looked in the way before him and saw the slot of the king's horse and followed the track a long space, until that he came to a launde of the forest whereat he thought that the king had alighted. </s>
<s>  the squire thought that the hoof-marks on the way had come to an end and so thought that the king had alighted there or hard by there. </s>
<s>  he looketh to the right hand and seeth a chapel in the midst of the launde, and he seeth about it a great graveyard wherein were many coffins, as it seemed him. </s>
<s>  he thought in his heart that he would go towards the chapel, for he supposed that the king would have entered to pray there. </s>
<s>  he went thitherward and alighted. </s>
<s>  when the squire was alighted, he tied up his hackney and entered into the chapel. </s>
<s>  none did he see there in one part nor another, save a knight that lay dead in the midst of the chapel upon a bier, and he was covered of a rich cloth of silk, and had around him waxen tapers burning that were fixed in four candlesticks of gold. </s>
<s>  this squire marvelled much how this body was left there so lonely, insomuch that none were about him save only the images, and yet more marvelled he of the king that he found him not, for he knew not in what part to seek him. </s>
<s>  he taketh out one of the tall tapers, and layeth hand on the golden candlestick, and setteth it betwixt his hose and his thigh and issueth forth of the chapel, and remounteth on his hackney and goeth his way back and passeth beyond the grave-yard and issueth forth of the launde and entereth into the forest and thinketh that he will not cease until he hath found the king. </s>
<s>  iv. </s>
<s>  so, as he entereth into a grassy lane in the wood, he seeth come before him a man black and foul-favoured, and he was somewhat taller afoot than was himself a-horseback. </s>
<s>  and he held a great sharp knife in his hand with two edges as it seemed him. </s>
<s>  the squire cometh over against him a great pace and saith unto him, "you, that come there, have you met king arthur in this forest?" "in no wise," saith the messenger, "but you have i met, whereof am i right glad at heart, for you have departed from the chapel as a thief and a traitor. </s>
<s>  for you are carrying off thence the candlestick of gold that was in honour of the knight that lieth in the chapel dead. </s>
<s>  wherefore i will that you yield it up to me and so will i carry it back, otherwise, and you do not this, you do i defy!" "by my faith," saith the squire, "never will i yield it you! rather will i carry it off and make a present thereof to king arthur. </s>
<s> " "by my faith," saith the other, "right dearly shall you pay for it, and you yield it not up forthwith. </s>
<s> " howbeit, the squire smiteth with his spurs and thinketh to pass him by, but the other hasteth him, and smiteth the squire in the left side with the knife and thrusteth it into his body up to the haft. </s>
<s>  the squire, that lay in the hall at cardoil, and had dreamed this, awoke and cried in a loud voice: "holy mary! the priest! help! help, for i am a dead man!" the king and the queen heard the cry, and the chamberlain leapt up and said to the king: "sir, you may well be moving, for it is day!" the king made him be clad and shod. </s>
<s>  and the squire crieth with such strength as he hath: "fetch me the priest, for i die!" the king goeth thither as fast as he may, and the queen and the chamberlain carry great torches and candles. </s>
<s>  the king asketh him what aileth him, and he telleth him all in such wise as he had dreamed it. </s>
<s>  "ha," saith the king, "is it then a dream?" "yea, sir," saith he, "but a right foul dream it is for me, for right foully hath it come true!" he lifted his left arm. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith he, "look you there! lo, here is the knife that was run into my side up to the haft!" after that, he setteth his hand to his hose where the candlestick was. </s>
<s>  he draweth it forth and showeth it to the king. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith he, "for this candlestick that i present to you, am i wounded to the death!" the king taketh the candlestick, and looketh thereat in wonderment for none so rich had he never seen tofore. </s>
<s>  the king showeth it to the queen. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith the squire, "draw not forth the knife of my body until that i be shriven. </s>
<s> " the king sent for one of his own chaplains that made the squire confess and do his houselling right well. </s>
<s>  the king himself draweth forth the knife of the body, and the soul departed forthwith. </s>
<s>  the king made do his service right richly and his shrouding and burial. </s>
<s>  ywain li aoutres that was father to the squire was right sorrowful of the death of his son. </s>
<s>  king arthur, with the good will of ywain his father, gave the candlestick to s. </s>
<s>  paul in london, for the church was newly founded, and the king wished that this marvellous adventure should everywhere be known, and that prayer should be made in the church for the soul of the squire that was slain on account of the candlestick. </s>
<s>  v. </s>
<s>  king arthur armed himself in the morning, as i told you and began to tell, to go to the chapel of s. </s>
<s>  augustine. </s>
<s>  said the queen to him. </s>
<s>  "whom will you take with you?" "lady," saith he, "no company will i have thither, save god only, for well may you understand by this adventure that hath befallen, that god will not allow i should have none with me. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "god be guard of your body, and grant you return safely so as that you may have the will to do well, whereby shall your praise be lifted up that is now sore cast down. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith he, "may god remember it. </s>
<s> " his destrier was brought to the mounting-stage, and the king mounted thereon all armed. </s>
<s>  messire ywain li aoutres lent him his shield and spear. </s>
<s>  when the king had hung the shield at his neck and held the spear in his h sword-girt, on the tall destrier armed, well seemed he in the make of his body and in his bearing to be a knight of great pith and hardiment. </s>
<s>  he planteth himself so stiffly in the stirrups that he maketh the saddlebows creak again and the destrier stagger under him that was right stout and swift, and he smiteth him of his spurs, and the horse maketh answer with a great leap. </s>
<s>  the queen was at the windows of the hall, and as many as five-and-twenty knights were all come to the mounting-stage. </s>
<s>  when the king departed, "lords," saith the queen, "how seemeth you of the king? seemeth he not a goodly man?" "yea, certes, lady, and sore loss is it to the world that he followeth not out his good beginning, for no king nor prince is known better learned of all courtesy nor of all largesse than he, so he would do like as he was wont. </s>
<s> " with that the knights hold their peace, and king arthur goeth away a great pace. </s>
<s>  and he entereth into a great forest adventurous, and rideth the day long until he cometh about evensong into the thick of the forest. </s>
<s>  and he espied a little house beside a little chapel, and it well seemed him to be a hermitage. </s>
<s>  king arthur rode thitherward and alighteth before this little house, and entereth thereinto and draweth his horse after him, that had much pains to enter in at the door, and laid his spear down on the ground and leant his shield against the wall, and hath ungirded his sword and unlaced his ventail. </s>
<s>  he looked before him and saw barley and provender, and so led his horse thither and smote off his bridle, and afterwards hath shut the door of the little house and locked it. </s>
<s>  and it seemed him that there was a strife in the chapel. </s>
<s>  the ones were weeping so tenderly and sweetly as it were angels, and the other spake so harshly as it were fiends. </s>
<s>  the king heard such voices in the chapel and marvelled much what it might be. </s>
<s>  he findeth a door in the little house that openeth on a little cloister whereby one goeth to the chapel. </s>
<s>  the king is gone thither and entereth into the little minster, and looketh everywhere but seeth nought there, save the images and the crucifixes. </s>
<s>  and he supposeth not that the strife of these voices cometh of them. </s>
<s>  the voices ceased as soon as he was within. </s>
<s>  he marvelleth how it came that this house and hermitage were solitary, and what had become of the hermit that dwelt therein. </s>
<s>  he drew nigh the altar of the chapel and beheld in front thereof a coffin all discovered, and he saw the hermit lying therein all clad in his vestments, and seeth the long beard down to his girdle, and his hands crossed upon his breast. </s>
<s>  there was a cross above him, whereof the image came as far as his mouth, and he had life in him yet, but he was nigh his end, being at the point of death. </s>
<s>  the king was before the coffin a long space, and looked right fainly on the hermit, for well it seemed him that he had been of a good life. </s>
<s>  the night was fully come, but within was a brightness of light as if a score of candles were lighted. </s>
<s>  he had a mind to abide there until that the good man should have passed away. </s>
<s>  he would fain have sate him down before the coffin, when a voice warned him right horribly to begone thence, for that it was desired to make a judgment within there, that might not be made so long as he were there. </s>
<s>  the king departed, that would willingly have remained there, and so returned back into the little house, and sate him down on a seat whereon the hermit wont to sir. </s>
<s>  and he heareth the strife and the noise begin again within the chapel, and the ones he heareth speaking high and the others low, and he knoweth well by the voices, that the ones are angels and the others devils. </s>
<s>  and he heareth that the devils are distraining on the hermit's soul, and that judgment will presently be given in their favour, whereof make they great joy. </s>
<s>  king arthur is grieved in his heart when he heareth that the angels' voices are stilled. </s>
<s>  the king is so heavy, that no desire hath he neither to eat nor to drink. </s>
<s>  and while he sitteth thus, stooping his head toward the ground, full of vexation and discontent, he heareth in the chapel the voice of a lady that spake so sweet and clear, that no man in this earthly world, were his grief and heaviness never so sore, but and he had heard the sweet voice of her pleading would again have been in joy. </s>
<s>  she saith to the devils: "begone from hence, for no right have ye over the soul of this good man, whatsoever he may have done aforetime, for in my son's service and mine own is he taken, and his penance hath he done in this hermitage of the sins that he hath done. </s>
<s> " "true, lady," say the devils, "but longer had he served us than he hath served you and your son. </s>
<s>  for forty years or more hath he been a murderer and robber in this forest, whereas in this hermitage but five years hath he been. </s>
<s>  and now you wish to thieve him from us. </s>
<s> " "i do not. </s>
<s>  no wish have i to take him from you by theft, for had he been taken in your service in suchwise as he hath been taken in mine, yours would he have been, all quit. </s>
<s> " the devils go their way all discomfit and aggrieved. </s>
<s>  and the sweet mother of our lord god taketh the soul of the hermit, that was departed of his body, and so commendeth it to the angels and archangels that they make present thereof to her dear son in paradise. </s>
<s>  and the angels take it and begin to sing for joy "te deum laudamus". </s>
<s>  and the holy lady leadeth them and goeth her way along with them. </s>
<s>  josephus maketh remembrance of this history and telleth us that this worthy man was named calixtus. </s>

<s>  he saw the day break clear and fair, and goeth his way toward the chapel to cry god mercy, thinking to find the coffin discovered there where the hermit lay. </s>
<s>  but so did he not! rather, was it covered of the richest tomb-stone that any might ever see, and had on the top a red cross, and seemed it that the chapel was all incensed. </s>
<s>  when the king had made his orison therein, he cometh back again and setteth on his bridle and saddle and mounteth, and taketh his shield and spear and departeth from the little house and entereth into the forest and rideth a great pace, until he cometh at right hour of tierce to one of the fairest laundes that ever a man might see. </s>
<s>  and he seeth at the entrance a spear set bar-wise, and looketh to the right or ever he should enter therein, and seeth a damsel sitting under a great leafy tree, and she held the reins of her mule in her hand. </s>

<s>  "yea, sir, i tell it you for true, but the launde and the forest about is so perilous that no knight returneth thence but he be dead or wounded. </s>
<s>  but the place of the chapel is of so great worthiness that none goeth thither, be he never so discounselled, but he cometh back counselled, so he may thence return on live. </s>
<s>  and lord god be guard of your body, for never yet saw i none aforetime that seemed more like to be good knight, and sore pity would it be and you were not, and never more shall i depart me hence and i shall have seen your end. </s>

<s>  sore ashamed is the king thereof. </s>
<s>  howbeit, he beholdeth an image of our lord that was there within and crieth him of mercy right sweetly, and looketh toward the altar. </s>
<s>  and he looketh at the holy hermit that was robed to sing mass and said his "confiteor", and seeth at his right hand the fairest child that ever he had seen, and he was clad in an alb and had a golden crown on his head loaded with precious stones that gave out a full great brightness of light. </s>
<s>  on the left hand side, was a lady so fair that all the beauties of the world might not compare them with her beauty. </s>
<s>  when the holy hermit had said his "confiteor" and went to the altar, the lady also took her son and went to sit on the right hand side towards the altar upon a right rich chair and set her son upon her knees and began to kiss him full sweetly and saith: "sir," saith she, "you are my father and my son and my lord, and guardian of me and of all the world. </s>

<s>  wherefore is the castle warred upon of them that would fain reave her thereof by force. </s>
<s>  the lord of the moors and another knight are they that war upon her and would fain reave her of this castle as they have reft he of seven other already. </s>
<s>  greatly desireth she the return of her son, for no counsel hath she save only of her one daughter and of five old knights that help her to guard the castle. </s>
<s>  sir," saith he, "the door is made fast and the bridge drawn up, for they guard the castle closely,  so please you, you will tell me your name and i will go before and make the bridge be 1owered and the gate unfastened, and will say that you will lodge within to-night. </s>
<s> " "gramercy," saith messire gawain, "right well shall my name be known or ever i depart from the castle. </s>
<s> " the squire goeth his way a great pace, and messire gawain tided softly at a walk for he had yet a long way to go. </s>
<s>  and he found a chapel that stood between the forest and the castle, and it was builded upon four columns of marble and within was a right fair sepulchre. </s>
<s>  the chapel had no fence of any kind about it so that he seeth the coffin within full clearly, and messire gawain bideth awhile to look thereon. </s>

<s>  "lady, he told me you should know it well or ever he depart from this castle. </s>

<s>  "sir," saith the damsel to messire gawain, "welcome may you be! but now sithence my mother supposed that you had been her son and made great joy thereof, and now seeth she plainly that you are not he, whereof is she sore sorrowful, for so soon as he shall return, this coffin behoveth open, nor until that hour shall none know who it is that lieth therein. </s>

<s>  "lady," saith messire gawain, "there was at the hostel of king fisherman a knight before whom the holy graal appeared three times, yet never once would he ask whereof it served nor whom it honoured. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith the widow lady's daughter, "you say true, and the best knight is he of the world. </s>
<s>  this say i for love of my brother, and i love all knights for the love of him, but by the foolish wit of the knight hath mine uncle king fisherman fallen into languishment. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith the lady, "behoveth all good knights go see the rich king fisherman. </s>
<s>  will you not therefore go?" "lady," saith messire gawain, "yea, that will i, so speedily as i may, for not elsewhither have i emprised my way. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith she, "then are you going to see my son, wherefore tell my son, and you see him, of mine evil plight and my misease, and king fisherman my brother. </s>
<s>  but take heed, messire gawain, that you be better mindful than was the knight. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith messire gawain, "i shall do as god shall teach me. </s>
<s> " in the meanwhile as they were speaking thus together, behold you therewithal the widow lady's five knights that were come in from the forest and make bring harts and hinds and wild swine. </s>

<s>  when the meat was ready they sate to eat, and full plenteously were they provided and right well were they served. </s>

<s>  "and what tidings?" saith she. </s>
<s>  "lady, there is to be a right great assembly of tourney in the valleys that aforetime were ours. </s>
<s>  already have they spread the welsh booths, and thither are come these two that are warring upon you and great store other knights. </s>
<s>  and they have ordained that he which shall do best at the assembly shall undertake the garrison of this castle in such sort as that he shall hold it for his own alone against all other. </s>
<s> " the widow lady beginneth to weep: "sir," saith she to messire gawain, "now may you understand that the castle is not mine own, sith that these knights say it is theirs as you hear. </s>
<s> " "certes, lady," saith he, "herein do they great dishonour and a sin. </s>
<s> " xi. </s>
<s>  when the table was removed the damsel fell at messire gawain's feet, weeping. </s>
<s>  he raiseth her forthwith and saith to her, "damsel, herein do you ill. </s>
<s> " "for god's sake, sir, take pity on my lady mother and me!" "certes, damsel, great pity have i of you. </s>
<s> " "sir, now shall it be seen in this strait whether you be good knight, for good is the knighthood that doeth well for god's sake. </s>
<s> " the widow lady and her daughter go into the chamber, and messire gawain's bed was made in the midst of the hall. </s>
<s>  so he went and lay down as did also the five knights. </s>
<s>  all the night was messire gawain in much thought. </s>
<s>  the morrow, when he was risen, he went to hear mass in a chapel that was within and ate thereafter three sops in wine and then armed him, and at the same time asked the five knights that were there in the hall whether they would go see the assembly. </s>

<s> " "in faith, thither verily will i go!" saith messire gawain. </s>
<s>  the knights are armed forthwith, and their horses brought and messire gawain's, and he goeth to take leave of the widow lady and her daughter. </s>
<s>  but great joy make they of this that they have heard say that he will go with their knights to the assembly. </s>
<s>  xii. </s>
<s>  messire gawain and the five knights mounted and issued forth of the castle and rode a great gallop before a forest. </s>
<s>  messire gawain looketh before him about the foreclose of the forest, and seeth the fairest purlieus that he had seen ever, and so broad they be that he may not see nor know the fourth part thereof. </s>
<s>  they are garnished of tall forests on one hand and on the other, and there are high rocks in the midst with wild deer among. </s>
<s>  "sir," say the knights, "lo, these be the valleys of camelot whereof my lady and her daughter have been bereft, and bereft also hath she been of the richest castles that be in wales to the number of seven. </s>
<s> " "a wrong is it and a sin!" saith messire gawain. </s>
<s>  so far have they ridden that they see the ensigns and the shields there where the assembly is to be held, and they see already mounted the more part of the knights all armed and running their horses down the meadow-land. </s>
<s>  and they see the tents stretched on the one hand and on another. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain bideth, and the five knights under a tree, and see the knights assembling on one hand and on another. </s>
<s>  one of the five knights that were with him gave him witting of the lord of the moors and the brother of the knight of the red shield that had to name chaos the red. </s>
<s>  so soon as the tournament was assembled, messire gawain and the knights come to the assembly, and messire gawain goeth to a welsh knight and beareth him to the ground, both him and his horse, all in a heap. </s>
<s>  and the five come after at a great gallop and each overthroweth his own, and greatly pride they themselves of messire gawain. </s>
<s>  chaos the red seeth messire gawain but knoweth him not. </s>
<s>  he goeth toward him a full career, and messire gawain receiveth him on the point of his spear and hurtleth against him so sore that he all to-brast his collarbone and maketh the spear fly from his fist. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain searcheth the fellowships of one part and the other, and findeth not nor encountereth no knight before him in his way but he putteth him off his horse or woundeth him, either by himself or by one of the five knights, that make right great joy of that they see him do. </s>
<s>  they show him the lord of the moors that was coming with a full great fellowship of folk. </s>
<s>  he goeth thitherward a great gallop. </s>
<s>  they mell together either upon other of their spears that they bent and all to-brast in flinders, and hurtle together so stoutly both of their horses and their bodies that the lord of the moors loseth his stirrups and hath the hinder saddlebow to-frushed, and falleth down to the ground over his horse croup in such sort that the peak of his helm dinteth a full palm's breadth into the turf. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain taketh the horse that was right rich and good, maugre all of his fellowship, and giveth it to one of the five knights that maketh it be led to camelot of a squire. </s>
<s>  messire gawain searcheth the ranks on the one hand and on the other, and doeth such feats of arms as never no knight might do the same again. </s>
<s>  the five knights also showed great hardiment, and did more of arms that day than ever had they done tofore, for not one of them but had overthrown at least a single knight and won his horse. </s>
<s>  the lord of the moors was mounted again on another rich horse and had great shame for that messire gawain had overthrown him. </s>
<s>  he espieth messire gawain and goeth toward him a great gallop and thinketh to avenge his shame. </s>
<s>  they come together either on other with a great shock, and messire gawain smiteth him with the truncheon of his spear that he had still left, in the midst of his breast, so that it was all to-splintered. </s>
<s>  the lord of the moors likewise again to-brast his spear upon him. </s>
<s>  messire gawain draweth his sword and flingeth the truncheon to the ground. </s>
<s>  the lord of the moors doth likewise and commandeth his folk not to mell betwixt them twain, for never yet had he found no knight that he had not conquered. </s>
<s>  they deal them great buffets on the helms, either upon other, in such sort that the sparks fly thereout and their swords are blunted. </s>
<s>  the buffets of messire gawain are heavier than the other's, for he dealeth them so mighty and horrible that the blood rayeth out from the lord of the moors by the mouth and the nose so that his habergeon is all bloody thereof and he may no more endure. </s>
<s>  thereupon he yieldeth him prisoner to messire gawain, that is right glad thereof and his live knights likewise. </s>
<s>  the lord of the moors goeth to his tent to alight, and messire gawain with him and alighteth. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain taketh the horse and saith to one of the knights, "keep this for me. </s>
<s> " and all the knights are repaired to their tents, and with one accord say they all that the knight of the red shield with the eagle of gold thereon hath done better than we, and they ask the lord of the moors whether he accordeth with them, and he saith "aye. </s>
<s> " " sir," saith he to messire gawain, "you, then, are the warden of this castle of camelot. </s>
<s> " "gramercy, lord!" saith messire gawain. </s>
<s>  he calleth the five knights and saith unto them: "lords, my will is that you be there on my behalf and that you shall safeguard the same by consent of the knights that are here present. </s>
<s> " "sir, right gladly do we agree thereto. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith messire gawain to the lord of the moors, "i give you moreover as my prisoner to the widow lady that harboured me last night. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith he, "this have you no right to do. </s>
<s>  assembly of tourney is not war. </s>
<s>  hence have you no right to imprison my body in castle, for well am i able to pay my ransom here. </s>
<s>  but tell me, what is your name?" "i am called gawain. </s>
<s> " "ha, messire gawain, many a time have i heard tell of you albeit never tofore have i seen you. </s>

<s>   so you would have of me gold or silver, thereof will i give you at your will. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith messire gawain, "gramercy! i consent freely to as much as you have said. </s>
<s> " messire gawain taketh leave and turneth him again toward the castle of camelot, and sendeth by a squire the horse of the lord of the moors to the daughter of the widow lady, that made great joy thereof. </s>
<s>  and the five knights drive before them the horses they have taken booty. </s>
<s>  whereof great also was the joy. </s>
<s>  no need to wonder whether messire gawain were well harboured that night at the castle. </s>
<s>  he recounted to the lady how the castle was in the keeping of these knights. </s>
<s>  when it came to morning-tide, messire gawain took leave and departed from the castle, but not before he had heard mass, for such was his custom. </s>
<s>  the widow lady and her daughter commend him to god, and the castle remaineth in better keeping than he had found it. </s>
<s>  branch iv. </s>
<s>  incipit. </s>
<s>  here beginneth another branch of the graal in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy ghost. </s>
<s>  title i. </s>
<s>  and the story is silent here of the mother of the good knight, and saith that messire gawain goeth so as god and adventure lead him toward the land of the rich king fisherman. </s>
<s>  and he entereth into a great forest, all armed, his shield at his neck and his spear in his hand. </s>
<s>  and he prayeth our lord that he counsel him of this holy errand he hath emprised so as that he may honourably achieve it. </s>
<s>  he rode until that he came at evensong to a hold that was in the midst of the forest. </s>
<s>  and it was compassed about of a great water, and had about it great clumps of trees so as that scarce with much pains might he espy the hall, that was right large. </s>
<s>  the river that compassed it about was water royal, for it lost not its right name nor its body as far as the sea. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain bethought him that it was the hold of a worshipful man, and draweth him thitherward to lodge. </s>
<s>  and as he drew anigh the bridge of the hold, he looketh and seeth a dwarf sitting on a high bench. </s>
<s>  he leapeth up: "messire gawain," saith he, "welcome may you be!" "fair, sweet friend," saith messire gawain, "god give you good adventure! you know me, then?" saith he. </s>
<s>  "well do i know you," saith the dwarf, "for i saw you at the tournament. </s>
<s>  at a better moment could you not have come hither, for my lord is not here. </s>
<s>  but you will find my lady, the fairest and most gentle and most courteous in the realm of logres, and as yet is she not of twenty years. </s>
<s> " "fair friend," saith messire gawain, "what name hath the lord of the hold?" "sir, he is called of little gomeret. </s>
<s>  i will go tell my lady that messire gawain is come, the good knight, and bid her make great joy. </s>
<s> " howbeit, messire gawain marvelleth much that the dwarf should make him such cheer, for many knaveries hath he found in many places within the bodies of many dwarfs. </s>
<s>  the dwarf is come into the chamber where the lady was. </s>
<s>  "now, haste, lady!" saith he, "make great joy, for messire gawain is come to harbour with you. </s>
<s> " "certes," saith she, "of this am i right glad and right sorry. </s>
<s>  glad, for that the good knight will lie here to-night, sorry, for that he is the knight that my lord most hateth in the world. </s>
<s>  wherefore he warneth me against him for love of him, for oftentimes hath he told me that never did messire gawain keep faith with dame nor damsel but he would have his will of them. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith the dwarf, "it is not true albeit it is so said. </s>
<s> " ii. </s>
<s>  thereupon messire gawain entereth into the courtyard and alighteth, and the lady cometh to meet him and saith to him: "may you be come to joy and good adventure. </s>
<s> " "lady," saith he, "may you also have honour and good adventure. </s>
<s> " the lady taketh him by the hand and leadeth him into the hall and maketh him be seated on a cushion of straw. </s>
<s>  and a squire leadeth his horse to stable. </s>
<s>  and the dwarf summoneth two other squires and doeth messire gawain be disarmed, and helpeth them right busily, and maketh fetch water to wash his hands and his face. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith the dwarf, "your fists are still all swollen of the buffets you gave and received at the tournament. </s>
<s> " messire gawain answered him nought. </s>
<s>  and the dwarf entereth into the chamber and bringeth a scarlet robe furred of ermine and maketh it be done on messire gawain. </s>
<s>  and meat was made ready and the table set, and the lady sate to eat. </s>
<s>  many a time looked he upon the lady by reason of her great beauty,  had he been minded to trust to his heart and his eyes, he would have all to-changed his purpose. </s>
<s>  but so straitly was his heart bound up, and so quenched the desires thereof, that nought would he allow himself to think upon that might turn to wickedness, for the sake of the high pilgrimage he had emprised. </s>
<s>  rather 'gan he withdraw his eyes from looking at the lady, that was held to be of passing great beauty. </s>
<s>  after meat messire gawain's bed was made, and he apparelled himself to lie down. </s>
<s>  the lady bade him god give him good adventure, and he made answer the like. </s>
<s>  when the lady was in her chamber, the dwarf said to messire gawain: "sir, i will lie before you, so as to keep you company until you be asleep. </s>
<s> " "gramercy," saith he, "and god allow me at some time to reward you of the service. </s>
<s> " the dwarf laid himself down on a mattress before messire gawain, and when he saw that he slept, he ariseth as quickly as he may, and cometh to a boat that was on the river that ran behind the hall, and entereth thereinto and roweth up-stream of the river. </s>
<s>  and he cometh to a fishery, where was a right fair hall on a little eyot enclosed by a marshy arm of the river. </s>
<s>  the jealous knight was come thither for disport, and lay in the midst of the hall upon a couch. </s>
<s>  the dwarf cometh forth of his boat thereinto, and lighteth a great candle in his fist and cometh before the couch. </s>
<s>  "what ho, there!" saith the dwarf, "are you sleeping?" and the other waketh up sore startled, and asketh what is the matter and wherefore is he come? "in god's name," saith he, "you sleep not so much at your ease as doth messire gawain!" "how know you that?" saith he. </s>
<s>  "well know i," saith the dwarf, "for i left him but now in your hall, and methinketh he and your lady are abed together arm to arm. </s>
<s> " "how?" saith he, "i forbade her she should ever harbour messire gawain. </s>
<s> " "in faith," said the dwarf, "she hath made him greater cheer than ever saw i her make to none other! but haste you and come, for great fear have i lest he carry her away!" "by my head!" saith the knight. </s>
<s>  "i will go not, howsoever it be! but she shall pay for it, even though she go!" "then of wrong will it be!" saith the dwarf, "as methinketh!" iii. </s>
<s>  messire gawain lay in the hall that was ware of nought of this. </s>
<s>  he seeth that day hath broken fair and clear, and ariseth up. </s>
<s>  the lady cometh to the door of the hall and seeth not the dwarf, whereby well she understandeth his treachery. </s>
<s>  she saith to messire gawain, "sir, for god's sake have pity upon me, for the dwarf hath betrayed me! and you withdraw yourself forth of our forest and help not to rescue me from the smart that my lord will make me suffer, great sin will you have thereof. </s>
<s>  for well know you. </s>
<s>  that of right ought i not to be held guilty toward my lord nor toward any other, for aught that you have done toward me or i toward you. </s>
<s> " "you say true," saith messire gawain. </s>
<s>  thereupon is he armed, and taketh leave of the lady and issueth forth of the fair hold and setteth him in an ambush in the forest nigh thereby. </s>
<s>  straightway behold the jealous knight where he cometh, he and his dwarf. </s>
<s>  he entereth into the hall. </s>
<s>  the lady cometh to meet him. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith she, "welcome may you be!" "and you," saith he, "shame and evil adventure may you have, as the most disloyal dame on live, for that this night have you harboured in my hostel and in my bed him that most have i warned you against!" "sir," saith she, "in your hostel did i harbour him, but never hath your bed been shamed by me, nor never shall be!" "you lie!" saith he, "like a false woman!" he armeth himself all incontinent and maketh his horse be armed, then maketh the lady go down and despoil her to her shirt, that crieth him mercy right sweetly and weepeth. </s>
<s>  he mounteth his horse and taketh his shield and his spear, and maketh the lady be taken of the dwarf by her tresses and maketh her be led before him into the forest. </s>
<s>  and he bideth above a pool where was a spring, and maketh her enter into the water that flowed forth full cold, and gathereth saplings in the forest for rods and beginneth to smite and beat her across upon her back and her breast in such sort that the stream from the spring was all bloody therewithal. </s>
<s>  and she began to cry out right loud, until at last messire gawain heareth her and draweth forth of the ambush wherein he was, and cometh thitherward a great gallop. </s>
<s>  "by my faith," saith the dwarf, "look you here where messire gawain cometh!" "by my faith," saith the knight, "now know i well that nought is there here but treachery, and that the matter is well proven!" by this time, messire gawain is come, and saith: "avoid, sir knight! wherefore slay you the best lady and most loyal that ever have i seen? never tofore have i found lady that hath done me so much honour, and this ought you to be well pleased to know, for neither in her bearing, nor in her speech, nor in herself found i nought save all goodness only. </s>
<s>  wherefore i pray you of franchise and of love that you forbear your wrath and that you set her forth of the water. </s>
<s>  and so will i swear on all the sacred hallows in this chapel that never did i beseech her of evil nor wantonness nor never had i no desire thereof. </s>
<s> " the knight was full of great wrath when he saw that messire gawain had not gone his way thence, and an anguish of jealousy burneth him heart and body and overburdeneth him of folly and outrage, and messire gawain that is still before him moveth him to yet further transgression. </s>
<s>  natheless, for the fear that he hath of him he speaketh to him: "messire gawain," saith he, "i will set her forth thence on one condition, that you joust at me and i at you,  so you conquer me, quit shall she be of misdoing and of blame, but and if i shall conquer you, she shall be held guilty herein. </s>
<s>  such shall be the judgment in this matter. </s>
<s> " "i ask no better," saith messire gawain. </s>
<s>  iv. </s>
<s>  thereupon, the knight biddeth the dwarf make set the lady forth of the pool of the spring and make her sit in a launde whereas they were to joust. </s>
<s>  the knight draweth him back the better to take his career, and messire gawain cometh as fast as his horse may carry him toward marin the jealous. </s>
<s>  and when marin seeth him coming, he avoideth his buffet and lowereth his spear and cometh to his wife that was right sore distraught, and wept as she that suffered blameless, and smote her through, out the body and slew her, and then turneth him again so fast as his horse might carry him toward his hold. </s>
<s>  messire gawak seeth the damsel dead and the dwarf that fleeth full speed after his lord. </s>
<s>  he overtaketh him and trampleth him under his horses feet so that he bursteth his belly in the midst. </s>
<s>  then goeth he toward the hold, for he thinketh to enter therein. </s>
<s>  but he found the bridge shut up and the gate barred. </s>
<s>  and marin crieth out upon him. </s>
<s>  "this shame and misadventure hath befallen me along of you, but you shall pay for it yet and i may live. </s>
<s> " messire gawain hath no mind to argue with him, but rather draweth him back and cometh again to where the lady lay dead, and setteth her on the neck of his horse all bleeding, and then beareth her to a chapel that was without the entrance of the hold. </s>
<s>  then he alighted and laid her within the chapel as fairly as most he might, as he that was sore grieved and wrathful thereof. </s>
<s>  after that, he shut the door of the chapel again as he that was afeared of the body for the wild beasts, and bethought him that one should come thither to set her in her shroud and bury her after that he was departed. </s>
<s>  v. </s>
<s>  thereupon messire gawain departeth, sore an-angered, for it seemed him that never had no thing tofore befallen him that weighed so heavy on his heart. </s>
<s>  and he rideth thoughtful and down-cast through the forest, and seeth a knight coming along the way he came. </s>
<s>  and in strange fashion came he. </s>
<s>  he bestrode his horse backwards in right outlandish guise, face to tail, and he had his horse's reins right across his breast and the base of his shield bore he topmost and the chief bottommost, and his spear upside down and his habergeon and chausses of iron trussed about his neck. </s>
<s>  he seeth messire gawain coming beside the forest, that hath great wonderment of him when he seeth him. </s>
<s>  natheless, when they draw nigh, he turneth him not to look at messire gawain, but crieth to him aloud: "gentle knight, you that come there, for god's sake do me no hurt, for i am the knight coward. </s>
<s> " "by god," saith messire gawain, "you look not like a man to whom any ought to do hurt!"  but for the heaviness of his heart and the sore wrath that he had, he would have laughed at his bearing with a right good will. </s>

<s>  they were a good fifteen knights armed. </s>
<s>  just as they were about to issue out of the castle, behold you forthwith two keepers of the forest where they come, both twain of them smitten through the body. </s>

<s>  and on his right hand was there a narrow pathway that seemed him to be haunted of folk. </s>
<s>  thitherward goeth he, for that he seeth the sun waxeth low, and findeth in the thick of the forest a great chapel, and without was a right fair manor. </s>
<s>  before the chapel was an orchard enclosed of a wooden fence that was scarce so high as a tall man. </s>

<s>  saw you ever so fair a child his age?" "never," saith messire gawain. </s>
<s>  they go into the orchard to sit, for the evening was fair and calm. </s>
<s>  he maketh disarm him, and thereupon the damsel bringeth him a surcoat of right rich silk furred of ermine. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain looketh at the child that rode upon the lion right fainly. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith the hermit, "none durst guard him or be master over him save this child only, and yet the lad is not more than six years of age. </s>
<s>  sir, he is of right noble lineage, albeit he is the son of the most cruel man and most felon that is. </s>

<s>  never sithence that his mother was dead would not the lad be with his father, for well knoweth he that he slew her of wrong. </s>

<s>  but so much may i well tell you that he is in this forest, but i ought not to learn you of the place more at large, nor ought i to do any one thing that may be against my master's will. </s>
<s> " messire gawain seeth that the squire is of passing comeliness and seeth him forthwith bow his head toward the ground and the tears fall from his eyes. </s>
<s>  thereupon he asketh what aileth him. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith he, "never may i have joy until such time as i be entered into a hermitage to save my soul. </s>
<s>  for the greatest sin that any man may do have i wrought. </s>
<s>  for i have slain my mother that was a queen, for this only that she told me i should not be king after my father's death, for that she would make me monk or clerk, and that my other brother, who is younger-born than i, should have the kingdom. </s>
<s>  when my father knew that i had slain my mother, he withdrew himself into this forest, and made a hermitage and renounced his kingdom. </s>

<s>  he looketh from without the entrance under a little tree and seeth there sitting one of the seemliest men that he had ever seen of his age. </s>
<s>  and he was clad as a hermit, his head white and no hair on his face, and he held his hand to his chin, and made a squire hold a destrier right fair and strong and tail, and a shield with a sun thereon. </s>
<s>  and he was looking at a habergeon and chausses of iron that he had made bring before him. </s>
<s>  and when he seeth messire gawain he dresseth him over against him and saith: "fair sir," saith he, "ride gently and make no noise, for no need have we of worse than that we have. </s>

<s>  for right fainly would i have besought you to harbour had i not good cause to excuse me, but a knight lieth within yonder sick, that is held for the best knight in the world. </s>
<s>  wherefore fain would i he should have no knight come within this close, for and if he should rise, as sick as he is, none might prevent him nor hold him back, but presently he should arm him and mount on his horse and joust at you or any other. </s>
<s>  and so he were here, well might we be the worse thereof. </s>
<s>  and therefore do i keep him so close and quiet within yonder, for that i would not have him see you nor none other, for and he were so soon to die, sore loss would it be to the world. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith messire gawain, "what name hath he?" "sir," saith he, "he hath made him of himself, and therefore do i call him par-lui-fer, of dearness and love. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith messire gawain, "may it not be in any wise that i may see him?" "sir," saith the hermit, "i have told you plainly that nowise may it not be. </s>

<s> " hereof is messire gawain right sorrowful that he may not speak to the knight. </s>

<s>  and messire abideth without and knoweth not of a truth whether it be the son of the widow lady, for many good men there be of one lineage. </s>
<s>  he departeth all abashed and entereth again into the forest. </s>
<s>  the history telleth not all the journeys that he made. </s>
<s>  rather, i tell you in brief words that he wandered so far by lands and kingdoms that he found a right fair land and a rich, and a castle seated in the midst thereof. </s>

<s>  and for that adam was the first man is he called king, for he was our earthly father, and his wife queen. </s>

<s>  of these three manner of folk is the world stablished. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith messire gawain, "i marvel of the castle of the black hermit, there where the heads were all taken from her, and the damsel told me that the good knight should cast them all forth when he should come. </s>

<s> " "well know you," saith the priest, "that on account of the apple that eve gave adam to eat, all went to hell alike, the good as well as the evil, and to cast his people forth from hell did god become man, and cast these souls forth from hell of his bounty and of his puissance. </s>

<s> " "sir," saith the good man, "each day full bald behoveth her to be, ever since bald she became when the good king fell into languishment on account of the knight whom he harboured that made not the demand. </s>

<s>  "certes," saith messire gawain, "it was sore mischance for me that i should see him yesterday before the castle where the knights pass by, and speak to him and ask him his name, but he besought me that i should not ask him his name until such time as he should ask me mine. </s>
<s>  and with that he departed from me and entered into the forest, and i came hitherward. </s>

<s> " "sir," saith the hermit, "he is so close and wary a knight, that he is fain never to waste a word, neither will he make false semblant to any nor speak word that he would not should be heard, nor do shame of his body to his knowledge, nor carnal sin, for virgin and chaste is he and doth never outrage to any. </s>

<s>  this high record saith that messire gawain hath wandered so far that he is come into the red launde whereas the assembly of knights should be held. </s>
<s>  he looketh and seeth the tents pitched and the knights coming from all quarters. </s>
<s>  the most part were already armed within and before their tents. </s>
<s>  messire gawain looketh everywhere, thinking to see the knight he seeketh, but seemeth him he seeth him not, for no such shield seeth he as he beareth. </s>
<s>  all abashed is he thereof, for he hath seen all the tents and looked at all the arms. </s>
<s>  but the knight is not easy to recognise, for he hath changed his arms, and nigh enough is he to messire gawain, albeit you may well understand that he knoweth it not. </s>
<s>  and the tournament assembleth from all parts, and the divers fellowships come the one against other, and the melly of either upon other as they come together waxeth sore and marvellous. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain searcheth the ranks to find the knight, albeit when he meeteth knight in his way he cannot choose but do whatsoever a knight may do of arms, and yet more would he have done but for his fainness to seek out the knight. </s>

<s>  the knight that messire gawain seeketh is not at the head of the fellowships, but in the thickest of the press, and such feats of arms doth he that more may no knight do, and smiteth down the knights about him, that flee from him even as the deer-hound fleeth from the lion. </s>
<s>  "by my faith," saith messire gawain, "sith that they have lied to me about the knight, i will seek him no more this day, but forget my discontent as best i may until evening. </s>
<s> " he seeth the knight, but knoweth him not, for he had a white shield and cognisances of the same. </s>
<s>  and messire gawain cometh to him as fast as his horse may carry him, and the knight toward messire gawain. </s>
<s>  so passing stoutly they come together that they pierce their shields below the boss. </s>
<s>  their spears were so tough that they break not, and they draw them forth and come together again so strongly that the spears wherewith they smote each other amidst the breast were bended so that they unriveted the holdfasts of their shields, and they lost their stirrups, and the reins fly from their fists, and they stagger against the back saddlebows, and the horses stumbled so as that they all but fell. </s>
<s>  they straighten them in saddle and stirrup, and catch hold upon their reins, and then come together again, burning with wrath and fury like lions, and either smiteth on other with their spears that may endure no longer, for the shafts are all to-frushed as far as the fists in such sort that they that look on marvel them much how it came to pass that the points had not pierced their bodies. </s>

<s>  and never did messire gawain depart from hostel wherein he had lien, but he first heard mass before he went if so he might, nor never found he dame nor damsel discounselled whereof he had not pity, nor did he ever churlishness to other knight, nor said nor thought it, and he came, as you have heard, of the most holy lineage of josephus and the good king fisherman. </s>

<s>  they have much pains to part them asunder, and then the melly beginneth again on all sides, and the evening cometh on that parteth them at last. </s>
<s>  and on this wise the assembly lasted for two days. </s>

<s>  but they judged that for the time that messire gawain had joined therein he had not done worse than the other knight. </s>
<s>  the damsel seeketh the knight of the white shield among the knights and throughout all the tents, but cannot find him, for already hath he departed. </s>
<s>  she cometh to messire gawain and saith: "sir, sith that i find not the knight of the white shield, you are he that behoveth avenge the knight that lieth dead in the litter. </s>

<s>  "how know you that?" "i know it well," saith she, "for that in the house of king fisherman did the graal appear unto him for the goodness of his knighthood and the goodness of his heart and for the chastity of his body. </s>

<s>  "sir, i come from the forest of the robbers that won in this forest wherethrough you have to pass. </s>
<s>  they have chased me a full league welsh to slay me, but they would not follow me further for a knight that they have beset in one of their holds, that hath done them right sore mischief, for he hath hanged four of their knights and slain one, as well as the fairest damsel that was in the kingdom. </s>
<s>  but right well had she deserved the death for that she harboured knights with fair semblant and showed them much honour, and afterward brought about their death and destruction, between herself and a dwarf that she hath, that slew the knights. </s>
<s> " "and know you who is the knight?" saith perceval. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith the knight, "not i, for no leisure had i to ask him, for sorer need had i to flee than to stay. </s>
<s>  but i tell you that on account of the meat that failed him in the hold wherein they beset him, he issued forth raging like a lion, nor would he have suffered himself be shut up so long but for two wounds that he had upon his body. </s>
<s>  for he cared not to issue forth of the house until such time as they were healed, and also for that he had no horse. </s>

<s> " "sirs," saith the knight, "perceval and lancelot, by the counsel of messire gawain, granted the treasure to the two damsels, sisters to the poor knight of the waste castle, whereupon let them send for joseus the hermit and bid him guard the treasure until they shall come hither. </s>

<s>  he drew his sword and therewith cut off lohot's head, and took the head and the body and set them in a coffin of stone. </s>
<s>  after that he hacked his shield to pieces with his sword, that he should not be recognised. </s>
<s>  then came he to the giant that lay dead, and so cut oft his head, that was right huge and hideous, and hung it at his fore saddle-bow. </s>
<s>  then went he to the court of king arthur and presented it to him. </s>
<s>  the king made great joy thereof and all they of the court, and the king made broad his lands right freely for that he believed kay had spoken true. </s>

<s> " "sir," saith perceval, "this is sore pity of the king's son, that he is dead in such manner, for i have heard witness that he ever waxed more and more in great chivalry,  so the king knew thereof, kay the seneschal, that is not well-loved of all folk, would lose the court for ever more, or his life, so he might be taken, and this would be only right and just. </s>

<s>  at the entrance to the gateway of the castle were two men made of copper by art of nicromancy, and they held two great mallets of iron, and they busied themselves striking the one after the other, and so strongly they struck that nought mortal is there in the world that might pass through amongst their blows but should be all to-crushed thereby. </s>

<s>  he passeth a bridge that was within the entry, and cometh nigh them that guard the gate. </s>
<s>  a voice began to cry aloud above the gate that he might go forward safely, and that he need have no care for the men of copper that guarded the gate nor be affrighted of their blows, for no power had they to harm such a knight as was he. </s>

<s>  he cometh anigh the serjeants of copper, and they cease to strike at once, and hold their iron mallets quite still. </s>

<s>  perceval was therewithin, but none was there that spake unto him, for, so intent were they upon adoring the bull that, and any had been minded to slay them what time they were yet worshipping the same, they would have allowed him so to do, and would have thought that they were saved thereby. </s>
<s>  and save this had they none other believe in the world. </s>
<s>  it was not of custom within there to be armed, for the entrance of the fortress was so strong that none might enter but by their will and commandment, save it were the pleasure of our lord god. </s>
<s>  and the devil that had deceived them, and in whom they believed, gave them such great abundance therewithin of everything they could desire, that nought in the world was there whereof they lacked. </s>
<s>  when he perceived that they held no discourse with him, he draweth himself on one side by a great hall, and so called them around him. </s>
<s>  the more part came thither, but some of them came not. </s>
<s>  the voice warneth him that he make them all pass through the entrance of the gateway there where the men with the iron mallets are, for there may he well prove which of them are willing to believe in god and which not. </s>
<s>  the good knight draweth his sword and surroundeth them all and maketh them all go in common before him, would they or nould they. </s>
<s>  and they that would not go willingly and kindly might be sure that they should receive their death. </s>
<s>  he made them pass through the entrance there where the serjeants of copper were striking great blows with their iron mallets. </s>
<s>  of one thousand five hundred that there were, scarce but thirteen were not all slain and brained of the iron mallets. </s>
<s>  but the thirteen had firmly bound their belief in our lord, wherefore the serjeants took no heed of them. </s>
<s>  xiii. </s>
<s>  the evil spirit that was in the bull of copper issued forth thereof as it had been lightning from heaven, and the bull of copper melted all in a heap so as that nought remained in that place thereof. </s>
<s>  then the thirteen that remained sent for a hermit of the forest and so made themselves be held up and baptized. </s>
<s>  after that, they took the bodies of the misbelievers and made cast them into a water that is called the river of hell. </s>
<s>  this water runneth into the sea, so say many that have seen it, and there where it spendeth itself in the sea is it most foul and most horrible, so that scarce may ship pass that is not wrecked. </s>

<s>  nor never might none enter with them thereinto but was slain and crushed save he firmly believed in god. </s>

<s>  fair, sweet nephew," saith the hermit, "these twelve hounds that bayed in the beast are the jews that god had fed, and that were born in the law that he established, nor never would they believe on him, nor love him, but rather crucified him and tore his body after the shamefullest sort they might, but in no wise might they destroy his flesh. </s>

<s>  "lords," saith the king, "where may we be able to alight to- night?" "sir, we know not, for this forest is fight wearisome. </s>

<s>  lancelot went into the chamber to see whether he spake true, and felt the men that lay dead, and groped among them from head to head and felt that there was a great heap of them there, and came back and sate at the fire all laughing. </s>

<s>  while they were talking thus, behold you a damsel that cometh into the dwelling on foot and all alone, and she cometh lamenting right grievously. </s>

<s>  "fair lord god," saith she, "is he there within through whom i am to escape from this great dolour?" the knights hearken to her with great wonderment. </s>
<s>  they look and see her enter within the door, and her kirtle was all torn with thorns and briars in the forest. </s>
<s>  her feet were all bleeding for that she was unshod. </s>
<s>  she had a face of exceeding great beauty. </s>
<s>  she carried the half of a dead man, and cast it into the chamber with the others. </s>

<s>  "ha, god !" saith she, "i am quit of my penance! sir," saith she, "welcome may you be, you and your company!" lancelot looketh at her in wonderment. </s>
<s>  "damsel," saith he, "are you a thing on god's behalf?" "certes, sir," saith she, "yea! nor be you adread of nought! i am the damsel of the castle of beards, that was wont to deal with knights so passing foully as you have seen. </s>
<s>  you did away the toll that was levied on the knights that passed by, and you lay in the castle that demanded it of them that passed through the demesne thereof. </s>

<s>  you returned not, for that you saw not the graal. </s>
<s>  for the shame that i did to knights was this penance laid upon me in this forest and this manor, to last until such time as you should come. </s>
<s>  for the cruelty i did them was sore grievous, for never was knight brought to me but i made his nose be cut off or his eyes thrust out, and some were there as you saw that had their feet or their hands stricken off. </s>
<s>  now have i paid full dear thereof since, for needs must i carry into this chamber all the knights that are slain in this forest, and within this manor must i cast them according to the custom thereof, alone, without company. </s>
<s>  and this knight that i carried in but now hath lain so long in the forest that wild beasts have eaten half of his body. </s>

<s>  but one knight that came within yonder by chance, the first night i came hither, in like manner as you have come, made a circle round me with his sword, and i sate within it as soon as i saw them coming, and so had i no dread of them, for i had in remembrance the saviour of the world and his passing sweet mother. </s>
<s>  and you will do the same, and you believe me herein, for these are knights fiends. </s>
<s> " lancelot draweth his sword and maketh a great circle round the house-place, and they were within. </s>
<s>  v. </s>
<s>  thereupon, behold you the knights that come through the forest with such a rushing as it seemed they would rend it all up by the roots. </s>

<s>  "sir," saith the damsel, "take heed that you go not forth of the circle, for you will be in sore jeopardy of death, for well you see what evil folk be these. </s>
<s> " lancelot was nor minded to hold himself back, but that he would go toward them sword drawn, and they run upon him on all sides, but he defendeth him stoutly and smiteth the burning firebrands so that he maketh red-hot charcoal fly, and thrusreth his sword amidst their faces. </s>
<s>  king arthur and messire gawain leap up to help lancelot and smite upon these evil folk and cut them limb from limb, and they bellow like fiends so that the whole forest resoundeth thereof. </s>

<s>  they marvel right sore what this may be, and say that such hostel is right grievous. </s>
<s>  vi. </s>
<s>  when they had put them all to the worse, they sate them down again and rested. </s>
<s>  but scarce were they seated or ever another rout of yet blacker folk came about them, and they bare spears burning and flaming, and many of them carried dead knights that they had slain in the forest, and dropped them in the midst of the house, and then bid the damsel carry and set them with the others. </s>
<s>  howbeit, she answereth that she is quit of their commandment and service, nor no longer is forced to do nought for them sith that she hath done her penance. </s>
<s>  they thrust forward their spears toward the king and the two knights, as though they were come to avenge their companions. </s>
<s>  but they all three leapt up together and attacked them right stoutly. </s>
<s>  but this rout was greater and of knights more hideous. </s>
<s>  they began to press the king and his knights hard, and they might not put them to the worse as they did the others. </s>
<s>  and while they were thus in the thickest of the conflict, they heard the stroke of a bell sounding, and forthwith the knight fiends departed and hurried away a great pace. </s>
<s>  "lords," saith the damsel, "had this sound not been heard, scarce might you have endured, for yet another huge rout of this folk was coming in such sort as that none might have withstood them, and this sound have i heard every night, whereby my life hath been saved. </s>
<s> " vii. </s>
<s>  josephus telleth us that as at this time was there no bell neither in greater britain nor in lesser. </s>

<s>  the damsel took leave of them and so departed. </s>
<s>  as they came forth of the hold, they met three hermits that told them they were going to search for the bodies that were in this manor so that they might bury them in a waste chapel that was hard by, for such knights had lain there as that henceforward the haunting of the evil folk would be stayed in such sort as that they would have no more power to do hurt to any, wherefore they would set therewithin a worshipful hermit that should build up the place in holiness for the service of god. </s>
<s>  the king was right joyful thereof, and told them that it had been too perilous. </s>
<s>  they parted from the hermits and entered into a forest, nor was there never a day so long as king arthur was on pilgrimage, so saith the history, but he heard the sound of one single bell every hour, whereof he was right glad. </s>
<s>  he bade messire gawain and lancelot that they should everywhere conceal his name, and that they should call him not lord but comrade. </s>
<s>  they yielded him his will, and prayed to our lord that he would guide and lead them to such a castle and such a hostel as that they might be lodged honourably therein. </s>
<s>  they rode on until evening drew nigh, and they found a right fair hold in the forest, whereinto they entered and alighted. </s>
<s>  the damsel of the hold came to meet them and made them right great cheer, then made them be disarmed, afterward bringeth them right rich robes to wear. </s>
<s>  she looketh at lancelot and knoweth him again. </s>
<s>  viii. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith she, "you had once, on a day that is past, right great pity of me, and saved me my honour, whereof am i in great unhappiness. </s>
<s>  but better love i to suffer misease in honour, than to have plenty and abundance in shame or reproach, for shame endureth, but sorrow is soon overpassed. </s>
<s> " thereupon behold you the knight of the hold, whither he cometh from shooting in the forest and maketh carry in full great plenty venison of deer and wild boar. </s>
<s>  he alighted to greet the knights, and began to laugh when he saw lancelot. </s>
<s>  "by my head," saith he, "i know you well for you disappointed me of the thing i best loved in the world, and made me marry this damsel that never yet had joy of me, nor never shall have. </s>
<s> " "faith, sir," saith lancelot, "you will do your pleasure therein, for she is yours. </s>
<s>  truth it is that i made you marry her, for you were fain to do her a disgrace and a shame in such sort that her kinsfolk would have had shame of her. </s>
<s> " "by my head," saith the knight, "the damsel that i loved before loveth you no better hereof, nay, rather, fain would she procure your vexation and your hurt and your shame if she may, and great power hath she in this forest. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith lancelot, "i have sithence spoken to her and she to me, and so hath she told me her will and her wish. </s>
<s> " thereupon the knight bade the knights take water, and the lady taketh the basins and presenteth water to the knights. </s>
<s>  "avoid, damsel," saith the king, "take it away! never, please god, shall it befall that we should accept such service from you. </s>
<s> " "by my head," saith the knight, "but so must you needs do, for other than she shall not serve you to-night in this matter, or otherwise shall you not eat with me this night there within. </s>
<s> " ix. </s>
<s>  lancelot understandeth that the knight is not overburdened of courtesy, and he seeth the table garnished of good meat, and bethinketh him he will not do well to lose such ease, for misease enough had they the night before. </s>
<s>  he maketh the king take water of the lady, and the same service did she for all of them. </s>
<s>  the knight biddeth them be seated. </s>
<s>  the king would have made the lady sit beside him at the table, but the knight said that there she should not sit. </s>
<s>  she goeth to sit among the squires as she was wont to do. </s>
<s>  the knights are sorry enough thereof, but they durst not gainsay the will of her lord. </s>
<s>  when they had eaten, the knight said to lancelot, "now may you see what she hath gained of me by your making me take her perforce, nor never, so help me god, so long as i live shall she be honoured otherwise by me, for so have i promised her that i love far more. </s>
<s> " "sir," saith lancelot, "to my thinking you do ill herein and a sin, and meseemeth you should have great blame thereof of them that know it, and may your churlishness be your own, for nought thereof take i to myself. </s>
<s> " x. </s>
<s>  lancelot telleth the king and messire gawain that were he not lodged in his hostel, and had him outside of the hold, he would willingly have set the blood of his body on it but he would have handled him in such sort as that the lady should be maintained in greater honour, either by force or by prayer, in like manner as he did when he made him marry her. </s>
<s>  they were right well lodged the night and lay in the hold until the morrow, when they departed thence, and rode right busily on their journeys until they came into a very different l scarce inhabited of any folk, and found a little castle in a combe. </s>
<s>  they came thitherward and saw that the enclosure of the castle was fallen down into an abysm, so that none might approach it on that side, but it had a right fair gateway and a door tall and wide whereby one entered. </s>
<s>  they beheld a chapel that was right fair and rich, and below was a great ancient hall. </s>
<s>  they saw a priest appear in the midst of the castle, bald and old, that had come forth of the chapel. </s>
<s>  they are come thither and alighted, and asked the priest what the castle was, and he told them that it was the great tintagel. </s>
<s>  "and how is this ground all caved in about the castle?" "sir," saith the priest, "i will tell you. </s>
<s>  sir," saith he, "king uther pendragon, that was father of king arthur, held a great court and summoned all his barons. </s>
<s>  the king of this castle that then was here was named gorlois. </s>
<s>  he went to the court and took his wife with him, that was named ygerne, and she was the fairest dame in any kingdom. </s>
<s>  king uther sought acquaintance of her for her great beauty, and regarded her and honoured her more than all the others of his court. </s>
<s>  king gorlois departed thence and made the queen come back to this castle for the dread that he had of king uther pendragon. </s>
<s>  king uther was very wroth with him, and commanded him to send back the queen his wife. </s>
<s>  king godois said that he would not. </s>
<s>  thereupon king uther pendragon defied him, and then laid siege about this castle where the queen was. </s>
<s>  king gorlois was gone to seek for succour. </s>
<s>  king uther pendragon had merlin with him of whom you have heard tell, that was so crafty. </s>
<s>  he made him be changed into the semblance of king gorlois, so that he entered there within by merlin's art and lay that night with the queen, and so begat king arthur in a great hall that was next to the enclosure there where this abysm is. </s>
<s>  and for this sin hath the ground sunken in on this wise. </s>
<s> " he cometh with them toward the chapel that was right fair, and had a right rich sepulchre therein. </s>
<s>  "lords, in this sepulchre was placed the body of merlin, but never mought it be set inside the chapel, wherefore perforce it remained outside. </s>
<s>  and know of a very truth that the body lieth not within the sepulchre, for, so soon as it was set therein, it was taken out and snatched away, either on god's behalf or the enemy's, but which we know not. </s>
<s> " xi. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith king arthur, "and what became of king gorlois?" "sir. </s>
<s> " saith he, "the king slew him on the morrow of the night he lay with his wife, and so forthwith espoused queen ygerne, and in such manner as i tell you was king arthur conceived in sin that is now the best king in the world. </s>
<s> " king arthur hath heard this as concerning his birth that he knew not, and is a little shamed thereof and confounded on account of messire gawain and lancelot. </s>
<s>  he himself marvelleth much thereof, and much it misliketh him that the priest hath said so much. </s>
<s>  they lay the night in the hold, and so departed thence on the morrow when they had heard mass. </s>
<s>  lancelot and messire gawain, that thought they knew the forest, found the land so changed and different that they knew not whither they were become, and such an one as should come into the land that had been king fisherman's, and he should come again another time within forty days, should not find the castle within a year. </s>
<s>  xii. </s>
<s>  josephus telleth us that the semblances of the islands changed themselves by reason of the divers adventures that by the pleasure of god befell therein, and that the quest of adventures would not have pleased the knights so well and they had not found them so different. </s>
<s>  for, when they had entered into a forest or an island where they had found any adventure, and they came there another time, they found holds and castles and adventures of another kind, so that their toils and travails might not weary them, and also for that god would that the land should be conformed to the new law. </s>
<s>  and they were the knights that had more toil and travail in seeking adventures than all the knights of the world before them, and in holding to that whereof they had made covenant. </s>
<s>  nor of no court of no king in the world went forth so many good knights as went forth from the court of king arthur, and but that god loved them so much, never might they have endured such toil and travail as they did from day to day. </s>
<s>  for without fait, good knights were they, and good knights not only to deal hard buffets, but rather in that they were loyal and true, and had faith in the saviour of the world and his sweet mother, and therefore dreaded shame and loved honour. </s>
<s>  king arthur goeth on his way and messire gawain and lancelot with him, and they pass through many strange countries, and so enter into a great forest. </s>
<s>  lancelot called to remembrance the knight that he had slain in the waste city whither behoved him to go, and knew well that the day whereon he should come was drawing nigh. </s>
<s>  he told king arthur as much, and then said, that and he should go not, he would belie his covenant. </s>
<s>  they rode until they came to a cross where the ways forked. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith lancelot, "behoveth me go to acquit me of my pledge, and i go in great adventure and peril of death, nor know i whether i may live at all thereafter, for i slew the knight, albeit i was right sorry thereof, but or ever i slew him, i had to swear that i would go set my head in the like jeopardy as he had set his. </s>
<s>  now the day draweth nigh that i must go thither, for i am unwilling to fail of my covenant, whereof i should be blamed,  so god grant me to escape therefrom, i will follow you speedily. </s>
<s> " the king embraceth him and kisseth him at parting and messire gawain also, and they pray god preserve his body and his life, and that they may see him again ere it be long. </s>
<s>  lancelot would willingly have sent salute to the queen had he durst, for she lay nearer his heart than aught beside, but he would not that the king nor messire gawain should misdeem of the love they might carry to their kinswoman. </s>
<s>  the love is so rooted in his heart that he may not leave it, into what peril soever he may go. </s>
<s>  rather, he prayeth god every day as sweetly as he may, that he save the queen, and that he may deliver his body from this jeopardy. </s>
<s>  he hath ridden until that he cometh at the hour of noon into the waste city, and findeth the city empty as it was the first time he was there. </s>
<s>  xiii. </s>
<s>  in the city wherein lancelot had arrived were many waste houses and rich palaces fallen down. </s>
<s>  he had scarce entered within the city when he heard a great cry and lamentation of dames and damsels, but he knew not on which side it was, and they say: "ha, god, how hath the knight betrayed us that slew the knight, inasmuch as he returneth not! this day is the day come that he ought to redeem his pledge! never again ought any to put trust in knight, for that he cometh not! the others that came hither before him have failed us, and so will he also for dread of death. </s>
<s>  for he smote off the head of the comeliest knight that was in this kingdom and the best, wherefore ought he also to have his own smitten off, but good heed taketh he to save it if he may!" thus spake the damsels. </s>
<s>  lancelot much marvelled where they might be, for nought could he espy of them, albeit he cometh before the palace, there where he slew the knight. </s>
<s>  he alighteth, then maketh fast his horse's reins to a ring that was fixed in the mounting-stage of marble. </s>
<s>  scarce hath he done so, when a knight alighteth, tall and comely and strong and deliver, and he was clad in a short close-fitted jerkin of silk, and held the axe in his hand wherewith lancelot had smitten off the head of the other knight, and he came sharpening it on a whetstone to cut the better. </s>
<s>  lancelot asketh him, "what will you do with this axe?" "by my head," saith the knight, "that shall you know in such sort as my brother knew when you cut off his head, so i may speed of my business. </s>
<s> " "how?" saith lancelot, "will you slay me then?" "that shall you know," saith he, "or ever you depart hence. </s>
<s>  have you not loyally promised hereof that you would set your head in the same jeopardy as the knight set his, whom you slew without defence? and no otherwise may you depart therefrom. </s>
<s>  wherefore now come forward without delay and kneel down and stretch your neck even as my brother did, and so will i smite off your head,  if you do nor this of your own good will, you shall soon find one that shall make you do it perforce, were you twenty knights as good as you are one. </s>
<s>  but well i know that you have not come hither for this, but only to fulfil your pledge, and that you will raise no contention herein. </s>
<s> " lancelot thinketh to die, and is minded to abide by that he hath in covenant without fail, wherefore he lieth down on the ground as it were on a cross, and crieth mercy of god. </s>
<s>  he mindeth him of the queen, and crieth god of mercy and saith, "ha, lady" saith he, "never shall i see you more!  might i have seen you yet once again before i die, exceeding great comfort had it been to me, and my soul would have departed from me more at ease. </s>
<s>  but this, that never shall i see you more, as now it seemeth me, troubleth me more than the death whereby behoveth me to die, for die one must when one hath lived long enough. </s>
<s>  but faithfully do i promise you that my love shall fail you not yet, and never shall it be but that my soul shall love you in the other world like as my body hath loved you in this, if thus the soul may love!" with that the tears fell from his eyes, nor, never sithence that he was knight, saith the story, had he wept for nought that had befallen him nor for heaviness of heart, but this time and one other. </s>
<s>  he taketh three blades of grass and so eateth thereof in token of the holy communion, then signeth him of the cross and blesseth him, riseth up, setteth himself on his knees and stretcheth forth his neck. </s>
<s>  the knight lifteth up the axe. </s>
<s>  lancelot heareth the blow coming, boweth his head and the axe misseth him. </s>
<s>  he saith to him, "sir knight, so did not my brother that you slew. </s>
<s>  rather, he held his head and neck quite still, and so behoveth you to do!" two damsels appeared at the palace-windows of passing great beauty, and they knew lancelot well. </s>
<s>  so, as the knight was aiming a second blow, one of the damsels crieth to him, "and you would have my love for evermore, throw down the axe and cry the knight quit! otherwise have you lost me for ever!" the knight forthwith flingeth down the axe and falleth at lancelot's feet and crieth mercy of him as of the most loyal knight in the world. </s>
<s>  "but you? have mercy on me, you! and slay me not!" saith lancelot, "for it is of you that i ought to pray mercy!" "sir," saith the knight, "of a surety will i not do this! rather will i help you to my power to save your life against all men, for all you have slain my brother. </s>
<s> " the damsels come down from the palace and are come to lancelot. </s>
<s>  xiv. </s>
<s>  "sir," say they to lancelot, "greatly ought we to love you, yea, better than all knights in the world beside. </s>
<s>  for we are the two damsels, sisters, that you saw so poor at the waste castle where you lay in our brother's house. </s>
<s>  you and messire gawain and another knight gave us the treasure and the hold of the robber- knights that you slew. </s>
<s>  for this city which is waste and the waste castle of my brother would never again be peopled of folk, nor should we never have had the land again, save a knight had come hither as loyal as are you. </s>
<s>  full a score knights have arrived here by chance in the same manner as you came, and not one of them but hath slain a brother or a kinsman and cut off his head as you did to the knight, and each one promised to return at the day appointed. </s>
<s>  but all failed of their covenant, for not one of them durst come to the day. </s>
<s>  and so you had failed us in like manner as the others, we should have lost this city without recovery and the castles that are its appanages. </s>

<s>  the vavasour turned him back, and they took charge of the child and nurtured him until that he were grown, and then took him to rome to the holy father, and showed him the sealed letters. </s>

<s>  wherefore the damsel biddeth you go by that way, by everything that you have ever loved, and that you fail her not, for she would fain speak with you at the issue of the cavern in an orchard that is nigh a right broad river not far from this castle, and will make your destrier be brought after you underground. </s>
<s> " "by my head," saith lancelot, "and she had not conjured me in such sort, and were it not for love of herself, i would have rather set myself in hazard with the knights than with the wild beasts, for far father would i have delivered myself from them, and so i might, than go forth in such-wise. </s>
<s> " "she sendeth you word," saith the messenger, "that so you do not thus, no further trouble will she take concerning you. </s>

<s>  and here behold a brachet that she sendeth you by me that you will carry with you into the cavern. </s>
<s>  so soon as you shalt see the serpent griffons that have couched them therein, you shall show them this and cast her down before them. </s>
<s>  the griffons love her as much as one beast may love another, and shall have such joy and such desire to play with the brachet that they will leave you alone, and have such good will toward you that they will not look at you after to do you any hurt. </s>
<s>  but no man is there in the world, no matter how well soever he were armed, nor how puissant soever he were in himself, might never pass them otherwise, but he should be devoured of them. </s>
<s>  but no safeguard may you have as against the lion but of god only and your own hardiment. </s>
<s> " "tell my damsel," saith lancelot, "that all her commandment will i do, but this cowardize resembleth none other, that i shall go fight with beasts and leave to do battle with knights. </s>
<s> " this was then repeated to the damsel, that marvelled her much thereat, and said that he was the hardiest knight in the world. </s>

<s>  lancelot armed him toward daybreak, and had his sword girt, his shield at his neck, and his spear in his hand. </s>
<s>  so he entered into the cavern, all shamefast, and the brachet followeth after, that he deigned not to carry, and so cometh he to the place where the griffons were. </s>
<s>  so soon as they heard him coming they dress them on their feet, and then writhe along as serpents, then cast forth such fire, and so bright a flame amidst the rock, as that all the cavern is lighted up thereof, and they see by the brightness of light of their jaws the brachet coming. </s>
<s>  so soon as they have espied her, they carry her in their claws and make her the greatest cheer in the world. </s>

<s>  "sir," saith she to lancelot, "are you wounded in any place?" "damsel, nowhere, thank god!" another damsel leadeth a horse into the orchard. </s>

<s> " "gramercy, damsel," saith lancelot, "your love and your good will fain would i have. </s>
<s>  but neither you nor none other damsel ought not to have affiance in me, and i might so soon set carelessly aside the love to whom my heart owed its obedience, for the worthiness and the courtesy that were lodged in her. </s>

<s>  "ha, god!" saith the damsel, "how am i betrayed, sith that i am parted from the best knight in the world! lancelot, you have done that which never yet no knight might do! now am i grieved that you should escape on such wise, and that your life hath been saved in this manner by me. </s>

<s>  he mounteth on his horse and issueth forth of the orchard by a postern gate, and entereth into the forest, and commendeth him to god. </s>
<s>  the lord of the castle of the griffons marvelleth much that lancelot delayeth so long. </s>

<s>  but the brachet had returned after the damsel, whereof the griffons were wroth, and they forthwith seized on the two knights that entered into their cavern and slew them and devoured. </s>
<s>  x. </s>
<s>  when the lord of the castle knew it, he went into the chamber where his daughter was, and found her weeping, and thinketh that it is for the two knights that are dead. </s>
<s>  news is brought him that the lion is dead at the issue of the cavern, and thereby well knoweth he that lancelot is gone. </s>

<s>  the damsel was right fain they should go after him, if only they might bring him back to the castle, for so mortally was she taken of his love that she thought of none other thing. </s>
<s>  but lancelot had her not in remembrance, but only another, and rode on sadly right amidst the forest, and looked from time to time at the rent the lion had made in his habergeon. </s>
<s>  he rideth until he is come toward evening to a great valley where was forest on the one side and the other, and the valley stretched onward half a score great leagues welsh. </s>
<s>  he looketh to the right, and on the top of the mountain beside the valley he seeth a chapel newly builded that was right fair and rich, and it was covered of lead, and had at the back two quoins that seemed to be of gold. </s>
<s>  by the side of this chapel were three houses dight right richly, each standing by itself facing the chapel. </s>
<s>  there was a right fair grave-yard round about the chapel, that was enclosed at the compass of the forest, and a spring came down, full clear, from the heights of the forest before the chapel and ran into the valley with a great rushing. </s>

<s>  there were three hermits therewithin that had sung their vespers, and came over against lancelot. </s>
<s>  they bowed their heads to him and he saluted them, and then asked of them what place was this? and they told him that the place there was avalon. </s>
<s>  they make stable his horse. </s>
<s>  he left his arms without the chapel and entereth therein, and saith that never hath he seen none so fair nor so rich. </s>
<s>  there were within three other places, right fair and seemly dight of rich cloths of silk and rich corners and fringes of gold. </s>
<s>  he seeth the images and the crucifixes all newly fashioned, and the chapel illumined of rich colours. </s>
<s>  and moreover in the midst thereof were two coffins, one against the other, and at the four corners four tall wax tapers burning, that were right rich, in four right rich candlesticks. </s>
<s>  the coffins were covered with two pails, and there were clerks that chanted psalms in turn on the one side and the other. </s>
<s>  "sir," saith lancelot to one of the hermits, "for whom were these coffins made?" "for king arthur and queen guenievre. </s>
<s> " "king arthur is not yet dead," saith lancelot. </s>
<s>  "no, in truth, please god! but the body of the queen lieth in the coffin before us and in the other is the head of her son, until such time as the king shall be ended, unto whom god grant long life! but the queen bade at her death that his body should be set beside her own when he shall end. </s>
<s>  hereof have we the letters and her seal in this chapel, and this place made she be builded new on this wise or ever she died. </s>

<s>  when lancelot heareth that it is the queen that lieth in the coffin, he is so straitened in his heart and in his speech that never a word may he say. </s>
<s>  but no semblant of grief durst he make other than such as might not be perceived, and right great comfort to him was it that there was an image of our lady at the head of the coffin. </s>
<s>  he knelt down the nighest he might to the coffin, as it had been to worship the image, and set his race and his mouth to the stone of the coffin, and sorroweth for her right sweetly. </s>
<s>  "ha, lady," saith he, "but that i dread the blame of the people, never again would i seek to depart from this place, but here would i save my soul and pray for yours. </s>
<s>  so would it be much recomforting to me that i should be so nigh, and should see the sepulchre wherein your body lieth that had so great sweetness and bounty. </s>

<s> " the night cometh on. </s>
<s>  a clerk cometh to the hermits and saith, "never yet did no knight cry mercy of god so sweetly, nor of his sweet mother, as did this knight that is in the chapel. </s>
<s> " and the hermits make answer that knights for the most part do well believe in god. </s>
<s>  they come to the chapel for him and bid him come thence, for that meat is ready and he should come to eat, and after that go to sleep and rest, for it is full time so to do. </s>
<s>  he telleth them that as for his eating this day it is stark nought, for a desire and a will hath taken him to keep vigil in the chapel before one of the images of our lady. </s>
<s>  no wish had he once to depart thence before the day, and he would fain that the night should last far longer than it did. </s>
<s>  the good men durst not force him against his will. </s>

<s>  such buffets deal they upon their helms that they beat them in and make the fire leap out by the force of the smiting of iron by steel. </s>

<s> " "by my head," saith the knight, "sith that you slew him, you are my mortal enemy!" so he draweth off in the midst of the launde and perceval likewise, and then they come together as fast as their horses may carry them, and either giveth other great buffets in the midst of their breast with their spears the most they may. </s>

<s>  he hath ridden so far one day and another, that he came into a land where he met knights stout and strong there where god was neither believed in nor loved, but where rather they adored false images and false lord-gods and devils that made themselves manifest. </s>

<s>  "ha, sir!" saith he to perceval, "return you back! no need is there for you to go further, for the folk of this island are not well-believers in god. </s>

<s>  thereof is she passing sorrowful, and hateth all them that believe in the new law, insomuch as that she would not look upon any that believed, and prayed to her gods that never might she see none until such time as the new law should be overthrown. </s>

<s>  "ha, damsel," saith he, "weep not, but repent you of this false belief, for they that are unwilling to believe in god shall die like mad folks and devils!" perceval made the squires that were there within bear the bodies out of the hall, and made them be cast into a running water, and straightway slew all the other, for that they were not minded to believe. </s>

<s>  she is in much dread of losing her l for her brother madeglant of oriande is dead, so that she may no longer look to none for succour, and she hath been told how the knight that conquered the raving castle is the best knight of the world, and that none may endure against him. </s>

<s>  perceval made bring the coffin of the other knight that was at the entrance of his castle within the chapel likewise, and place it beside the coffin of his uncle, nor never thereafter might it be removed. </s>

<s>  perceval heard one day a bell sound loud and high without the manor toward the sea. </s>

<s>  when the ship was anchored under the hall they went to pray in the most holy chapel. </s>
<s>  they brought the richest vessels of gold and silver that any might ever see, like as it were coffins, and set therein one of the three bodies of knights that had been brought into the chapel, and the body of king fisherman, and of the mother of perceval. </s>

<s>  perceval took leave of joseus and commended him to the saviour of the world, and took leave of the household, from whom he departed in like manner. </s>

<s>  the ship wherein perceval was drew far away, and a voice that issued from the manor as she departed commended them to god and to his sweet mother. </s>
<s>  josephus recordeth us that perceval departed in such wise, nor never thereafter did no earthly man know what became of him, nor doth the history speak of him more. </s>
<s>  but the history telleth us that joseus abode in the castle that had been king fisherman's, and shut himself up therein so that none might enter, and lived upon that the lord god might send him. </s>

<s>  after his end, the dwelling began to fall. </s>

<s>  when it was fallen into decay, many folk of the lands and islands that were nighest thereunto marvel them what may be in this manor. </s>

<s>  so either pledged him to other that they would go thither by way of gay adventure. </s>
<s>  but therein remained they of a long space after, and when again they came forth they led the life of hermits, and clad them in hair shirts, and went by the forest and so ate nought save roots only, and led a right hard life. </s>
<s>  yet ever they made as though they were glad, and if that any should ask whereof they rejoiced in such wise, "go," said they to them that asked, "thither where we have been, and you shall know the wherefore. </s>

<s>  the latin from whence this history was drawn into romance was taken in the isle of avalon, in a holy house of religion that standeth at the head of the moors adventurous, there where king arthur and queen guenievre lie, according to the witness of the good men religious that are therein, that have the whole history thereof, true from the beginning even to the end. </s>

<s>  this story is right long and right adventurous and weighty, but the book will now forthwith be silent thereof until another time. </s>

<s>  and the book that was made tofore this is so ancient that only with great pains may one make out the letter. </s>

<s>  and i say no, and i am going to prove it to you. </s>

<s>  well, then, compare the wretched, the despised, with the women of the highest society: the same dresses, the same fashions, the same perfumeries, the same passion for jewelry, for brilliant and very expensive articles, the same amusements, dances, music, and songs. </s>

<s>  our too abundant nourishment, together with complete physical idleness, is nothing but systematic excitement of the imagination. </s>
<s>  the men of our society are fed and kept like reproductive stallions. </s>
<s>  it is sufficient to close the valve,--that is, for a young man to live a quiet life for some time,--to produce as an immediate result a restlessness, which, becoming exaggerated by reflection through the prism of our unnatural life, provokes the illusion of love. </s>

<s>  you know what a peasant's food is,--bread, kvass, onions. </s>
<s>  with this frugal nourishment he lives, he is alert, he makes light work in the fields. </s>

<s>  kvass, a sort of cider. </s>
<s>  "and we, who eat two pounds of meat and game, we who absorb all sorts of heating drinks and food, how do we expend it? in sensual excesses. </s>
<s>  if the valve is open, all goes well. </s>
<s>  but close it, as i had closed it temporarily before my marriage, and immediately there will result an excitement which, deformed by novels, verses, music, by our idle and luxurious life, will give a love of the finest water. </s>
<s>  i, too, fell in love, as everybody does, and there were transports, emotions, poesy. </s>
<s>  but really all this passion was prepared by mamma and the dressmakers. </s>
<s>  if there had been no trips in boats, no well-fitted garments, etc. </s>
<s> , if my wife had worn some shapeless blouse, and i had seen her thus at her home, i should not have been seduced. </s>
<s>   chapter viii. </s>
<s>  "and note, also, this falsehood, of which all are guilty. </s>
<s>  the way in which marriages are made. </s>
<s>  what could there be more natural? the young girl is marriageable, she should marry. </s>
<s>  what simpler, provided the young person is not a monster, and men can be found with a desire to marry? well, no, here begins a new hypocrisy. </s>
<s>  "formerly, when the maiden arrived at a favorable age, her marriage was arranged by her parents. </s>
<s>  that was done, that is done still, throughout humanity, among the chinese, the hindoos, the mussulmans, and among our common people also. </s>
<s>  things are so managed in at least ninety-nine per cent. </s>
<s>  of the families of the entire human race. </s>
<s>  "only we riotous livers have imagined that this way was bad, and have invented another. </s>
<s>  and this other,--what is it? it is this. </s>
<s>  the young girls are seated, and the gentlemen walk up and down before them, as in a bazaar, and make their choice. </s>
<s>  the maidens wait and think, but do not dare to say: 'take me, young man, me and not her. </s>
<s>  look at these shoulders and the rest. </s>
<s> ' we males walk up and down, and estimate the merchandise, and then we discourse upon the rights of woman, upon the liberty that she acquires, i know not how, in the theatrical halls. </s>
<s> " "but what is to be done?" said i to him. </s>
<s>  "shall the woman make the advances?" "i do not know. </s>
<s>   if it is a question of equality, let the equality be complete. </s>
<s>  though it has been found that to contract marriages through the agency of match-makers is humiliating, it is nevertheless a thousand times preferable to our system. </s>
<s>  there the rights and the chances are equal. </s>
<s>  here the woman is a slave, exhibited in the market. </s>
<s>  but as she cannot bend to her condition, or make advances herself, there begins that other and more abominable lie which is sometimes called going into society, sometimes amusing one's self, and which is really nothing but the hunt for a husband. </s>
<s>  "but say to a mother or to her daughter that they are engaged only in a hunt for a husband. </s>
<s>  god! what an offence! yet they can do nothing else, and have nothing else to do. </s>
<s>  and the terrible feature of it all is to see sometimes very young, poor, and innocent maidens haunted solely by such ideas. </s>
<s>  if only, i repeat, it were done frankly. </s>
<s>  but it is always accompanied with lies and babble of this sort:-- "'ah, the descent of species! how interesting it is!' "'oh, lily is much interested in painting. </s>

<s>  ah, how adorable!' "'my lise is passionately fond of music. </s>
<s> ' "'and you, why do you not share these convictions?' "and through all this verbiage, all have but one single idea: 'take me, take my lise. </s>
<s>  no, me! only try!"'  chapter ix. </s>
<s>  "do you know," suddenly continued posdnicheff, "that this power of women from which the world suffers arises solely from what i have just spoken of?" "what do you mean by the power of women?" i said. </s>
<s>  "everybody, on the contrary, complains that women have not sufficient rights, that they are in subjection. </s>
<s> " "that's it. </s>
<s>  that's it exactly," said he, vivaciously. </s>
<s>  "that is just what i mean, and that is the explanation of this extraordinary phenomenon, that on the one hand woman is reduced to the lowest degree of humiliation and on the other hand she reigns over everything. </s>
<s>  see the jews: with their power of money, they avenge their subjection, just as the women do. </s>
<s>  'ah! you wish us to be only merchants? all right. </s>
<s>  remaining merchants, we will get possession of you,' say the jews. </s>
<s>  'ah! you wish us to be only objects of sensuality? all right. </s>
<s>  by the aid of sensuality we will bend you beneath our yoke,' say the women. </s>
<s>  "the absence of the rights of woman does not consist in the fact that she has not the right to vote, or the right to sit on the bench, but in the fact that in her affectional relations she is not the equal of man, she has not the right to abstain, to choose instead of being chosen. </s>
<s>  you say that that would be abnormal. </s>
<s>  very well! but then do not let man enjoy these rights, while his companion is deprived of them, and finds herself obliged to make use of the coquetry by which she governs, so that the result is that man chooses 'formally,' whereas really it is woman who chooses. </s>
<s>  as soon as she is in possession of her means, she abuses them, and acquires a terrible supremacy. </s>
<s> " "but where do you see this exceptional power?" "where? why, everywhere, in everything. </s>
<s>  go see the stores in the large cities. </s>
<s>  there are millions there, millions. </s>
<s>  it is impossible to estimate the enormous quantity of labor that is expended there. </s>
<s>  in nine-tenths of these stores is there anything whatever for the use of men? all the luxury of life is demanded and sustained by woman. </s>
<s>  count the factories. </s>
<s>  the greater part of them are engaged in making feminine ornaments. </s>
<s>  millions of men, generations of slaves, die toiling like convicts simply to satisfy the whims of our companions. </s>
<s>  "women, like queens, keep nine-tenths of the human race as prisoners of war, or as prisoners at hard labor. </s>
<s>  and all this because they have been humiliated, because they have been deprived of rights equal to those which men enjoy. </s>
<s>  they take revenge for our sensuality. </s>
<s>  they catch us in their nets. </s>
<s>  "yes, the whole thing is there. </s>
<s>  women have made of themselves such a weapon to act upon the senses that a young man, and even an old man, cannot remain tranquil in their presence. </s>
<s>  watch a popular festival, or our receptions or ball-rooms. </s>
<s>  woman well knows her influence there. </s>
<s>  you will see it in her triumphant smiles. </s>
<s>  "as soon as a young man advances toward a woman, directly he falls under the influence of this opium, and loses his head. </s>
<s>  long ago i felt ill at ease when i saw a woman too well adorned,--whether a woman of the people with her red neckerchief and her looped skirt, or a woman of our own society in her ball-room dress. </s>
<s>  but now it simply terrifies me. </s>
<s>  i see in it a danger to men, something contrary to the laws. </s>
<s>  and i feel a desire to call a policeman, to appeal for defence from some quarter, to demand that this dangerous object be removed. </s>
<s>  "and this is not a joke, by any means. </s>
<s>  i am convinced, i am sure, that the time will come--and perhaps it is not far distant--when the world will understand this, and will be astonished that a society could exist in which actions as harmful as those which appeal to sensuality by adorning the body as our companions do were allowed. </s>

<s>  "that, then, was the way in which i was captured. </s>
<s>  i was in love, as it is called. </s>
<s>  not only did she appear to me a perfect being, but i considered myself a white blackbird. </s>
<s>  it is a commonplace fact that there is no one so low in the world that he cannot find some one viler than himself, and consequently puff with pride and self-contentment. </s>
<s>  i was in that situation. </s>
<s>  i did not marry for money. </s>
<s>  interest was foreign to the affair, unlike the marriages of most of my acquaintances, who married either for money or for relations. </s>
<s>  first, i was rich, she was poor. </s>
<s>  second, i was especially proud of the fact that, while others married with an intention of continuing their polygamic life as bachelors, it was my firm intention to live monogamically after my engagement and the wedding, and my pride swelled immeasurably. </s>
<s>  "yes, i was a wretch, convinced that i was an angel. </s>
<s>  the period of my engagement did not last long. </s>
<s>  i cannot remember those days without shame. </s>
<s>  what an abomination! "it is generally agreed that love is a moral sentiment, a community of thought rather than of sense. </s>
<s>  if that is the case, this community of thought ought to find expression in words and conversation. </s>
<s>  nothing of the sort. </s>
<s>  it was extremely difficult for us to talk with each other. </s>
<s>  what a toil of sisyphus was our conversation! scarcely had we thought of something to say, and said it, when we had to r‚sum‚ our silence and try to discover new subjects. </s>
<s>  literally, we did not know what to say to each other. </s>
<s>  all that we could think of concerning the life that was before us and our home was said. </s>
<s>  "and then what? if we had been animals, we should have known that we had not to talk. </s>
<s>  but here, on the contrary, it was necessary to talk, and there were no resources! for that which occupied our minds was not a thing to be expressed in words. </s>
<s>  "and then that silly custom of eating bon-bons, that brutal gluttony for sweetmeats, those abominable preparations for the wedding, those discussions with mamma upon the apartments, upon the sleeping-rooms, upon the bedding, upon the morning-gowns, upon the wrappers, the linen, the costumes! understand that if people married according to the old fashion, as this old man said just now, then these eiderdown coverlets and this bedding would all be sacred details. </s>
<s>  but with us, out of ten married people there is scarcely to be found one who, i do not say believes in sacraments , he said, "why did you almost crush the life out of the old grandmother? be more gentle. </s>
<s>  i have plenty more, and i will give them to you. </s>
<s> " whereupon he began throwing about more of the coins. </s>
<s>  the people gathered around him, and ivan continued throwing until he emptied his bag. </s>
<s>  they clamored for more, but ivan replied: "the gold is all gone. </s>
<s>  another time i will give you more. </s>
<s>  now we will r‚sum‚ our singing and dancing. </s>
<s> " the little children sang, but ivan said to them, "your songs are no good. </s>
<s> " the children said, "then show us how to sing better. </s>
<s> " to this ivan replied, "i will show you people who can sing better than you. </s>
<s> " with that remark ivan went to the barn  securing a bundle of straw, did as the little devil had directed him. </s>
<s>  and presently a regiment of soldiers appeared in the village street, and he ordered them to sing and dance. </s>
<s>  the people were astonished and could not understand how ivan had produced the strangers. </s>
<s>  the soldiers sang for some time, to the great delight of the villagers. </s>
<s>  and when ivan commanded them to stop they instantly ceased. </s>
<s>  ivan then ordered them off to the barn, telling the astonished and mystified moujiks that they must not follow him. </s>
<s>  reaching the barn, he turned the soldiers again into straw and went home to sleep off the effects of his debauch. </s>

<s>  the next morning ivan's exploits were the talk of the village, and news of the wonderful things he had done reached the ears of his brother simeon, who immediately went to ivan to learn all about it. </s>
<s>  "explain to me," he said. </s>
<s>  "from whence did you bring the soldiers, and where did you take them?" "and what do you wish to know for?" asked ivan. </s>
<s>  "why, with soldiers we can do almost anything we wish--whole kingdoms can be conquered," replied simeon. </s>
<s>  this information greatly surprised ivan, who said: "well, why did you not tell me about this before? i can make as many as you want. </s>
<s> " ivan then took his brother to the barn, but he said: "while i am willing to create the soldiers, you must take them away from here. </s>
<s>  for if it should become necessary to feed them, all the food in the village would last them only one day. </s>
<s> " simeon promised to do as ivan wished, whereupon ivan proceeded to convert the straw into soldiers. </s>
<s>  out of one bundle of straw he made an entire regiment. </s>
<s>  in fact, so many soldiers appeared as if by magic that there was not a vacant spot in the field. </s>
<s>  turning to simeon ivan said, "well, is there a sufficient number?" beaming with joy, simeon replied: "enough! enough! thank you, ivan!" "glad you are satisfied," said ivan, "and if you wish more i will make them for you. </s>
<s>  i have plenty of straw now. </s>
<s> " simeon divided his soldiers into battalions and regiments, and after having drilled them he went forth to fight and to conquer. </s>
<s>  simeon had just gotten safely out of the village with his soldiers when tarras, the other brother, appeared before ivan--he also having heard of the previous day's performance and wanting to learn the secret of his power. </s>
<s>  he sought ivan, saying: "tell me the secret of your supply of gold, for if i had plenty of money i could with its assistance gather in all the wealth in the world. </s>
<s> " ivan was greatly surprised on hearing this statement, and said: "you might have told me this before, for i can obtain for you as much money as you wish. </s>
<s> " tarras was delighted, and he said, "you might get me about three bushels. </s>
<s> " "well," said ivan, "we will go to the woods, or, better still, we will harness the horse, as we could not possibly carry so much money ourselves. </s>
<s> " the brothers went to the woods and ivan proceeded to gather the oak leaves, which he rubbed between his hands, the dust falling to the ground and turning into gold pieces as quickly as it fell. </s>
<s>  when quite a pile had accumulated ivan turned to tarras and asked if he had rubbed enough leaves into money, whereupon tarras replied: "thank you, ivan. </s>

<s>  head- straps, passing across the forehead, helped support these packs. </s>
<s>   each man carried a rifle. </s>
<s>  they walked in a stooped posture, the shoulders well forward, the head still farther forward, the eyes bent upon the ground. </s>
<s>  "i wish we had just about two of them cartridges that's layin' in that cache of ourn," said the second man. </s>
<s>  his voice was utterly and drearily expressionless. </s>
<s>  he spoke without enthusiasm. </s>
<s>  and the first man, limping into the milky stream that foamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply. </s>
<s>  the other man followed at his heels. </s>
<s>  they did not remove their foot-gear, though the water was icy cold - so cold that their ankles ached and their feet went numb. </s>
<s>  in places the water dashed against their knees, and both men staggered for footing. </s>
<s>  the man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell, but recovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time uttering a sharp exclamation of pain. </s>
<s>  he seemed faint and dizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled, as though seeking support against the air. </s>
<s>  when he had steadied himself he stepped forward, but reeled again and nearly fell. </s>
<s>  then he stood still and looked at the other man, who had never turned his head. </s>
<s>  the man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating with himself. </s>
<s>  then he called out: "i say, bill, i have sprained my ankle. </s>
<s> " bill staggered on through the milky water. </s>
<s>  he did not look around. </s>
<s>   the man watched him go, and though his face was expressionless as ever, his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer. </s>
<s>  the other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on without looking back. </s>
<s>  the man in the stream watched him. </s>
<s>  his lips trembled a little, so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly agitated. </s>
<s>  his tongue even strayed out to moisten them. </s>
<s>  "bill!" he cried out. </s>
<s>  it was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress, but bill's head did not turn. </s>
<s>  the man watched him go, limping grotesquely and lurching forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft sky-line of the low-lying hill. </s>
<s>  he watched him go till he passed over the crest and disappeared. </s>
<s>  then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now that bill was gone. </s>
<s>  near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly, almost obscured by formless mists and vapors, which gave an impression of mass and density without outline or tangibility. </s>
<s>  the man pulled out his watch, the while resting his weight on one leg. </s>
<s>  it was four o'clock, and as the season was near the last of july or first of august, - he did not know the precise date within a week or two, - he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest. </s>
<s>  he looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the great bear lake. </s>
<s>  also, he knew that in that direction the arctic circle cut its forbidding way across the canadian barrens. </s>
<s>  this stream in which he stood was a feeder to the coppermine river, which in turn flowed north and emptied into coronation gulf and the arctic ocean. </s>
<s>  he had never been there, but he had seen it, once, on a hudson bay company chart. </s>
<s>  again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him. </s>
<s>  it was not a heartening spectacle. </s>
<s>  everywhere was soft sky-line. </s>
<s>  the hills were all low-lying. </s>
<s>  there were no trees, no shrubs, no grasses - naught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning into his eyes. </s>
<s>  "bill!" he whispered, once and twice. </s>
<s>  "bill!" he cowered in the midst of the milky water, as though the vastness were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force, brutally crushing him with its complacent awfulness. </s>
<s>  he began to shake as with an ague-fit, till the gun fell from his hand with a splash. </s>
<s>   this served to rouse him. </s>
<s>  he fought with his fear and pulled himself together, groping in the water and recovering the weapon. </s>
<s>   he hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder, so as to take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle. </s>
<s>  then he proceeded, slowly and carefully, wincing with pain, to the bank. </s>
<s>  he did not stop. </s>
<s>  with a desperation that was madness, unmindful of the pain, he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over which his comrade had disappeared - more grotesque and comical by far than that limping, jerking comrade. </s>
<s>  but at the crest he saw a shallow valley, empty of life. </s>
<s>  he fought with his fear again, overcame it, hitched the pack still farther over on his left shoulder, and lurched on down the slope. </s>
<s>  the bottom of the valley was soggy with water, which the thick moss held, spongelike, close to the surface. </s>
<s>  this water squirted out from under his feet at every step, and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip. </s>
<s>  he picked his way from muskeg to muskeg, and followed the other man's footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss. </s>
<s>  though alone, he was not lost. </s>
<s>  farther on he knew he would come to where dead spruce and fir, very small and weazened, bordered the shore of a little lake, the titchin-nichilie, in the tongue of the country, the "land of little sticks. </s>
<s> " and into that lake flowed a small stream, the water of which was not milky. </s>
<s>  there was rush- grass on that stream - this he remembered well - but no timber, and he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a divide. </s>
<s>  he would cross this divide to the first trickle of another stream, flowing to the west, which he would follow until it emptied into the river dease, and here he would find a cache under an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks. </s>
<s>  and in this cache would be ammunition for his empty gun, fish-hooks and lines, a small net - all the utilities for the killing and snaring of food. </s>
<s>  also, he would find flour, - not much, - a piece of bacon, and some beans. </s>
<s>  bill would be waiting for him there, and they would paddle away south down the dease to the great bear lake. </s>
<s>  and south across the lake they would go, ever south, till they gained the mackenzie. </s>
<s>   and south, still south, they would go, while the winter raced vainly after them, and the ice formed in the eddies, and the days grew chill and crisp, south to some warm hudson bay company post, where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end. </s>
<s>  these were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward. </s>
<s>  but hard as he strove with his body, he strove equally hard with his mind, trying to think that bill had not deserted him, that bill would surely wait for him at the cache. </s>
<s>  he was compelled to think this thought, or else there would not be any use to strive, and he would have lain down and died. </s>
<s>  and as the dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered every inch - and many times - of his and bill's flight south before the downcoming winter. </s>
<s>  and he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the hudson bay company post over and over again. </s>
<s>  he had not eaten for two days. </s>
<s>  for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat. </s>
<s>  often he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries, put them into his mouth, and chewed and swallowed them. </s>
<s>  a muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water. </s>
<s>  in the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter. </s>
<s>  the man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience. </s>
<s>  at nine o'clock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge, and from sheer weariness and weakness staggered and fell. </s>
<s>  he lay for some time, without movement, on his side. </s>
<s>  then he slipped out of the pack- straps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture. </s>
<s>  it was not yet dark, and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of dry moss. </s>
<s>  when he had gathered a heap he built a fire, - a smouldering, smudgy fire, - and put a tin pot of water on to boil. </s>
<s>  he unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his matches. </s>
<s>  there were sixty-seven. </s>
<s>  he counted them three times to make sure. </s>
<s>  he divided them into several portions, wrapping them in oil paper, disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch, of another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat, of a third bunch under his shirt on the chest. </s>
<s>  this accomplished, a panic came upon him, and he unwrapped them all and counted them again. </s>
<s>   there were still sixty-seven. </s>
<s>  he dried his wet foot-gear by the fire. </s>
<s>  the moccasins were in soggy shreds. </s>
<s>  the blanket socks were worn through in places, and his feet were raw and bleeding. </s>
<s>  his ankle was throbbing, and he gave it an examination. </s>
<s>  it had swollen to the size of his knee. </s>
<s>   he tore a long strip from one of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly. </s>
<s>  he tore other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both moccasins and socks. </s>
<s>  then he drank the pot of water, steaming hot, wound his watch, and crawled between his blankets. </s>
<s>  he slept like a dead man. </s>
<s>  the brief darkness around midnight came and went. </s>
<s>  the sun arose in the northeast - at least the day dawned in that quarter, for the sun was hidden by gray clouds. </s>
<s>  at six o'clock he awoke, quietly lying on his back. </s>
<s>  he gazed straight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry. </s>
<s>  as he rolled over on his elbow he was startled by a loud snort, and saw a bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity. </s>
<s>  the animal was not mere than fifty feet away, and instantly into the man's mind leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and frying over a fire. </s>
<s>  mechanically he reached for the empty gun, drew a bead, and pulled the trigger. </s>
<s>  the bull snorted and leaped away, his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the ledges. </s>
<s>  the man cursed and flung the empty gun from him. </s>
<s>  he groaned aloud as he started to drag himself to his feet. </s>
<s>  it was a slow and arduous task. </s>
<s>  his joints were like rusty hinges. </s>
<s>  they worked harshly in their sockets, with much friction, and each bending or unbending was accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will. </s>
<s>  when he finally gained his feet, another minute or so was consumed in straightening up, so that he could stand erect as a man should stand. </s>
<s>  he crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect. </s>
<s>  there were no trees, no bushes, nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely diversified by gray rocks, gray lakelets, and gray streamlets. </s>
<s>  the sky was gray. </s>
<s>  there was no sun nor hint of sun. </s>
<s>  he had no idea of north, and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the night before. </s>
<s>  but he was not lost. </s>
<s>  he knew that. </s>
<s>  soon he would come to the land of the little sticks. </s>
<s>  he felt that it lay off to the left somewhere, not far - possibly just over the next low hill. </s>
<s>  he went back to put his pack into shape for travelling. </s>
<s>  he assured himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches, though he did not stop to count them. </s>
<s>  but he did linger, debating, over a squat moose-hide sack. </s>
<s>  it was not large. </s>
<s>  he could hide it under his two hands. </s>
<s>  he knew that it weighed fifteen pounds, - as much as all the rest of the pack, - and it worried him. </s>
<s>  he finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack. </s>
<s>  he paused to gaze at the squat moose-hide sack. </s>
<s>  he picked it up hastily with a defiant glance about him, as though the desolation were trying to rob him of it. </s>
<s>  and when he rose to his feet to stagger on into the day, it was included in the pack on his back. </s>
<s>  he bore away to the left, stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries. </s>
<s>  his ankle had stiffened, his limp was more pronounced, but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his stomach. </s>
<s>  the hunger pangs were sharp. </s>
<s>  they gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind steady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little sticks. </s>
<s>  the muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing, while they made his tongue and the roof of his mouth sore with their irritating bite. </s>
<s>  he came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings from the ledges and muskegs. </s>
<s>  ker - ker - ker was the cry they made. </s>
<s>  he threw stones at them, but could not hit them. </s>
<s>  he placed his pack on the ground and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow. </s>
<s>   the sharp rocks cut through his pants' legs till his knees left a trail of blood. </s>
<s>  but the hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger. </s>
<s>   he squirmed over the wet moss, saturating his clothes and chilling his body. </s>
<s>  but he was not aware of it, so great was his fever for food. </s>
<s>  and always the ptarmigan rose, whirring, before him, till their ker - ker - ker became a mock to him, and he cursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry. </s>
<s>  once he crawled upon one that must have been asleep. </s>
<s>  he did not see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook. </s>
<s>  he made a clutch as startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan, and there remained in his hand three tail-feathers. </s>
<s>  as he watched its flight he hated it, as though it had done him some terrible wrong. </s>
<s>  then he returned and shouldered his pack. </s>
<s>  as the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was more plentiful. </s>
<s>  a band of caribou passed by, twenty and odd animals, tantalizingly within rifle range. </s>
<s>  he felt a wild desire to run after them, a certitude that he could run them down. </s>
<s>  a black fox came toward him, carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth. </s>
<s>  the man shouted. </s>
<s>  it was a fearful cry, but the fox, leaping away in fright, did not drop the ptarmigan. </s>
<s>  late in the afternoon he followed a stream, milky with lime, which ran through sparse patches of rush-grass. </s>
<s>  grasping these rushes firmly near the root, he pulled up what resembled a young onion- sprout no larger than a shingle-nail. </s>
<s>  it was tender, and his teeth sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food. </s>
<s>  but its fibers were tough. </s>
<s>  it was composed of stringy filaments saturated with water, like the berries, and devoid of nourishment. </s>
<s>   he threw off his pack and went into the rush-grass on hands and knees, crunching and munching, like some bovine creature. </s>
<s>  he was very weary and often wished to rest - to lie down and sleep. </s>
<s>  but he was continually driven on - not so much by his desire to gain the land of little sticks as by his hunger. </s>
<s>  he searched little ponds for frogs and dug up the earth with his nails for worms, though he knew in spite that neither frogs nor worms existed so far north. </s>
<s>  he looked into every pool of water vainly, until, as the long twilight came on, he discovered a solitary fish, the size of a minnow, in such a pool. </s>
<s>  he plunged his arm in up to the shoulder, but it eluded him. </s>
<s>  he reached for it with both hands and stirred up the milky mud at the bottom. </s>
<s>  in his excitement he fell in, wetting himself to the waist. </s>
<s>  then the water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish, and he was compelled to wait until the sediment had settled. </s>
<s>  the pursuit was renewed, till the water was again muddied. </s>
<s>  but he could not wait. </s>
<s>  he unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool. </s>
<s>  he baled wildly at first, splashing himself and flinging the water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool. </s>
<s>  he worked more carefully, striving to be cool, though his heart was pounding against his chest and his hands were trembling. </s>
<s>  at the end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry. </s>
<s>  not a cupful of water remained. </s>
<s>  and there was no fish. </s>
<s>  he found a hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger pool - a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day. </s>
<s>  had he known of the crevice, he could have closed it with a rock at the beginning and the fish would have been his. </s>
<s>  thus he thought, and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth. </s>
<s>   at first he cried softly to himself, then he cried loudly to the pitiless desolation that ringed him around. </s>
<s>  and for a long time after he was shaken by great dry sobs. </s>
<s>  he built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot water, and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night before. </s>
<s>  the last thing he did was to see that his matches were dry and to wind his watch. </s>
<s>  the blankets were wet and clammy. </s>
<s>  his ankle pulsed with pain. </s>
<s>  but he knew only that he was hungry, and through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and banquets and of food served and spread in all imaginable ways. </s>
<s>  he awoke chilled and sick. </s>
<s>  there was no sun. </s>
<s>  the gray of earth and sky had become deeper, more profound. </s>
<s>  a raw wind was blowing, and the first flurries of snow were whitening the hilltops. </s>
<s>  the air about him thickened and grew white while he made a fire and boiled more water. </s>
<s>  it was wet snow, half rain, and the flakes were large and soggy. </s>
<s>  at first they melted as soon as they came in contact with the earth, but ever more fell, covering the ground, putting out the fire, spoiling his supply of moss-fuel. </s>
<s>  this was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble onward, he knew not where. </s>
<s>  he was not concerned with the land of little sticks, nor with bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the river dease. </s>
<s>  he was mastered by the verb "to eat. </s>
<s> " he was hunger- mad. </s>
<s>  he took no heed of the course he pursued, so long as that course led him through the swale bottoms. </s>
<s>  he felt his way through the wet snow to the watery muskeg berries, and went by feel as he pulled up the rush-grass by the roots. </s>
<s>  but it was tasteless stuff and did not satisfy. </s>
<s>  he found a weed that tasted sour and he ate all he could find of it, which was not much, for it was a creeping growth, easily hidden under the several inches of snow. </s>
<s>  he had no fire that night, nor hot water, and crawled under his blanket to sleep the broken hunger-sleep. </s>
<s>  the snow turned into a cold rain. </s>
<s>  he awakened many times to feel it falling on his upturned face. </s>
<s>  day came - a gray day and no sun. </s>
<s>  it had ceased raining. </s>
<s>  the keenness of his hunger had departed. </s>
<s>  sensibility, as far as concerned the yearning for food, had been exhausted. </s>
<s>  there was a dull, heavy ache in his stomach, but it did not bother him so much. </s>
<s>  he was more rational, and once more he was chiefly interested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the river dease. </s>
<s>  he ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and bound his bleeding feet. </s>
<s>  also, he recinched the injured ankle and prepared himself for a day of travel. </s>
<s>  when he came to his pack, he paused long over the squat moose-hide sack, but in the end it went with him. </s>
<s>  the snow had melted under the rain, and only the hilltops showed white. </s>
<s>  the sun came out, and he succeeded in locating the points of the compass, though he knew now that he was lost. </s>
<s>  perhaps, in his previous days' wanderings, he had edged away too far to the left. </s>
<s>  he now bore off to the right to counteract the possible deviation from his true course. </s>
<s>  though the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite, he realized that he was weak. </s>
<s>  he was compelled to pause for frequent rests, when he attacked the muskeg berries and rush-grass patches. </s>
<s>  his tongue felt dry and large, as though covered with a fine hairy growth, and it tasted bitter in his mouth. </s>
<s>  his heart gave him a great deal of trouble. </s>
<s>  when he had travelled a few minutes it would begin a remorseless thump, thump, thump, and then leap up and away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go faint and dizzy. </s>
<s>  in the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool. </s>
<s>  it was impossible to bale it, but he was calmer now and managed to catch them in his tin bucket. </s>
<s>  they were no longer than his little finger, but he was not particularly hungry. </s>
<s>  the dull ache in his stomach had been growing duller and fainter. </s>
<s>  it seemed almost that his stomach was dozing. </s>
<s>  he ate the fish raw, masticating with painstaking care, for the eating was an act of pure reason. </s>
<s>  while he had no desire to eat, he knew that he must eat to live. </s>
<s>  in the evening he caught three more minnows, eating two and saving the third for breakfast. </s>
<s>  the sun had dried stray shreds of moss, and he was able to warm himself with hot water. </s>
<s>  he had not covered more than ten miles that day. </s>
<s>  and the next day, travelling whenever his heart permitted him, he covered no more than five miles. </s>
<s>  but his stomach did not give him the slightest uneasiness. </s>
<s>  it had gone to sleep. </s>
<s>  he was in a strange country, too, and the caribou were growing more plentiful, also the wolves. </s>
<s>  often their yelps drifted across the desolation, and once he saw three of them slinking away before his path. </s>
<s>  another night. </s>
<s>  and in the morning, being more rational, he untied the leather string that fastened the squat moose-hide sack. </s>
<s>  from its open mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse gold-dust and nuggets. </s>
<s>  he roughly divided the gold in halves, caching one half on a prominent ledge, wrapped in a piece of blanket, and returning the other half to the sack. </s>
<s>  he also began to use strips of the one remaining blanket for his feet. </s>
<s>  he still clung to his gun, for there were cartridges in that cache by the river dease. </s>
<s>  this was a day of fog, and this day hunger awoke in him again. </s>
<s>  he was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times blinded him. </s>
<s>  it was no uncommon thing now for him to stumble and fall. </s>
<s>  and stumbling once, he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest. </s>
<s>   there were four newly hatched chicks, a day old - little specks of pulsating life no more than a mouthful. </s>
<s>  and he ate them ravenously, thrusting them alive into his mouth and crunching them like egg- shells between his teeth. </s>
<s>  the mother ptarmigan beat about him with great outcry. </s>
<s>  he used his gun as a club with which to knock her over, but she dodged out of reach. </s>
<s>  he threw stones at her and with one chance shot broke a wing. </s>
<s>  then she fluttered away, running, trailing the broken wing, with him in pursuit. </s>
<s>  the little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite. </s>
<s>  he hopped and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle, throwing stones and screaming hoarsely at times. </s>
<s>  at other times hopping and bobbing silently along, picking himself up grimly and patiently when he fell, or rubbing his eyes with his hand when the giddiness threatened to overpower him. </s>
<s>  the chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley, and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss. </s>
<s>  they were not his own - he could see that. </s>
<s>  they must be bill's. </s>
<s>  but he could not stop, for the mother ptarmigan was running on. </s>
<s>  he would catch her first, then he would return and investigate. </s>
<s>  he exhausted the mother ptarmigan. </s>
<s>  but he exhausted himself. </s>
<s>  she lay panting on her side. </s>
<s>  he lay panting on his side, a dozen feet away, unable to crawl to her. </s>
<s>  and as he recovered she recovered, fluttering out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her. </s>
<s>  the chase was resumed. </s>
<s>  night settled down and she escaped. </s>
<s>  he stumbled from weakness and pitched head foremost on his face, cutting his cheek, his pack upon his back. </s>
<s>  he did not move for a long while. </s>
<s>  then he rolled over on his side, wound his watch, and lay there until morning. </s>
<s>  another day of fog. </s>
<s>  half of his last blanket had gone into foot- wrappings. </s>
<s>  he failed to pick up bill's trail. </s>
<s>  it did not matter. </s>
<s>   his hunger was driving him too compellingly - only - only he wondered if bill, too, were lost. </s>
<s>  by midday the irk of his pack became too oppressive. </s>
<s>  again he divided the gold, this time merely spilling half of it on the ground. </s>
<s>  in the afternoon he threw the rest of it away, there remaining to him only the half-blanket, the tin bucket, and the rifle. </s>
<s>  an hallucination began to trouble him. </s>
<s>  he felt confident that one cartridge remained to him. </s>
<s>  it was in the chamber of the rifle and he had overlooked it. </s>
<s>  on the other h he knew all the time that the chamber was empty. </s>
<s>  but the hallucination persisted. </s>
<s>  he fought it off for hours, then threw his rifle open and was confronted with emptiness. </s>
<s>  the disappointment was as bitter as though he had really expected to find the cartridge. </s>
<s>  he plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again. </s>
<s>   again he fought it, and still it persisted, till for very relief he opened his rifle to unconvince himself. </s>
<s>  at times his mind wandered farther afield, and he plodded on, a mere automaton, strange conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his brain like worms. </s>
<s>  but these excursions out of the real were of brief duration, for ever the pangs of the hunger-bite called him back. </s>
<s>  he was jerked back abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight that caused him nearly to faint. </s>
<s>  he reeled and swayed, doddering like a drunken man to keep from falling. </s>
<s>  before him stood a horse. </s>
<s>  a horse! he could not believe his eyes. </s>
<s>  a thick mist was in them, intershot with sparkling points of light. </s>
<s>  he rubbed his eyes savagely to clear his vision, and beheld, not a horse, but a great brown bear. </s>
<s>   the animal was studying him with bellicose curiosity. </s>
<s>  the man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he realized. </s>
<s>  he lowered it and drew his hunting-knife from its beaded sheath at his hip. </s>
<s>  before him was meat and life. </s>
<s>  he ran his thumb along the edge of his knife. </s>
<s>  it was sharp. </s>
<s>  the point was sharp. </s>
<s>   he would fling himself upon the bear and kill it. </s>
<s>  but his heart began its warning thump, thump, thump. </s>
<s>  then followed the wild upward leap and tattoo of flutters, the pressing as of an iron band about his forehead, the creeping of the dizziness into his brain. </s>
<s>  his desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear. </s>
<s>  in his weakness, what if the animal attacked him? he drew himself up to his most imposing stature, gripping the knife and staring hard at the bear. </s>
<s>  the bear advanced clumsily a couple of steps, reared up, and gave vent to a tentative growl. </s>
<s>  if the man ran, he would run after him. </s>
<s>  but the man did not run. </s>
<s>  he was animated now with the courage of fear. </s>
<s>  he, too, growled, savagely, terribly, voicing the fear that is to life germane and that lies twisted about life's deepest roots. </s>
<s>  the bear edged away to one side, growling menacingly, himself appalled by this mysterious creature that appeared upright and unafraid. </s>
<s>  but the man did not move. </s>
<s>  he stood like a statue till the danger was past, when he yielded to a fit of trembling and sank down into the wet moss. </s>
<s>  he pulled himself together and went on, afraid now in a new way. </s>
<s>   it was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food, but that he should be destroyed violently before starvation had exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him that made toward surviving. </s>
<s>  there were the wolves. </s>
<s>  back and forth across the desolation drifted their howls, weaving the very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he found himself, arms in the air, pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a wind- blown tent. </s>
<s>  now and again the wolves, in packs of two and three, crossed his path. </s>
<s>  but they sheered clear of him. </s>
<s>  they were not in sufficient numbers, and besides they were hunting the caribou, which did not battle, while this strange creature that walked erect might scratch and bite. </s>
<s>  in the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves had made a kill. </s>
<s>  the debris had been a caribou calf an hour before, squawking and running and very much alive. </s>
<s>  he contemplated the bones, clean-picked and polished, pink with the cell-life in them which had not yet died. </s>
<s>  could it possibly be that he might be that ere the day was done! such was life, eh? a vain and fleeting thing. </s>
<s>  it was only life that pained. </s>
<s>  there was no hurt in death. </s>
<s>   to die was to sleep. </s>
<s>  it meant cessation, rest. </s>
<s>  then why was he not content to die? but he did not moralize long. </s>
<s>  he was squatting in the moss, a bone in his mouth, sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it faintly pink. </s>
<s>  the sweet meaty taste, thin and elusive almost as a memory, maddened him. </s>
<s>  he closed his jaws on the bones and crunched. </s>
<s>  sometimes it was the bone that broke, sometimes his teeth. </s>
<s>  then he crushed the bones between rocks, pounded them to a pulp, and swallowed them. </s>
<s>  he pounded his fingers, too, in his haste, and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending rock. </s>
<s>  came frightful days of snow and rain. </s>
<s>  he did not know when he made camp, when he broke camp. </s>
<s>  he travelled in the night as much as in the day. </s>
<s>  he rested wherever he fell, crawled on whenever the dying life in him flickered up and burned less dimly. </s>
<s>  he, as a man, no longer strove. </s>
<s>  it was the life in him, unwilling to die, that drove him on. </s>
<s>  he did not suffer. </s>
<s>  his nerves had become blunted, numb, while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious dreams. </s>
<s>  but ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou calf, the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried with him. </s>
<s>  he crossed no more hills or divides, but automatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley. </s>
<s>  he did not see this stream nor this valley. </s>
<s>  he saw nothing save visions. </s>
<s>  soul and body walked or crawled side by side, yet apart, so slender was the thread that bound them. </s>
<s>  he awoke in his right mind, lying on his back on a rocky ledge. </s>
<s>   the sun was shining bright and warm. </s>
<s>  afar off he heard the squawking of caribou calves. </s>
<s>  he was aware of vague memories of rain and wind and snow, but whether he had been beaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did not know. </s>
<s>  for some time he lay without movement, the genial sunshine pouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth. </s>
<s>  a fine day, he thought. </s>
<s>  perhaps he could manage to locate himself. </s>
<s>  by a painful effort he rolled over on his side. </s>
<s>  below him flowed a wide and sluggish river. </s>
<s>  its unfamiliarity puzzled him. </s>
<s>  slowly he followed it with his eyes, winding in wide sweeps among the bleak, bare hills, bleaker and barer and lower-lying than any hills he had yet encountered. </s>
<s>  slowly, deliberately, without excitement or more than the most casual interest, he followed the course of the strange stream toward the sky-line and saw it emptying into a bright and shining sea. </s>
<s>  he was still unexcited. </s>
<s>  most unusual, he thought, a vision or a mirage - more likely a vision, a trick of his disordered mind. </s>
<s>  he was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea. </s>
<s>  he closed his eyes for a while, then opened them. </s>
<s>  strange how the vision persisted! yet not strange. </s>
<s>  he knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands, just as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle. </s>
<s>  he heard a snuffle behind him - a half-choking gasp or cough. </s>
<s>  very slowly, because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness, he rolled over on his other side. </s>
<s>  he could see nothing near at h but he waited patiently. </s>
<s>  again came the snuffle and cough, and outlined between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf. </s>
<s>  the sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on other wolves. </s>
<s>  the eyes were bleared and bloodshot, the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly. </s>
<s>  the animal blinked continually in the sunshine. </s>
<s>  it seemed sick. </s>
<s>  as he looked it snuffled and coughed again. </s>
<s>  this, at least, was real, he thought, and turned on the other side so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him before by the vision. </s>
<s>  but the sea still shone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible. </s>
<s>  was it reality, after all? he closed his eyes for a long while and thought, and then it came to him. </s>
<s>  he had been making north by east, away from the dease divide and into the coppermine valley. </s>
<s>  this wide and sluggish river was the coppermine. </s>
<s>  that shining sea was the arctic ocean. </s>
<s>  that ship was a whaler, strayed east, far east, from the mouth of the mackenzie, and it was lying at anchor in coronation gulf. </s>
<s>  he remembered the hudson bay company chart he had seen long ago, and it was all clear and reasonable to him. </s>
<s>  he sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs. </s>
<s>  he had worn through the blanket-wrappings, and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw meat. </s>
<s>  his last blanket was gone. </s>
<s>  rifle and knife were both missing. </s>
<s>  he had lost his hat somewhere, with the bunch of matches in the b but the matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper. </s>
<s>  he looked at his watch. </s>
<s>  it marked eleven o'clock and was still running. </s>
<s>  evidently he had kept it wound. </s>
<s>  he was calm and collected. </s>
<s>  though extremely weak, he had no sensation of pain. </s>
<s>  he was not hungry. </s>
<s>  the thought of food was not even pleasant to him, and whatever he did was done by his reason alone. </s>
<s>  he ripped off his pants' legs to the knees and bound them about his feet. </s>
<s>  somehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin bucket. </s>
<s>  he would have some hot water before he began what he foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship. </s>
<s>  his movements were slow. </s>
<s>  he shook as with a palsy. </s>
<s>  when he started to collect dry moss, he found he could not rise to his feet. </s>
<s>  he tried again and again, then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees. </s>
<s>  once he crawled near to the sick wolf. </s>
<s>  the animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way, licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the strength to curl. </s>
<s>  the man noticed that the tongue was not the customary healthy red. </s>
<s>  it was a yellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and half-dry mucus. </s>
<s>  after he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able to st and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed to walk. </s>
<s>  every minute or so he was compelled to rest. </s>
<s>  his steps were feeble and uncertain, just as the wolf's that trailed him were feeble and uncertain. </s>
<s>  and that night, when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness, he knew he was nearer to it by no more than four miles. </s>
<s>  throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf, and now and then the squawking of the caribou calves. </s>
<s>  there was life all around him, but it was strong life, very much alive and well, and he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man's trail in the hope that the man would die first. </s>
<s>  in the morning, on opening his eyes, he beheld it regarding him with a wistful and hungry stare. </s>
<s>  it stood crouched, with tail between its legs, like a miserable and woe-begone dog. </s>
<s>  it shivered in the chill morning wind, and grinned dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no more than a hoarse whisper. </s>
<s>  the sun rose brightly, and all morning the man tottered and fell toward the ship on the shining sea. </s>
<s>  the weather was perfect. </s>
<s>  it was the brief indian summer of the high latitudes. </s>
<s>  it might last a week. </s>
<s>  to-morrow or next day it might he gone. </s>
<s>  in the afternoon the man came upon a trail. </s>
<s>  it was of another man, who did not walk, but who dragged himself on all fours. </s>
<s>  the man thought it might be bill, but he thought in a dull, uninterested way. </s>
<s>  he had no curiosity. </s>
<s>  in fact, sensation and emotion had left him. </s>
<s>  he was no longer susceptible to pain. </s>
<s>  stomach and nerves had gone to sleep. </s>
<s>  yet the life that was in him drove him on. </s>
<s>  he was very weary, but it refused to die. </s>
<s>  it was because it refused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows, drank his hot water, and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf. </s>
<s>  he followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along, and soon came to the end of it - a few fresh-picked bones where the soggy moss was marked by the foot-pads of many wolves. </s>
<s>  he saw a squat moose-hide sack, mate to his own, which had been torn by sharp teeth. </s>
<s>  he picked it up, though its weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers. </s>
<s>  bill had carried it to the last. </s>
<s>  ha! ha! he would have the laugh on bill. </s>
<s>  he would survive and carry it to the ship in the shining sea. </s>
<s>  his mirth was hoarse and ghastly, like a raven's croak, and the sick wolf joined him, howling lugubriously. </s>
<s>  the man ceased suddenly. </s>
<s>  how could he have the laugh on bill if that were bill. </s>
<s>  if those bones, so pinky-white and clean, were bill? he turned away. </s>
<s>  well, bill had deserted him. </s>
<s>  but he would not take the gold, nor would he suck bill's bones. </s>
<s>  bill would have, though, had it been the other way around, he mused as he staggered on. </s>
<s>  he came to a pool of water. </s>
<s>  stooping over in quest of minnows, he jerked his head back as though he had been stung. </s>
<s>  he had caught sight of his reflected face. </s>
<s>  so horrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be shocked. </s>
<s>  there were three minnows in the pool, which was too large to drain. </s>
<s>  and after several ineffectual attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore. </s>
<s>  he was afraid, because of his great weakness, that he might fall in and drown. </s>
<s>  it was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the river astride one of the many drift-logs which lined its sand- spits. </s>
<s>  that day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by three miles. </s>
<s>  the next day by two - for he was crawling now as bill had crawled. </s>
<s>  and the end of the fifth day found the ship still seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day. </s>
<s>  still the indian summer held on, and he continued to crawl and faint, turn and turn about. </s>
<s>  and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at his heels. </s>
<s>  his knees had become raw meat like his feet, and though he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and stones. </s>
<s>  once, glancing back, he saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail, and he saw sharply what his own end might be - unless - unless he could get the wolf. </s>
<s>  then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever played - a sick man that crawled, a sick wolf that limped, two creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and hunting each other's lives. </s>
<s>  had it been a well wolf, it would not have mattered so much to the man. </s>
<s>  but the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and all but dead thing was repugnant to him. </s>
<s>  he was finicky. </s>
<s>  his mind had begun to wander again, and to be perplexed by hallucinations, while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter. </s>
<s>  he was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear. </s>
<s>   the wolf leaped lamely back, losing its footing and falling in its weakness. </s>
<s>  it was ludicrous, but he was not amused. </s>
<s>  nor was he even afraid. </s>
<s>  he was too far gone for that. </s>
<s>  but his mind was for the moment clear, and he lay and considered. </s>
<s>  the ship was no more than four miles away. </s>
<s>  he could see it quite distinctly when he rubbed the mists out of his eyes, and he could see the white sail of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea. </s>
<s>  but he could never crawl those four miles. </s>
<s>  he knew that, and was very calm in the knowledge. </s>
<s>  he knew that he could not crawl half a mile. </s>
<s>  and yet he wanted to live. </s>
<s>  it was unreasonable that he should die after all he had undergone. </s>
<s>  fate asked too much of him. </s>
<s>   dying, he declined to die. </s>
<s>  it was stark madness, perhaps, but in the very grip of death he defied death and refused to die. </s>
<s>  he closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution. </s>
<s>   he steeled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being. </s>
<s>  it was very like a sea, this deadly languor, that rose and rose and drowned his consciousness bit by bit. </s>
<s>  sometimes he was all but submerged, swimming through oblivion with a faltering stroke. </s>
<s>  and again, by some strange alchemy of soul, he would find another shred of will and strike out more strongly. </s>
<s>  without movement he lay on his back, and he could hear, slowly drawing near and nearer, the wheezing intake and output of the sick wolf's breath. </s>
<s>  it drew closer, ever closer, through an infinitude of time, and he did not move. </s>
<s>  it was at his ear. </s>
<s>  the harsh dry tongue grated like sandpaper against his cheek. </s>
<s>  his hands shot out - or at least he willed them to shoot out. </s>
<s>  the fingers were curved like talons, but they closed on empty air. </s>
<s>  swiftness and certitude require strength, and the man had not this strength. </s>
<s>  the patience of the wolf was terrible. </s>
<s>  the man's patience was no less terrible. </s>
<s>  for half a day he lay motionless, fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to feed. </s>
<s>  sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he dreamed long dreams. </s>
<s>  but ever through it all, waking and dreaming, he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress of the tongue. </s>
<s>  he did not hear the breath, and he slipped slowly from some dream to the feel of the tongue along his hand. </s>
<s>  he waited. </s>
<s>  the fangs pressed softly. </s>
<s>  the pressure increased. </s>
<s>  the wolf was exerting its last strength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it had waited so long. </s>
<s>  but the man had waited long, and the lacerated hand closed on the jaw. </s>
<s>  slowly, while the wolf struggled feebly and the hand clutched feebly, the other hand crept across to a grip. </s>
<s>  five minutes later the whole weight of the man's body was on top of the wolf. </s>
<s>  the hands had not sufficient strength to choke the wolf, but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair. </s>
<s>  at the end of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat. </s>
<s>   it was not pleasant. </s>
<s>  it was like molten lead being forced into his stomach, and it was forced by his will alone. </s>
<s>  later the man rolled over on his back and slept. </s>
<s>  there were some members of a scientific expedition on the whale- ship bedford. </s>
<s>  from the deck they remarked a strange object on the shore. </s>
<s>  it was moving down the beach toward the water. </s>
<s>  they were unable to classify it,  being scientific men, they climbed into the whale-boat alongside and went ashore to see. </s>
<s>  and they saw something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man. </s>
<s>   it was blind, unconscious. </s>
<s>  it squirmed along the ground like some monstrous worm. </s>
<s>  most of its efforts were ineffectual, but it was persistent, and it writhed and twisted and went ahead perhaps a score of feet an hour. </s>
<s>  three weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whale-ship bedford, and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks told who he was and what he had undergone. </s>
<s>  he also babbled incoherently of his mother, of sunny southern california, and a home among the orange groves and flowers. </s>
<s>  the days were not many after that when he sat at table with the scientific men and ship's officers. </s>
<s>  he gloated over the spectacle of so much food, watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths of others. </s>
<s>  with the disappearance of each mouthful an expression of deep regret came into his eyes. </s>
<s>  he was quite sane, yet he hated those men at mealtime. </s>
<s>  he was haunted by a fear that the food would not last. </s>
<s>  he inquired of the cook, the cabin-boy, the captain, concerning the food stores. </s>
<s>  they reassured him countless times. </s>
<s>  but he could not believe them, and pried cunningly about the lazarette to see with his own eyes. </s>
<s>  it was noticed that the man was getting fat. </s>
<s>  he grew stouter with each day. </s>
<s>  the scientific men shook their heads and theorized. </s>
<s>   they limited the man at his meals, but still his girth increased and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt. </s>
<s>  the sailors grinned. </s>
<s>  they knew. </s>
<s>  and when the scientific men set a watch on the man, they knew too. </s>
<s>  they saw him slouch for'ard after breakfast,  like a mendicant, with outstretched palm, accost a sailor. </s>
<s>  the sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea biscuit. </s>
<s>  he clutched it avariciously, looked at it as a miser looks at gold, and thrust it into his shirt bosom. </s>
<s>  similar were the donations from other grinning sailors. </s>
<s>  the scientific men were discreet. </s>
<s>  they let him alone. </s>
<s>  but they privily examined his bunk. </s>
<s>  it was lined with hardtack. </s>
<s>  the mattress was stuffed with hardtack. </s>
<s>  every nook and cranny was filled with hardtack. </s>
<s>  yet he was sane. </s>
<s>  he was taking precautions against another possible famine - that was all. </s>
<s>  he would recover from it, the scientific men said. </s>
<s>  and he did, ere the bedford's anchor rumbled down in san francisco bay. </s>
<s>  a day's lodging it was the gosh-dangdest stampede i ever seen. </s>
<s>  a thousand dog- teams hittin' the ice. </s>
<s>  you couldn't see 'm fer smoke. </s>
<s>  two white men an' a swede froze to death that night, an' there was a dozen busted their lungs. </s>
<s>  but didn't i see with my own eyes the bottom of the water-hole? it was yellow with gold like a mustard-plaster. </s>
<s>   that's why i staked the yukon for a minin' claim. </s>
<s>  that's what made the stampede. </s>
<s>  an' then there was nothin' to it. </s>
<s>  that's what i said - nothin' to it. </s>
<s>  an' i ain't got over guessin' yet. </s>
<s>  - narrative of shorty. </s>
<s>  john messner clung with mittened hand to the bucking gee-pole and held the sled in the trail. </s>
<s>  with the other mittened hand he rubbed his cheeks and nose. </s>
<s>  he rubbed his cheeks and nose every little while. </s>
<s>  in point of fact, he rarely ceased from rubbing them, and sometimes, as their numbness increased, he rubbed fiercely. </s>
<s>  his forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap, the flaps of which went over his ears. </s>
<s>  the rest of his face was protected by a thick beard, golden-brown under its coating of frost. </s>
<s>  behind him churned a heavily loaded yukon sled, and before him toiled a string of five dogs. </s>
<s>  the rope by which they dragged the sled rubbed against the side of messner's leg. </s>
<s>  when the dogs swung on a bend in the trail, he stepped over the rope. </s>
<s>  there were many bends, and he was compelled to step over it often. </s>
<s>  sometimes he tripped on the rope, or stumbled, and at all times he was awkward, betraying a weariness so great that the sled now and again ran upon his heels. </s>
<s>  when he came to a straight piece of trail, where the sled could get along for a moment without guidance, he let go the gee-pole and batted his right hand sharply upon the hard wood. </s>
<s>  he found it difficult to keep up the circulation in that hand. </s>
<s>  but while he pounded the one h he never ceased from rubbing his nose and cheeks with the other. </s>
<s>  "it's too cold to travel, anyway," he said. </s>
<s>  he spoke aloud, after the manner of men who are much by themselves. </s>
<s>  "only a fool would travel at such a temperature. </s>
<s>  if it isn't eighty below, it's because it's seventy-nine. </s>
<s> " he pulled out his watch, and after some fumbling got it back into the breast pocket of his thick woollen jacket. </s>
<s>  then he surveyed the heavens and ran his eye along the white sky-line to the south. </s>
<s>  "twelve o'clock," he mumbled, "a clear sky, and no sun. </s>
<s> " he plodded on silently for ten minutes, and then, as though there had been no lapse in his speech, he added: "and no ground covered, and it's too cold to travel. </s>
<s> " suddenly he yelled "whoa!" at the dogs, and stopped. </s>
<s>  he seemed in a wild panic over his right h and proceeded to hammer it furiously against the gee-pole. </s>
<s>  "you - poor - devils!" he addressed the dogs, which had dropped down heavily on the ice to rest. </s>
<s>  his was a broken, jerky utterance, caused by the violence with which he hammered his numb hand upon the wood. </s>
<s>  "what have you done anyway that a two-legged other animal should come along, break you to harness, curb all your natural proclivities, and make slave-beasts out of you?" he rubbed his nose, not reflectively, but savagely, in order to drive the blood into it, and urged the dogs to their work again. </s>
<s>   he travelled on the frozen surface of a great river. </s>
<s>  behind him it stretched away in a mighty curve of many miles, losing itself in a fantastic jumble of mountains, snow-covered and silent. </s>
<s>  ahead of him the river split into many channels to accommodate the freight of islands it carried on its breast. </s>
<s>  these islands were silent and white. </s>
<s>  no animals nor humming insects broke the silence. </s>
<s>  no birds flew in the chill air. </s>
<s>  there was no sound of man, no mark of the handiwork of man. </s>
<s>  the world slept, and it was like the sleep of death. </s>
<s>  john messner seemed succumbing to the apathy of it all. </s>
<s>  the frost was benumbing his spirit. </s>
<s>  he plodded on with bowed head, unobservant, mechanically rubbing nose and cheeks, and batting his steering hand against the gee-pole in the straight trail-stretches. </s>
<s>  but the dogs were observant, and suddenly they stopped, turning their heads and looking back at their master out of eyes that were wistful and questioning. </s>
<s>  their eyelashes were frosted white, as were their muzzles, and they had all the seeming of decrepit old age, what of the frost-rime and exhaustion. </s>
<s>  the man was about to urge them on, when he checked himself, roused up with an effort, and looked around. </s>
<s>  the dogs had stopped beside a water-hole, not a fissure, but a hole man-made, chopped laboriously with an axe through three and a half feet of ice. </s>
<s>  a thick skin of new ice showed that it had not been used for some time. </s>
<s>  messner glanced about him. </s>
<s>  the dogs were already pointing the way, each wistful and hoary muzzle turned toward the dim snow- path that left the main river trail and climbed the bank of the island. </s>
<s>  "all right, you sore-footed brutes," he said. </s>
<s>  "i'll investigate. </s>
<s>   you're not a bit more anxious to quit than i am. </s>
<s> " he climbed the bank and disappeared. </s>
<s>  the dogs did not lie down, but on their feet eagerly waited his return. </s>
<s>  he came back to them, took a hauling-rope from the front of the sled, and put it around his shoulders. </s>
<s>  then he gee'd the dogs to the right and put them at the bank on the run. </s>
<s>  it was a stiff pull, but their weariness fell from them as they crouched low to the snow, whining with eagerness and gladness as they struggled upward to the last ounce of effort in their bodies. </s>
<s>  when a dog slipped or faltered, the one behind nipped his hind quarters. </s>
<s>  the man shouted encouragement and threats, and threw all his weight on the hauling-rope. </s>
<s>  they cleared the bank with a rush, swung to the left, and dashed up to a small log cabin. </s>
<s>  it was a deserted cabin of a single room, eight feet by ten on the inside. </s>
<s>  messner unharnessed the animals, unloaded his sled and took possession. </s>
<s>  the last chance wayfarer had left a supply of firewood. </s>
<s>  messner set up his light sheet-iron stove and starred a fire. </s>
<s>  he put five sun-cured salmon into the oven to thaw out for the dogs, and from the water-hole filled his coffee-pot and cooking-pail. </s>
<s>  while waiting for the water to boil, he held his face over the stove. </s>
<s>  the moisture from his breath had collected on his beard and frozen into a great mass of ice, and this he proceeded to thaw out. </s>
<s>   as it melted and dropped upon the stove it sizzled and rose about him in steam. </s>
<s>  he helped the process with his fingers, working loose small ice-chunks that fell rattling to the floor. </s>
<s>  a wild outcry from the dogs without did not take him from his task. </s>
<s>   he heard the wolfish snarling and yelping of strange dogs and the sound of voices. </s>
<s>  a knock came on the door. </s>
<s>  "come in," messner called, in a voice muffled because at the moment he was sucking loose a fragment of ice from its anchorage on his upper lip. </s>
<s>  the door opened,  gazing out of his cloud of steam, he saw a man and a woman pausing on the threshold. </s>
<s>  "come in," he said peremptorily, "and shut the door!" peering through the steam, he could make out but little of their personal appearance. </s>
<s>  the nose and cheek strap worn by the woman and the trail-wrappings about her head allowed only a pair of black eyes to be seen. </s>
<s>  the man was dark-eyed and smooth-shaven all except his mustache, which was so iced up as to hide his mouth. </s>
<s>  "we just wanted to know if there is any other cabin around here," he said, at the same time glancing over the unfurnished state of the room. </s>
<s>  "we thought this cabin was empty. </s>
<s> " "it isn't my cabin," messner answered. </s>
<s>  "i just found it a few minutes ago. </s>
<s>  come right in and camp. </s>
<s>  plenty of room, and you won't need your stove. </s>
<s>  there's room for all. </s>
<s> " at the sound of his voice the woman peered at him with quick curiousness. </s>
<s>  "get your things off," her companion said to her. </s>
<s>  "i'll unhitch and get the water so we can start cooking. </s>
<s> " messner took the thawed salmon outside and fed his dogs. </s>
<s>  he had to guard them against the second team of dogs, and when he had re‰ntered the cabin the other man had unpacked the sled and fetched water. </s>
<s>  messner's pot was boiling. </s>
<s>  he threw in the coffee, settled it with half a cup of cold water, and took the pot from the stove. </s>
<s>   he thawed some sour-dough biscuits in the oven, at the same time heating a pot of beans he had boiled the night before and that had ridden frozen on the sled all morning. </s>
<s>  removing his utensils from the stove, so as to give the newcomers a chance to cook, he proceeded to take his meal from the top of his grub-box, himself sitting on his bed-roll. </s>
<s>  between mouthfuls he talked trail and dogs with the man, who, with head over the stove, was thawing the ice from his mustache. </s>
<s>  there were two bunks in the cabin, and into one of them, when he had cleared his lip, the stranger tossed his bed-roll. </s>
<s>  "we'll sleep here," he said, "unless you prefer this bunk. </s>
<s>  you're the first comer and you have first choice, you know. </s>
<s> " "that's all right," messner answered. </s>
<s>  "one bunk's just as good as the other. </s>
<s> " he spread his own bedding in the second bunk, and sat down on the edge. </s>
<s>  the stranger thrust a physician's small travelling case under his blankets at one end to serve for a pillow. </s>
<s>  "doctor?" messner asked. </s>
<s>  "yes," came the answer, "but i assure you i didn't come into the klondike to practise. </s>
<s> " the woman busied herself with cooking, while the man sliced bacon and fired the stove. </s>
<s>  the light in the cabin was dim, filtering through in a small window made of onion-skin writing paper and oiled with bacon grease, so that john messner could not make out very well what the woman looked like. </s>
<s>  not that he tried. </s>
<s>  he seemed to have no interest in her. </s>
<s>  but she glanced curiously from time to time into the dark corner where he sat. </s>
<s>  "oh, it's a great life," the doctor proclaimed enthusiastically, pausing from sharpening his knife on the stovepipe. </s>
<s>  "what i like about it is the struggle, the endeavor with one's own hands, the primitiveness of it, the realness. </s>
<s> " "the temperature is real enough," messner laughed. </s>
<s>  "do you know how cold it actually is?" the doctor demanded. </s>
<s>  the other shook his head. </s>
<s>  "well, i'll tell you. </s>
<s>  seventy-four below zero by spirit thermometer on the sled. </s>
<s> " "that's one hundred and six below freezing point - too cold for travelling, eh?" "practically suicide," was the doctor's verdict. </s>
<s>  "one exerts himself. </s>
<s>  he breathes heavily, taking into his lungs the frost itself. </s>
<s>  it chills his lungs, freezes the edges of the tissues. </s>

<s> " "i say, tess," he said, the next moment, "don't you think that coffee's boiled long enough!" at the sound of the woman's name, john messner became suddenly alert. </s>
<s>  he looked at her quickly, while across his face shot a haunting expression, the ghost of some buried misery achieving swift resurrection. </s>
<s>  but the next moment, and by an effort of will, the ghost was laid again. </s>
<s>  his face was as placid as before, though he was still alert, dissatisfied with what the feeble light had shown him of the woman's face. </s>
<s>  automatically, her first act had been to set the coffee-pot back. </s>
<s>   it was not until she had done this that she glanced at messner. </s>
<s>   but already he had composed himself. </s>
<s>  she saw only a man sitting on the edge of the bunk and incuriously studying the toes of his moccasins. </s>
<s>   as she turned casually to go about her cooking, he shot another swift look at her, and she, glancing as swiftly back, caught his look. </s>
<s>  he shifted on past her to the doctor, though the slightest smile curled his lip in appreciation of the way she had trapped him. </s>
<s>  she drew a candle from the grub-box and lighted it. </s>
<s>  one look at her illuminated face was enough for messner. </s>
<s>  in the small cabin the widest limit was only a matter of several steps, and the next moment she was alongside of him. </s>
<s>  she deliberately held the candle close to his face and stared at him out of eyes wide with fear and recognition. </s>
<s>  he smiled quietly back at her. </s>
<s>  "what are you looking for, tess?" the doctor called. </s>
<s>  "hairpins," she replied, passing on and rummaging in a clothes-bag on the bunk. </s>
<s>  they served their meal on their grub-box, sitting on messner's grub-box and facing him. </s>
<s>  he had stretched out on his bunk to rest, lying on his side, his head on his arm. </s>
<s>  in the close quarters it was as though the three were together at table. </s>
<s>  "what part of the states do you come from?" messner asked. </s>
<s>  "san francisco," answered the doctor. </s>
<s>  "i have been in here two years, though. </s>
<s> " "i hail from california myself," was messner's announcement. </s>
<s>  the woman looked at him appealingly, but he smiled and went on: "berkeley, you know. </s>
<s> " the other man was becoming interested. </s>
<s>  "u. </s>
<s>  c. </s>
<s> ?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "yes, class of '86. </s>
<s> " "i meant faculty," the doctor explained. </s>
<s>  "you remind me of the type. </s>
<s> " "sorry to hear you say so," messner smiled back. </s>
<s>  "i would prefer being taken for a prospector or a dog-musher. </s>
<s> " "i don't think he looks any more like a professor than you do a doctor," the woman broke in. </s>
<s>  "thank you," said messner. </s>
<s>  then, turning to her companion, "by the way, doctor, what is your name, if i may ask?" "haythorne, if you'll take my word for it. </s>
<s>  i gave up cards with civilization. </s>
<s> " "and mrs. </s>
<s>  haythorne," messner smiled and bowed. </s>
<s>  she flashed a look at him that was more anger than appeal. </s>
<s>  haythorne was about to ask the other's name. </s>
<s>  his mouth had opened to form the question when messner cut him off. </s>
<s>  "come to think of it, doctor, you may possibly be able to satisfy my curiosity. </s>
<s>  there was a sort of scandal in faculty circles some two or three years ago. </s>
<s>  the wife of one of the english professors - er, if you will pardon me, mrs. </s>
<s>  haythorne - disappeared with some san francisco doctor, i understood, though his name does not just now come to my lips. </s>
<s>  do you remember the incident?" haythorne nodded his head. </s>
<s>  "made quite a stir at the time. </s>
<s>  his name was womble - graham womble. </s>
<s>  he had a magnificent practice. </s>
<s>  i knew him somewhat. </s>
<s> " "well, what i was trying to get at was what had become of them. </s>
<s>  i was wondering if you had heard. </s>
<s>  they left no trace, hide nor hair. </s>
<s> " "he covered his tracks cunningly. </s>
<s> " haythorne cleared his throat. </s>
<s>   "there was rumor that they went to the south seas - were lost on a trading schooner in a typhoon, or something like that. </s>
<s> " "i never heard that," messner said. </s>
<s>  "you remember the case, mrs. </s>
<s>  haythorne?" "perfectly," she answered, in a voice the control of which was in amazing contrast to the anger that blazed in the face she turned aside so that haythorne might not see. </s>
<s>  the latter was again on the verge of asking his name, when messner remarked: "this dr. </s>
<s>  womble, i have heard he was very handsome, and - er - quite a success, so to say, with the ladies. </s>
<s> " "well, if he was, he finished himself off by that affair," haythorne grumbled. </s>
<s>  "and the woman was a termagant - at least so i have been told. </s>
<s>  it was generally accepted in berkeley that she made life - er - not exactly paradise for her husband. </s>
<s> " "i never heard that," haythorne rejoined. </s>
<s>  "in san francisco the talk was all the other way. </s>
<s> " "woman sort of a martyr, eh? - crucified on the cross of matrimony?" the doctor nodded. </s>
<s>  messner's gray eyes were mildly curious as he went on: "that was to be expected - two sides to the shield. </s>
<s>  living in berkeley i only got the one side. </s>
<s>  she was a great deal in san francisco, it seems. </s>
<s> " "some coffee, please," haythorne said. </s>
<s>  the woman refilled his mug, at the same time breaking into light laughter. </s>
<s>  "you're gossiping like a pair of beldames," she chided them. </s>
<s>  "it's so interesting," messner smiled at her, then returned to the doctor. </s>
<s>  "the husband seems then to have had a not very savory reputation in san francisco?" "on the contrary, he was a moral prig," haythorne blurted out, with apparently undue warmth. </s>
<s>  "he was a little scholastic shrimp without a drop of red blood in his body. </s>
<s> " "did you know him?" "never laid eyes on him. </s>
<s>  i never knocked about in university circles. </s>
<s> " "one side of the shield again," messner said, with an air of weighing the matter judicially. </s>
<s>  while he did not amount to much, it is true - that is, physically - i would hardly say he was as bad as all that. </s>
<s>  he did take an active interest in student athletics. </s>
<s>   and he had some talent. </s>
<s>  he once wrote a nativity play that brought him quite a bit of local appreciation. </s>
<s>  i have heard, also, that he was slated for the head of the english department, only the affair happened and he resigned and went away. </s>
<s>  it quite broke his career, or so it seemed. </s>
<s>  at any rate, on our side the shield, it was considered a knock-out blow to him. </s>
<s>  it was thought he cared a great deal for his wife. </s>
<s> " haythorne, finishing his mug of coffee, grunted uninterestedly and lighted his pipe. </s>
<s>  "it was fortunate they had no children," messner continued. </s>
<s>  but haythorne, with a glance at the stove, pulled on his cap and mittens. </s>
<s>  "i am going out to get some wood," he said. </s>
<s>  "then i can take off my moccasins and he comfortable. </s>
<s> " the door slammed behind him. </s>
<s>  for a long minute there was silence. </s>
<s>   the man continued in the same position on the bed. </s>
<s>  the woman sat on the grub-box, facing him. </s>
<s>  "what are you going to do?" she asked abruptly. </s>
<s>  messner looked at her with lazy indecision. </s>
<s>  "what do you think i ought to do? nothing scenic, i hope. </s>
<s>  you see i am stiff and trail-sore, and this bunk is so restful. </s>
<s> " she gnawed her lower lip and fumed dumbly. </s>
<s>  "but - " she began vehemently, then clenched her hands and stopped. </s>
<s>  "i hope you don't want me to kill mr. </s>
<s>  -er - haythorne," he said gently, almost pleadingly. </s>
<s>  "it would be most distressing,  i assure you, really it is unnecessary. </s>
<s> " "but you must do something," she cried. </s>
<s>  "on the contrary, it is quite conceivable that i do not have to do anything. </s>
<s> " "you would stay here?" he nodded. </s>
<s>  she glanced desperately around the cabin and at the bed unrolled on the other bunk. </s>
<s>  "night is coming on. </s>
<s>  you can't stop here. </s>
<s>  you can't! i tell you, you simply can't!" "of course i can. </s>
<s>  i might remind you that i found this cabin first and that you are my guests. </s>
<s> " again her eyes travelled around the room, and the terror in them leaped up at sight of the other bunk. </s>
<s>  "then we'll have to go," she announced decisively. </s>
<s>  "impossible. </s>
<s>  you have a dry, hacking cough - the sort mr. </s>
<s>  - er - haythorne so aptly described. </s>
<s>  you've already slightly chilled your lungs. </s>
<s>  besides, he is a physician and knows. </s>
<s>  he would never permit it. </s>
<s> " "then what are you going to do?" she demanded again, with a tense, quiet utterance that boded an outbreak. </s>
<s>  messner regarded her in a way that was almost paternal, what of the profundity of pity and patience with which he contrived to suffuse it. </s>
<s>  "my dear theresa, as i told you before, i don't know. </s>
<s>  i really haven't thought about it. </s>
<s> " "oh! you drive me mad!" she sprang to her feet, wringing her hands in impotent wrath. </s>
<s>  "you never used to be this way. </s>
<s> " "i used to be all softness and gentleness," he nodded concurrence. </s>
<s>   "was that why you left me?" "you are so different, so dreadfully calm. </s>
<s>  you frighten me. </s>
<s>  i feel you have something terrible planned all the while. </s>
<s>  but whatever you do, don't do anything rash. </s>
<s>  don't get excited - " "i don't get excited any more," he interrupted. </s>
<s>  "not since you went away. </s>
<s> " "you have improved - remarkably," she retorted. </s>
<s>  he smiled acknowledgment. </s>
<s>  "while i am thinking about what i shall do, i'll tell you what you will have to do - tell mr. </s>
<s>  - er - haythorne who i am. </s>
<s>  it may make our stay in this cabin more - may i say, sociable?" "why have you followed me into this frightful country?" she asked irrelevantly. </s>
<s>  "don't think i came here looking for you, theresa. </s>
<s>  your vanity shall not be tickled by any such misapprehension. </s>
<s>  our meeting is wholly fortuitous. </s>
<s>  i broke with the life academic and i had to go somewhere. </s>
<s>  to be honest, i came into the klondike because i thought it the place you were least liable to be in. </s>
<s> " there was a fumbling at the latch, then the door swung in and haythorne entered with an armful of firewood. </s>
<s>  at the first warning, theresa began casually to clear away the dishes. </s>
<s>   haythorne went out again after more wood. </s>
<s>  "why didn't you introduce us?" messner queried. </s>
<s>  "i'll tell him," she replied, with a toss of her head. </s>
<s>  "don't think i am afraid. </s>
<s> " "i never knew you to be afraid, very much, of anything. </s>
<s> " "and i am not afraid of confession, either," she said, with softening face and voice. </s>
<s>  "in your case, i fear, confession is exploitation by indirection, profit-making by ruse, self-aggrandizement at the expense of god. </s>
<s> " "don't be literary," she pouted, with growing tenderness. </s>
<s>  "i never did like epigrammatic discussion. </s>
<s>  besides, i am not afraid to ask you to forgive me. </s>
<s> " "there is nothing to forgive, theresa. </s>
<s>  i really should thank you. </s>
<s>   true, at first i suffered. </s>
<s>  and then, with all the graciousness of spring, it dawned upon me that i was happy, very happy. </s>
<s>  it was a most amazing discovery. </s>
<s> " "but what if i should return to you?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "i should"  between him and his prospects. </s>
<s>  you think so, mr headstone?' conscious that his pupil-teacher was looking for his answer, that he himself had suggested the boy's keeping aloof from this sister, now seen for the first time face to face, bradley headstone stammered: 'your brother is very much occupied, you know. </s>
<s>  he has to work hard. </s>
<s>  one cannot but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work, the better for his future. </s>
<s>  when he shall have established himself, why then--it will be another thing then. </s>
<s> ' lizzie shook her head again, and returned, with a quiet smile: 'i always advised him as you advise him. </s>
<s>  did i not, charley?well, never mind that now,' said the boy. </s>
<s>  'how are you getting on?very well, charley. </s>
<s>  i want for nothing. </s>
<s> you have your own room here?oh yes. </s>
<s>  upstairs. </s>
<s>  and it's quiet, and pleasant, and airy. </s>
<s> and she always has the use of this room for visitors,' said the person of the house, screwing up one of her little bony fists, like an opera-glass, and looking through it, with her eyes and her chin in that quaint accordance. </s>
<s>  'always this room for visitors. </s>
<s>  haven't you, lizzie dear?' it happened that bradley headstone noticed a very slight action of lizzie hexam's h as though it checked the doll's dressmaker. </s>
<s>  and it happened that the latter noticed him in the same instant. </s>
<s>  for she made a double eyeglass of her two hands, looked at him through it, and cried, with a waggish shake of her head: 'aha! caught you spying, did i?' it might have fallen out so, any way. </s>
<s>  but bradley headstone also noticed that immediately after this, lizzie, who had not taken off her bonnet, rather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should go out into the air. </s>
<s>  they went out. </s>
<s>  the visitors saying good-night to the doll's dressmaker, whom they left, leaning back in her chair with her arms crossed, singing to herself in a sweet thoughtful little voice. </s>
<s>  'i'll saunter on by the river,' said bradley. </s>
<s>  'you will be glad to talk together. </s>
<s> ' as his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows, the boy said to his sister, petulantly: 'when are you going to settle yourself in some christian sort of place, liz? i thought you were going to do it before now. </s>
<s> i am very well where i am, charley. </s>
<s> very well where you are! i am ashamed to have brought mr headstone with me. </s>
<s>  how came you to get into such company as that little witch's?by chance at first, as it seemed, charley. </s>
<s>  but i think it must have been by something more than chance, for that child--you remember the bills upon the walls at home?confound the bills upon the walls at home! i want to forget the bills upon the walls at home, and it would be better for you to do the same,' grumbled the boy. </s>
<s>  'well. </s>
<s>  what of them?this child is the grandchild of the old man. </s>
<s> what old man?the terrible drunken old man, in the list slippers and the night- cap. </s>
<s> ' the boy asked, rubbing his nose in a manner that half expressed vexation at hearing so much, and half curiosity to hear more: 'how came you to make that out? what a girl you are!the child's father is employed by the house that employs me. </s>
<s>  that's how i came to know it, charley. </s>
<s>  the father is like his own father, a weak wretched trembling creature, falling to pieces, never sober. </s>
<s>  but a good workman too, at the work he does. </s>
<s>  the mother is dead. </s>
<s>  this poor ailing little creature has come to be what she is, surrounded by drunken people from her cradle--if she ever had one, charley. </s>
<s> i don't see what you have to do with her, for all that,' said the boy. </s>
<s>  'don't you, charley?' the boy looked doggedly at the river. </s>
<s>  they were at millbank, and the river rolled on their left. </s>
<s>  his sister gently touched him on the shoulder, and pointed to it. </s>
<s>  'any compensation--restitution--never mind the word, you know my meaning. </s>
<s>  father's grave. </s>
<s> ' but he did not respond with any tenderness. </s>
<s>  after a moody silence he broke out in an ill-used tone: 'it'll be a very hard thing, liz, if, when i am trying my best to get up in the world, you pull me back. </s>
<s> i, charley?yes, you, liz. </s>
<s>  why can't you let bygones be bygones? why can't you, as mr headstone said to me this very evening about another matter, leave well alone? what we have got to do, is, to turn our faces full in our new direction, and keep straight on. </s>
<s> and never look back? not even to try to make some amends?you are such a dreamer,' said the boy, with his former petulance. </s>
<s>  'it was all very well when we sat before the fire--when we looked into the hollow down by the flare--but we are looking into the real world, now. </s>
<s> ah, we were looking into the real world then, charley!i understand what you mean by that, but you are not justified in it. </s>
<s>  i don't want, as i raise myself to shake you off, liz. </s>
<s>  i want to carry you up with me. </s>
<s>  that's what i want to do, and mean to do. </s>
<s>  i know what i owe you. </s>
<s>  i said to mr headstone this very evening, "after all, my sister got me here. </s>
<s> " well, then. </s>
<s>  don't pull me back, and hold me down. </s>
<s>  that's all i ask, and surely that's not unconscionable. </s>
<s> ' she had kept a steadfast look upon him, and she answered with composure: 'i am not here selfishly, charley. </s>
<s>  to please myself i could not be too far from that river. </s>
<s> nor could you be too far from it to please me. </s>
<s>  let us get quit of it equally. </s>
<s>  why should you linger about it any more than i? i give it a wide berth. </s>
<s> i can't get away from it, i think,' said lizzie, passing her hand across her forehead. </s>
<s>  'it's no purpose of mine that i live by it still. </s>
<s> there you go, liz! dreaming again! you lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drunken--tailor, i suppose--or something of the sort, and a little crooked antic of a child, or old person, or whatever it is, and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there. </s>
<s>  now, do be more practical. </s>
<s> ' she had been practical enough with him, in suffering and striving for him. </s>
<s>  but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder--not reproachfully--and tapped it twice or thrice. </s>
<s>  she had been used to do so, to soothe him when she carried him about, a child as heavy as herself. </s>
<s>  tears started to his eyes. </s>
<s>  'upon my word, liz,' drawing the back of his hand across them, 'i mean to be a good brother to you, and to prove that i know what i owe you. </s>
<s>  all i say is, that i hope you'll control your fancies a little, on my account. </s>
<s>  i'll get a school, and then you must come and live with me, and you'll have to control your fancies then, so why not now? now, say i haven't vexed you. </s>
<s> you haven't, charley, you haven't. </s>
<s> and say i haven't hurt you. </s>
<s> you haven't, charley. </s>
<s> ' but this answer was less ready. </s>
<s>  'say you are sure i didn't mean to. </s>
<s>  come! there's mr headstone stopping and looking over the wall at the tide, to hint that it's time to go. </s>
<s>  kiss me, and tell me that you know i didn't mean to hurt you. </s>
<s> ' she told him so, and they embraced, and walked on and came up with the schoolmaster. </s>
<s>  'but we go your sister's way,' he remarked, when the boy told him he was ready. </s>
<s>  and with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her his arm. </s>
<s>  her hand was just within it, when she drew it back. </s>
<s>  he looked round with a start, as if he thought she had detected something that repelled her, in the momentary touch. </s>
<s>  'i will not go in just yet,' said lizzie. </s>
<s>  'and you have a distance before you, and will walk faster without me. </s>
<s> ' being by this time close to vauxhall bridge, they resolved, in consequence, to take that way over the thames, and they left her. </s>
<s>  bradley headstone giving her his hand at parting, and she thanking him for his care of her brother. </s>
<s>  the master and the pupil walked on, rapidly and silently. </s>
<s>  they had nearly crossed the bridge, when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards them, with a cigar in his mouth, his coat thrown back, and his hands behind him. </s>
<s>  something in the careless manner of this person, and in a certain lazily arrogant air with which he approached, holding possession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed, instantly caught the boy's attention. </s>
<s>  as the gentleman passed the boy looked at him narrowly, and then stood still, looking after him. </s>
<s>  'who is it that you stare after?' asked bradley. </s>
<s>  'why!' said the boy, with a confused and pondering frown upon his face, 'it is that wrayburn one!' bradley headstone scrutinized the boy as closely as the boy had scrutinized the gentleman. </s>
<s>  'i beg your pardon, mr headstone, but i couldn't help wondering what in the world brought him here!' though he said it as if his wonder were past--at the same time resuming the walk--it was not lost upon the master that he looked over his shoulder after speaking, and that the same perplexed and pondering frown was heavy on his face. </s>
<s>  'you don't appear to like your friend, hexam?i don't like him,' said the boy. </s>
<s>  'why not?he took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way, the first time i ever saw him,' said the boy. </s>
<s>  'again, why?for nothing. </s>
<s>  or--it's much the same--because something i happened to say about my sister didn't happen to please him. </s>
<s> then he knows your sister?he didn't at that time,' said the boy, still moodily pondering. </s>
<s>  'does now?' the boy had so lost himself that he looked at mr bradley headstone as they walked on side by side, without attempting to reply until the question had been repeated. </s>
<s>  then he nodded and answered, 'yes, sir. </s>
<s> going to see her, i dare say. </s>
<s> it can't be!' said the boy, quickly. </s>
<s>  'he doesn't know her well enough. </s>
<s>  i should like to catch him at it!' when they had walked on for a time, more rapidly than before, the master said, clasping the pupil's arm between the elbow and the shoulder with his hand: 'you were going to tell me something about that person. </s>
<s>  what did you say his name was?wrayburn. </s>
<s>  mr eugene wrayburn. </s>
<s>  he is what they call a barrister, with nothing to do. </s>
<s>  the first time be came to our old place was when my father was alive. </s>
<s>  he came on business. </s>
<s>  not that it was his business--he never had any business--he was brought by a friend of his. </s>
<s> and the other times?there was only one other time that i know of. </s>
<s>  when my father was killed by accident, he chanced to be one of the finders. </s>
<s>  he was mooning about, i suppose, taking liberties with people's chins. </s>
<s>  but there he was, somehow. </s>
<s>  he brought the news home to my sister early in the morning, and brought miss abbey potterson, a neighbour, to help break it to her. </s>
<s>  he was mooning about the house when i was fetched home in the afternoon--they didn't know where to find me till my sister could be brought round sufficiently to tell them--and then he mooned away. </s>
<s> and is that all?that's all, sir. </s>
<s> ' bradley headstone gradually released the boy's arm, as if he were thoughtful, and they walked on side by side as before. </s>
<s>  after a long silence between them, bradley resumed the talk. </s>
<s>  'i suppose--your sister--' with a curious break both before and after the words, 'has received hardly any teaching, hexam?hardly any, sir. </s>
<s> sacrificed, no doubt, to her father's objections. </s>
<s>  i remember them in your case. </s>
<s>  yet--your sister--scarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant person. </s>
<s> lizzie has as much thought as the best, mr headstone. </s>
<s>  too much, perhaps, without teaching. </s>
<s>  i used to call the fire at home, her books, for she was always full of fancies--sometimes quite wise fancies, considering--when she sat looking at it. </s>
<s> i don't like that,' said bradley headstone. </s>
<s>  his pupil was a little surprised by this striking in with so sudden and decided and emotional an objection, but took it as a proof of the master's interest in himself. </s>
<s>  it emboldened him to say: 'i have never brought myself to mention it openly to you, mr headstone, and you're my witness that i couldn't even make up my mind to take it from you before we came out to-night. </s>
<s>  but it's a painful thing to think that if i get on as well as you hope, i shall be--i won't say disgraced, because i don't mean disgraced—but-- rather put to the blush if it was known--by a sister who has been very good to me. </s>
<s> yes,' said bradley headstone in a slurring way, for his mind scarcely seemed to touch that point, so smoothly did it glide to another, 'and there is this possibility to consider. </s>
<s>  some man who had worked his way might come to admire--your sister--and might even in time bring himself to think of marrying--your sister--and it would be a sad drawback and a heavy penalty upon him, if. </s>
<s>  overcoming in his mind other inequalities of condition and other considerations against it, this inequality and this consideration remained in full force. </s>
<s> that's much my own meaning, sir. </s>
<s> ay, ay,' said bradley headstone, 'but you spoke of a mere brother. </s>
<s>  now, the case i have supposed would be a much stronger case. </s>
<s>  because an admirer, a husb would form the connexion voluntarily, besides being obliged to proclaim it: which a brother is not. </s>
<s>  after all, you know, it must be said of you that you couldn't help yourself: while it would be said of him, with equal reason, that he could. </s>
<s> that's true, sir. </s>
<s>  sometimes since lizzie was left free by father's death, i have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more than enough to pass muster. </s>
<s>  and sometimes i have even thought that perhaps miss peecher--for the purpose, i would advise not miss peecher,' bradley headstone struck in with a recurrence of his late decision of manner. </s>
<s>  'would you be so kind as to think of it for me, mr headstone?yes, hexam, yes. </s>
<s>  i'll think of it. </s>
<s>  i'll think maturely of it. </s>
<s>  i'll think well of it. </s>
<s> ' their walk was almost a silent one afterwards, until it ended at the school-house. </s>
<s>  there, one of neat miss peecher's little windows, like the eyes in needles, was illuminated, and in a corner near it sat mary anne watching, while miss peecher at the table stitched at the neat little body she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing. </s>

<s> ' in about a minute, mary anne again hailed. </s>
<s>  'yes, mary anne?gone in and locked his door, ma'am. </s>

<s>  'well lizzie-mizzie-wizzie,' said she, breaking off in her song. </s>
<s>  'what's the news out of doors?what's the news in doors?' returned lizzie, playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll's dressmaker. </s>
<s>  'let me see, said the blind man. </s>
<s>  why the last news is, that i don't mean to marry your brother. </s>
<s> no?no-o,' shaking her head and her chin. </s>

<s>  she stood it on the mantelshelf, remote from the dressmaker's eyes, and then put the room door open, and the house door open, and turned the little low chair and its occupant towards the outer air. </s>
<s>  it was a sultry night, and this was a fine-weather arrangement when the day's work was done. </s>
<s>  to complete it, she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair, and protectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her. </s>
<s>  'this is what your loving jenny wren calls the best time in the day and night,' said the person of the house. </s>
<s>  her real name was fanny cleaver. </s>
<s>  but she had long ago chosen to bestow upon herself the appellation of miss jenny wren. </s>
<s>  'i have been thinking,' jenny went on, 'as i sat at work to-day, what a thing it would be, if i should be able to have your company till i am married, or at least courted. </s>

<s>  i'll trot him about, i can tell him!' jenny wren had her personal vanities--happily for her--and no intentions were stronger in her breast than the various trials and torments that were, in the fulness of time, to be inflicted upon 'him. </s>

<s> don't you think you are rather hard upon him?' asked her friend, smiling, and smoothing her hair. </s>
<s>  'not a bit,' replied the sage miss wren, with an air of vast experience. </s>
<s>  'my dear, they don't care for you, those fellows, if you're not hard upon 'em. </s>

<s>  'aha!   who comes here?   a grenadier. </s>
<s>    what does he want?   a pot of beer. </s>
<s>  and nothing else in the world, my dear!' a man's figure paused on the pavement at the outer door. </s>

<s>  'you may come in, if you're good. </s>

<s> " "c'est le caractere des gens de guerre," said cora, with admirable self-possession. </s>
<s>  "adieu, mon ami. </s>
<s>  je vous souhaiterais un devoir plus agreable a remplir. </s>
<s> " the soldier made a low and humble acknowledgment for her civility. </s>
<s>  and heyward adding a "bonne nuit, mon camarade," they moved deliberately forward, leaving the sentinel pacing the banks of the silent pond, little suspecting an enemy of so much effrontery, and humming to himself those words which were recalled to his mind by the sight of women,  perhaps, by recollections of his own distant and beautiful france: "vive le vin, vive l'amour," etc. </s>
<s> , etc. </s>
<s>  "'tis well you understood the knave!" whispered the scout, when they had gained a little distance from the place, and letting his rifle fall into the hollow of his arm again. </s>
<s>  "i soon saw that he was one of them uneasy frenchers. </s>
<s>  and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his wishes kind, or a place might have been found for his bones among those of his countrymen. </s>
<s> " he was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little basin, as though, in truth, the spirits of the departed lingered about their watery sepulcher. </s>
<s>  "surely it was of flesh," continued the scout. </s>
<s>  "no spirit could handle its arms so steadily. </s>
<s> " "it was of flesh. </s>
<s>  but whether the poor fellow still belongs to this world may well be doubted," said heyward, glancing his eyes around him, and missing chingachgook from their little band. </s>
<s>  another groan more faint than the former was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into the water, and all was still again as if the borders of the dreary pool had never been awakened from the silence of creation. </s>
<s>  while they yet hesitated in uncertainty, the form of the indian was seen gliding out of the thicket. </s>
<s>  as the chief rejoined them, with one hand he attached the reeking scalp of the unfortunate young frenchman to his girdle, and with the other he replaced the knife and tomahawk that had drunk his blood. </s>
<s>  he then took his wonted station, with the air of a man who believed he had done a deed of merit. </s>
<s>  the scout dropped one end of his rifle to the earth, and leaning his hands on the other, he stood musing in profound silence. </s>
<s>  then, shaking his head in a mournful manner, he muttered: "'twould have been a cruel and an unhuman act for a white- skin. </s>
<s>  but 'tis the gift and natur' of an indian, and i suppose it should not be denied. </s>
<s>  i could wish, though it had befallen an accursed mingo, rather than that gay young boy from the old countries. </s>
<s> " "enough!" said heyward, apprehensive the unconscious sisters might comprehend the nature of the detention, and conquering his disgust by a train of reflections very much like that of the hunter. </s>
<s>  "'tis done. </s>
<s>  and though better it were left undone, cannot be amended. </s>
<s>  you see, we are, too obviously within the sentinels of the enemy. </s>
<s>  what course do you propose to follow?" "yes," said hawkeye, rousing himself again. </s>
<s>  "'tis as you say, too late to harbor further thoughts about it. </s>
<s>  ay, the french have gathered around the fort in good earnest and we have a delicate needle to thread in passing them. </s>
<s> " "and but little time to do it in," added heyward, glancing his eyes upwards, toward the bank of vapor that concealed the setting moon. </s>
<s>  "and little time to do it in!" repeated the scout. </s>
<s>  "the thing may be done in two fashions, by the help of providence, without which it may not be done at all. </s>
<s> " "name them quickly for time presses. </s>
<s> " "one would be to dismount the gentle ones, and let their beasts range the plain, by sending the mohicans in front, we might then cut a lane through their sentries, and enter the fort over the dead bodies. </s>
<s> " "it will not do--it will not do!" interrupted the generous heyward. </s>
<s>  "a soldier might force his way in this manner, but never with such a convoy. </s>
<s> " "'twould be, indeed, a bloody path for such tender feet to wade in," returned the equally reluctant scout. </s>
<s>  "but i thought it befitting my manhood to name it. </s>
<s>  we must, then, turn in our trail and get without the line of their lookouts, when we will bend short to the west, and enter the mountains. </s>
<s>  where i can hide you, so that all the devil's hounds in montcalm's pay would be thrown off the scent for months to come. </s>
<s> " "let it be done, and that instantly. </s>
<s> " further words were unnecessary. </s>
<s>  for hawkeye, merely uttering the mandate to "follow," moved along the route by which they had just entered their present critical and even dangerous situation. </s>
<s>  their progress, like their late dialogue, was guarded, and without noise. </s>
<s>  for none knew at what moment a passing patrol, or a crouching picket of the enemy, might rise upon their path. </s>
<s>  as they held their silent way along the margin of the pond, again heyward and the scout stole furtive glances at its appalling dreariness. </s>
<s>  they looked in vain for the form they had so recently seen stalking along in silent shores, while a low and regular wash of the little waves, by announcing that the waters were not yet subsided, furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they had just witnessed. </s>
<s>  like all that passing and gloomy scene, the low basin, however, quickly melted in the darkness, and became blended with the mass of black objects in the rear of the travelers. </s>
<s>  hawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat, and striking off towards the mountains which form the western boundary of the narrow plain, he led his followers, with swift steps, deep within the shadows that were cast from their high and broken summits. </s>
<s>  the route was now painful. </s>
<s>  lying over ground ragged with rocks, and intersected with ravines, and their progress proportionately slow. </s>
<s>  bleak and black hills lay on every side of them, compensating in some degree for the additional toil of the march by the sense of security they imparted. </s>
<s>  at length the party began slowly to rise a steep and rugged ascent, by a path that curiously wound among rocks and trees, avoiding the one and supported by the other, in a manner that showed it had been devised by men long practised in the arts of the wilderness. </s>
<s>  as they gradually rose from the level of the valleys, the thick darkness which usually precedes the approach of day began to disperse, and objects were seen in the plain and palpable colors with which they had been gifted by nature. </s>
<s>  when they issued from the stunted woods which clung to the barren sides of the mountain, upon a flat and mossy rock that formed its summit, they met the morning, as it came blushing above the green pines of a hill that lay on the opposite side of the valley of the horican. </s>
<s>  the scout now told the sisters to dismount. </s>
<s>  and taking the bridles from the mouths, and the saddles off the backs of the jaded beasts, he turned them loose, to glean a scanty subsistence among the shrubs and meager herbage of that elevated region. </s>
<s>  "go," he said, "and seek your food where natur' gives it to you. </s>
<s>  and beware that you become not food to ravenous wolves yourselves, among these hills. </s>
<s> " "have we no further need of them?" demanded heyward. </s>
<s>  "see, and judge with your own eyes," said the scout, advancing toward the eastern brow of the mountain, whither he beckoned for the whole party to follow. </s>
<s>  "if it was as easy to look into the heart of man as it is to spy out the nakedness of montcalm's camp from this spot, hypocrites would grow scarce, and the cunning of a mingo might prove a losing game, compared to the honesty of a delaware. </s>
<s> " when the travelers reached the verge of the precipices they saw, at a glance, the truth of the scout's declaration, and the admirable foresight with which he had led them to their commanding station. </s>
<s>  the mountain on which they stood, elevated perhaps a thousand feet in the air, was a high cone that rose a little in advance of that range which stretches for miles along the western shores of the lake, until meeting its sisters miles beyond the water, it ran off toward the canadas, in confused and broken masses of rock, thinly sprinkled with evergreens. </s>
<s>  immediately at the feet of the party, the southern shore of the horican swept in a broad semicircle from mountain to mountain, marking a wide str that soon rose into an uneven and somewhat elevated plain. </s>
<s>  to the north stretched the limpid,  as it appeared from that dizzy height, the narrow sheet of the "holy lake," indented with numberless bays, embellished by fantastic headlands, and dotted with countless islands. </s>
<s>  at the distance of a few leagues, the bed of the water became lost among mountains, or was wrapped in the masses of vapor that came slowly rolling along their bosom, before a light morning air. </s>
<s>  but a narrow opening between the crests of the hills pointed out the passage by which they found their way still further north, to spread their pure and ample sheets again, before pouring out their tribute into the distant champlain. </s>
<s>  to the shout stretched the defile, or rather broken plain, so often mentioned. </s>
<s>  for several miles in this direction, the mountains appeared reluctant to yield their dominion, but within reach of the eye they diverged, and finally melted into the level and sandy lands, across which we have accompanied our adventurers in their double journey. </s>
<s>  along both ranges of hills, which bounded the opposite sides of the lake and valley, clouds of light vapor were rising in spiral wreaths from the uninhabited woods, looking like the smoke of hidden cottages. </s>
<s>  or rolled lazily down the declivities, to mingle with the fogs of the lower land. </s>
<s>  a single, solitary, snow- white cloud floated above the valley, and marked the spot beneath which lay the silent pool of the "bloody pond. </s>
<s> " directly on the shore of the lake, and nearer to its western than to its eastern margin, lay the extensive earthen ramparts and low buildings of william henry. </s>
<s>  two of the sweeping bastions appeared to rest on the water which washed their bases, while a deep ditch and extensive morasses guarded its other sides and angles. </s>
<s>  the land had been cleared of wood for a reasonable distance around the work, but every other part of the scene lay in the green livery of nature, except where the limpid water mellowed the view, or the bold rocks thrust their black and naked heads above the undulating outline of the mountain ranges. </s>
<s>  in its front might be seen the scattered sentinels, who held a weary watch against their numerous foes. </s>
<s>  and within the walls themselves, the travelers looked down upon men still drowsy with a night of vigilance. </s>
<s>  toward the southeast, but in immediate contact with the fort, was an entrenched camp, posted on a rocky eminence, that would have been far more eligible for the work itself, in which hawkeye pointed out the presence of those auxiliary regiments that had so recently left the hudson in their company. </s>
<s>  from the woods, a little further to the south, rose numerous dark and lurid smokes, that were easily to be distinguished from the purer exhalations of the springs, and which the scout also showed to heyward, as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction. </s>
<s>  but the spectacle which most concerned the young soldier was on the western bank of the lake, though quite near to its southern termination. </s>
<s>  on a strip of l which appeared from his stand too narrow to contain such an army, but which, in truth, extended many hundreds of yards from the shores of the horican to the base of the mountain, were to be seen the white tents and military engines of an encampment of ten thousand men. </s>
<s>  batteries were already thrown up in their front, and even while the spectators above them were looking down, with such different emotions, on a scene which lay like a map beneath their feet, the roar of artillery rose from the valley, and passed off in thundering echoes along the eastern hills. </s>
<s>  "morning is just touching them below," said the deliberate and musing scout, "and the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by the sound of cannon. </s>
<s>  we are a few hours too late! montcalm has already filled the woods with his accursed iroquois. </s>
<s> " "the place is, indeed, invested," returned duncan. </s>
<s>  "but is there no expedient by which we may enter? capture in the works would be far preferable to falling again into the hands of roving indians. </s>
<s> " "see!" exclaimed the scout, unconsciously directing the attention of cora to the quarters of her own father, "how that shot has made the stones fly from the side of the commandant's house! ay! these frenchers will pull it to pieces faster than it was put together, solid and thick though it be!" "heyward, i sicken at the sight of danger that i cannot share," said the undaunted but anxious daughter. </s>
<s>  "let us go to montcalm, and demand admission: he dare not deny a child the boon. </s>
<s> " "you would scarce find the tent of the frenchman with the hair on your head". </s>
<s>  said the blunt scout. </s>
<s>  "if i had but one of the thousand boats which lie empty along that shore, it might be done! ha! here will soon be an end of the firing, for yonder comes a fog that will turn day to night, and make an indian arrow more dangerous than a molded cannon. </s>
<s>  now, if you are equal to the work, and will follow, i will make a push. </s>
<s>  for i long to get down into that camp, if it be only to scatter some mingo dogs that i see lurking in the skirts of yonder thicket of birch. </s>
<s> " "we are equal," said cora, firmly. </s>
<s>  "on such an errand we will follow to any danger. </s>
<s> " the scout turned to her with a smile of honest and cordial approbation, as he answered: "i would i had a thousand men, of brawny limbs and quick eyes, that feared death as little as you! i would send them jabbering frenchers back into their den again, afore the week was ended, howling like so many fettered hounds or hungry wolves. </s>
<s>   sir," he added, turning from her to the rest of the party, "the fog comes rolling down so fast, we shall have but just the time to meet it on the plain, and use it as a cover. </s>
<s>  remember, if any accident should befall me, to keep the air blowing on your left cheeks--or, rather, follow the mohicans. </s>
<s>  they'd scent their way, be it in day or be it at night. </s>
<s> " he then waved his hand for them to follow, and threw himself down the steep declivity, with free, but careful footsteps. </s>
<s>  heyward assisted the sisters to descend, and in a few minutes they were all far down a mountain whose sides they had climbed with so much toil and pain. </s>
<s>  the direction taken by hawkeye soon brought the travelers to the level of the plain, nearly opposite to a sally-port in the western curtain of the fort, which lay itself at the distance of about half a mile from the point where he halted to allow duncan to come up with his charge. </s>
<s>  in their eagerness, and favored by the nature of the ground, they had anticipated the fog, which was rolling heavily down the lake, and it became necessary to pause, until the mists had wrapped the camp of the enemy in their fleecy mantle. </s>
<s>  the mohicans profited by the delay, to steal out of the woods, and to make a survey of surrounding objects. </s>
<s>  they were followed at a little distance by the scout, with a view to profit early by their report, and to obtain some faint knowledge for himself of the more immediate localities. </s>
<s>  in a very few moments he returned, his face reddened with vexation, while he muttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import. </s>
<s>  "here has the cunning frenchman been posting a picket directly in our path," he said. </s>
<s>  "red-skins and whites. </s>
<s>  and we shall be as likely to fall into their midst as to pass them in the fog!" "cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger," asked heyward, "and come into our path again when it is passed?" "who that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when or how to find it again! the mists of horican are not like the curls from a peace-pipe, or the smoke which settles above a mosquito fire. </s>
<s> " he was yet speaking, when a crashing sound was heard, and a cannon-ball entered the thicket, striking the body of a sapling, and rebounding to the earth, its force being much expended by previous resistance. </s>
<s>  the indians followed instantly like busy attendants on the terrible messenger, and uncas commenced speaking earnestly and with much action, in the delaware tongue. </s>
<s>  "it may be so, lad," muttered the scout, when he had ended. </s>
<s>  "for desperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache. </s>
<s>  come, then, the fog is shutting in. </s>
<s> " "stop!" cried heyward. </s>
<s>  "first explain your expectations. </s>
<s> " "'tis soon done, and a small hope it is. </s>
<s>  but it is better than nothing. </s>
<s>  this shot that you see," added the scout, kicking the harmless iron with his foot, "has plowed the 'arth in its road from the fort, and we shall hunt for the furrow it has made, when all other signs may fail. </s>
<s>  no more words, but follow, or the fog may leave us in the middle of our path, a mark for both armies to shoot at. </s>
<s> " heyward perceiving that, in fact, a crisis had arrived, when acts were more required than words, placed himself between the sisters, and drew them swiftly forward, keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye. </s>
<s>  it was soon apparent that hawkeye had not magnified the power of the fog, for before they had proceeded twenty yards, it was difficult for the different individuals of the party to distinguish each other in the vapor. </s>
<s>  they had made their little circuit to the left, and were already inclining again toward the right, having, as heyward thought, got over nearly half the distance to the friendly works, when his ears were saluted with the fierce summons, apparently within twenty feet of them, of: "qui va la?" "push on!" whispered the scout, once more bending to the left. </s>
<s>  "push on!" repeated heyward. </s>
<s>  when the summons was renewed by a dozen voices, each of which seemed charged with menace. </s>
<s>  "c'est moi," cried duncan, dragging rather than leading those he supported swiftly onward. </s>
<s>  "bete!--qui?--moi!" "ami de la france. </s>
<s> " "tu m'as plus l'air d'un ennemi de la france. </s>
<s>  arrete ou pardieu je te ferai ami du diable. </s>
<s>  non! feu, camarades, feu!" the order was instantly obeyed, and the fog was stirred by the explosion of fifty muskets. </s>
<s>  happily, the aim was bad, and the bullets cut the air in a direction a little different from that taken by the fugitives. </s>
<s>  though still so nigh them, that to the unpractised ears of david and the two females, it appeared as if they whistled within a few inches of the organs. </s>
<s>  the outcry was renewed, and the order, not only to fire again, but to pursue, was too plainly audible. </s>
<s>  when heyward briefly explained the meaning of the words they heard, hawkeye halted and spoke with quick decision and great firmness. </s>
<s>  "let us deliver our fire," he said. </s>
<s>  "they will believe it a sortie, and give way, or they will wait for reinforcements. </s>
<s> " the scheme was well conceived, but failed in its effects. </s>
<s>  the instant the french heard the pieces, it seemed as if the plain was alive with men, muskets rattling along its whole extent, from the shores of the lake to the furthest boundary of the woods. </s>
<s>  "we shall draw their entire army upon us, and bring on a general assault," said duncan: "lead on, my friend, for your own life and ours. </s>
<s> " the scout seemed willing to comply. </s>
<s>   in the hurry of the moment, and in the change of position, he had lost the direction. </s>
<s>  in vain he turned either cheek toward the light air. </s>
<s>  they felt equally cool. </s>
<s>  in this dilemma, uncas lighted on the furrow of the cannon ball, where it had cut the ground in three adjacent ant-hills. </s>
<s>  "give me the range!" said hawkeye, bending to catch a glimpse of the direction, and then instantly moving onward. </s>
<s>  cries, oaths, voices calling to each other, and the reports of muskets, were now quick and incessant,  apparently, on every side of them. </s>
<s>  suddenly a strong glare of light flashed across the scene, the fog rolled upward in thick wreaths, and several cannons belched across the plain, and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bellowing echoes of the mountain. </s>
<s>  "'tis from the fort!" exclaimed hawkeye, turning short on his tracks. </s>
<s>  "and we, like stricken fools, were rushing to the woods, under the very knives of the maquas. </s>
<s> " the instant their mistake was rectified, the whole party retraced the error with the utmost diligence. </s>
<s>  duncan willingly relinquished the support of cora to the arm of uncas and cora as readily accepted the welcome assistance. </s>
<s>  men, hot and angry in pursuit, were evidently on their footsteps, and each instant threatened their capture, if not their destruction. </s>
<s>  "point de quartier aux coquins!" cried an eager pursuer, who seemed to direct the operations of the enemy. </s>
<s>  "stand firm, and be ready, my gallant sixtieths!" suddenly exclaimed a voice above them. </s>
<s>  "wait to see the enemy, fire low and sweep the glacis. </s>
<s> " "father! father!" exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist: "it is i! alice! thy own elsie! spare, oh! save your daughters!" "hold!" shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of parental agony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and rolling back in solemn echo. </s>
<s>  "'tis she! god has restored me to my children! throw open the sally-port. </s>
<s>  to the field, sixtieths, to the field. </s>
<s>  pull not a trigger, lest ye kill my lambs! drive off these dogs of france with your steel. </s>
<s> " duncan heard the grating of the rusty hinges, and darting to the spot, directed by the sound, he met a long line of dark red warriors, passing swiftly toward the glacis. </s>
<s>  he knew them for his own battalion of the royal americans, and flying to their head, soon swept every trace of his pursuers from before the works. </s>
<s>  for an instant, cora and alice had stood trembling and bewildered by this unexpected desertion. </s>
<s>  but before either had leisure for speech, or even thought, an officer of gigantic frame, whose locks were bleached with years and service, but whose air of military grandeur had been rather softened than destroyed by time, rushed out of the body of mist, and folded them to his bosom, while large scalding tears rolled down his pale and wrinkled cheeks, and he exclaimed, in the peculiar accent of scotland: "for this i thank thee, lord! let danger come as it will, thy servant is now prepared!" chapter 15 "then go we in, to know his embassy. </s>
<s>  which i could, with ready guess, declare, before the frenchmen speak a word of it,"--king henry v a few succeeding days were passed amid the privations, the uproar, and the dangers of the siege, which was vigorously pressed by a power, against whose approaches munro possessed no competent means of resistance. </s>
<s>  it appeared as if webb, with his army, which lay slumbering on the banks of the hudson, had utterly forgotten the strait to which his countrymen were reduced. </s>
<s>  montcalm had filled the woods of the portage with his savages, every yell and whoop from whom rang through the british encampment, chilling the hearts of men who were already but too much disposed to magnify the danger. </s>
<s>  not so, however, with the besieged. </s>
<s>  animated by the words, and stimulated by the examples of their leaders, they had found their courage, and maintained their ancient reputation, with a zeal that did justice to the stern character of their commander. </s>
<s>  as if satisfied with the toil of marching through the wilderness to encounter his enemy, the french general, though of approved skill, had neglected to seize the adjacent mountains. </s>
<s>  whence the besieged might have been exterminated with impunity, and which, in the more modern warfare of the country, would not have been neglected for a single hour. </s>
<s>  this sort of contempt for eminences, or rather dread of the labor of ascending them, might have been termed the besetting weakness of the warfare of the period. </s>
<s>  it originated in the simplicity of the indian contests, in which, from the nature of the combats, and the density of the forests, fortresses were rare, and artillery next to useless. </s>
<s>  the carelessness engendered by these usages descended even to the war of the revolution and lost the states the important fortress of ticonderoga opening a way for the army of burgoyne into what was then the bosom of the country. </s>
<s>  we look back at this ignorance, or infatuation, whichever it may be called, with wonder, knowing that the neglect of an eminence, whose difficulties, like those of mount defiance, have been so greatly exaggerated, would, at the present time, prove fatal to the reputation of the engineer who had planned the works at their base, or to that of the general whose lot it was to defend them. </s>
<s>  the tourist, the valetudinarian, or the amateur of the beauties of nature, who, in the train of his four-in-h now rolls through the scenes we have attempted to describe, in quest of information, health, or pleasure, or floats steadily toward his object on those artificial waters which have sprung up under the administration of a statesman who has dared to stake his political character on the hazardous issue, is not to suppose that his ancestors traversed those hills, or struggled with the same currents with equal facility. </s>
<s>  the transportation of a single heavy gun was often considered equal to a victory gained. </s>

<s>   evidently the late de witt clinton, who died governor of new york in 1828. </s>
<s>  the evils of this state of things pressed heavily on the fortunes of the resolute scotsman who now defended william henry. </s>
<s>  though his adversary neglected the hills, he had planted his batteries with judgment on the plain, and caused them to be served with vigor and skill. </s>
<s>  against this assault, the besieged could only oppose the imperfect and hasty preparations of a fortress in the wilderness. </s>
<s>  it was in the afternoon of the fifth day of the siege, and the fourth of his own service in it, that major heyward profited by a parley that had just been beaten, by repairing to the ramparts of one of the water bastions, to breathe the cool air from the lake, and to take a survey of the progress of the siege. </s>
<s>  he was alone, if the solitary sentinel who paced the mound be excepted. </s>
<s>  for the artillerists had hastened also to profit by the temporary suspension of their arduous duties. </s>
<s>  the evening was delightfully calm, and the light air from the limpid water fresh and soothing. </s>
<s>  it seemed as if, with the termination of the roar of artillery and the plunging of shot, nature had also seized the moment to assume her mildest and most captivating form. </s>
<s>  the sun poured down his parting glory on the scene, without the oppression of those fierce rays that belong to the climate and the season. </s>
<s>  the mountains looked green, and fresh, and lovely, tempered with the milder light, or softened in shadow, as thin vapors floated between them and the sun. </s>
<s>  the numerous islands rested on the bosom of the horican, some low and sunken, as if embedded in the waters, and others appearing to hover about the element, in little hillocks of green velvet. </s>
<s>  among which the fishermen of the beleaguering army peacefully rowed their skiffs, or floated at rest on the glassy mirror in quiet pursuit of their employment. </s>
<s>  the scene was at once animated and still. </s>
<s>  all that pertained to nature was sweet, or simply grand. </s>
<s>  while those parts which depended on the temper and movements of man were lively and playful. </s>
<s>  two little spotless flags were abroad, the one on a salient angle of the fort, and the other on the advanced battery of the besiegers. </s>

<s>  behind these again swung, heavily opening and closing in silken folds, the rival standards of england and france. </s>
<s>  a hundred gay and thoughtless young frenchmen were drawing a net to the pebbly beach, within dangerous proximity to the sullen but silent cannon of the fort, while the eastern mountain was sending back the loud shouts and gay merriment that attended their sport. </s>
<s>  some were rushing eagerly to enjoy the aquatic games of the lake, and others were already toiling their way up the neighboring hills, with the restless curiosity of their nation. </s>
<s>  to all these sports and pursuits, those of the enemy who watched the besieged, and the besieged themselves, were, however, merely the idle though sympathizing spectators. </s>
<s>  here and there a picket had, indeed, raised a song, or mingled in a dance, which had drawn the dusky savages around them, from their lairs in the forest. </s>
<s>  in short, everything wore rather the appearance of a day of pleasure, than of an hour stolen from the dangers and toil of a bloody and vindictive warfare. </s>
<s>  duncan had stood in a musing attitude, contemplating this scene a few minutes, when his eyes were directed to the glacis in front of the sally-port already mentioned, by the sounds of approaching footsteps. </s>
<s>  he walked to an angle of the bastion, and beheld the scout advancing, under the custody of a french officer, to the body of the fort. </s>
<s>  the countenance of hawkeye was haggard and careworn, and his air dejected, as though he felt the deepest degradation at having fallen into the power of his enemies. </s>
<s>  he was without his favorite weapon, and his arms were even bound behind him with thongs, made of the skin of a deer. </s>
<s>  the arrival of flags to cover the messengers of summons, had occurred so often of late, that when heyward first threw his careless glance on this group, he expected to see another of the officers of the enemy, charged with a similar office but the instant he recognized the tall person and still sturdy though downcast features of his friend, the woodsman, he started with surprise, and turned to descend from the bastion into the bosom of the work. </s>
<s>  the sounds of other voices, however, caught his attention, and for a moment caused him to forget his purpose. </s>
<s>  at the inner angle of the mound he met the sisters, walking along the parapet, in search, like himself, of air and relief from confinement. </s>
<s>  they had not met from that painful moment when he deserted them on the plain, only to assure their safety. </s>
<s>  he had parted from them worn with care, and jaded with fatigue. </s>
<s>  he now saw them refreshed and blooming, though timid and anxious. </s>
<s>  under such an inducement it will cause no surprise that the young man lost sight for a time, of other objects in order to address them. </s>
<s>  he was, however, anticipated by the voice of the ingenuous and youthful alice. </s>
<s>  "ah! thou tyrant! thou recreant knight! he who abandons his damsels in the very lists," she cried. </s>
<s>  "here have we been days, nay, ages, expecting you at our feet, imploring mercy and forgetfulness of your craven backsliding, or i should rather say, backrunning--for verily you fled in the manner that no stricken deer, as our worthy friend the scout would say, could equal!" "you know that alice means our thanks and our blessings," added the graver and more thoughtful cora. </s>
<s>  "in truth, we have a little wonder why you should so rigidly absent yourself from a place where the gratitude of the daughters might receive the support of a parent's thanks. </s>
<s> " "your father himself could tell you, that, though absent from your presence, i have not been altogether forgetful of your safety," returned the young man. </s>
<s>  "the mastery of yonder village of huts," pointing to the neighboring entrenched camp, "has been keenly disputed. </s>
<s>  and he who holds it is sure to be possessed of this fort, and that which it contains. </s>
<s>  my days and nights have all been passed there since we separated, because i thought that duty called me thither. </s>
<s>  " he added, with an air of chagrin, which he endeavored, though unsuccessfully, to conceal, "had i been aware that what i then believed a soldier's conduct could be so construed, shame would have been added to the list of reasons. </s>
<s> " "heyward! duncan!" exclaimed alice, bending forward to read his half-averted countenance, until a lock of her golden hair rested on her flushed cheek, and nearly concealed the tear that had started to her eye. </s>
<s>  "did i think this idle tongue of mine had pained you, i would silence it forever. </s>
<s>  cora can say, if cora would, how justly we have prized your services, and how deep--i had almost said, how fervent-- is our gratitude. </s>
<s> " "and will cora attest the truth of this?" cried duncan, suffering the cloud to be chased from his countenance by a smile of open pleasure. </s>
<s>  "what says our graver sister? will she find an excuse for the neglect of the knight in the duty of a soldier?" cora made no immediate answer, but turned her face toward the water, as if looking on the sheet of the horican. </s>
<s>  when she did bend her dark eyes on the young man, they were yet filled with an expression of anguish that at once drove every thought but that of kind solicitude from his mind. </s>
<s>  "you are not well, dearest miss munro!" he exclaimed. </s>
<s>  "we have trifled while you are in suffering!" "'tis nothing," she answered, refusing his support with feminine reserve. </s>
<s>  "that i cannot see the sunny side of the picture of life, like this artless but ardent enthusiast," she added, laying her hand lightly, but affectionately, on the arm of her sister, "is the penalty of experience,  perhaps, the misfortune of my nature. </s>
<s>  see," she continued, as if determined to shake off infirmity, in a sense of duty. </s>
<s>  "look around you, major heyward, and tell me what a prospect is this for the daughter of a soldier whose greatest happiness is his honor and his military renown. </s>
<s> " "neither ought nor shall be tarnished by circumstances over which he has had no control," duncan warmly replied. </s>
<s>  "but your words recall me to my own duty. </s>
<s>  i go now to your gallant father, to hear his determination in matters of the last moment to the defense. </s>
<s>  god bless you in every fortune, noble--cora--i may and must call you. </s>
<s> " she frankly gave him her h though her lip quivered, and her cheeks gradually became of ashly paleness. </s>
<s>  "in every fortune, i know you will be an ornament and honor to your sex. </s>
<s>  alice, adieu"--his voice changed from admiration to tenderness-- "adieu, alice. </s>
<s>  we shall soon meet again. </s>
<s>  as conquerors, i trust, and amid rejoicings!" without waiting for an answer from either, the young man threw himself down the grassy steps of the bastion, and moving rapidly across the parade, he was quickly in the presence of their father. </s>
<s>  munro was pacing his narrow apartment with a disturbed air and gigantic strides as duncan entered. </s>
<s>  "you have anticipated my wishes, major heyward," he said. </s>
<s>  "i was about to request this favor. </s>
<s> " "i am sorry to see, sir, that the messenger i so warmly recommended has returned in custody of the french! i hope there is no reason to distrust his fidelity?" "the fidelity of 'the long rifle' is well known to me," returned munro, "and is above suspicion. </s>
<s>  though his usual good fortune seems, at last, to have failed. </s>
<s>  montcalm has got him, and with the accursed politeness of his nation, he has sent him in with a doleful tale, of 'knowing how i valued the fellow, he could not think of retaining him' a jesuitical way that, major duncan heyward, of telling a man of his misfortunes!" "but the general and his succor?" "did ye look to the south as ye entered, and could ye not see them?" said the old soldier, laughing bitterly. </s>
<s>  "hoot! hoot! you're an impatient boy, sir, and cannot give the gentlemen leisure for their march!" "they are coming, then? the scout has said as much?" "when? and by what path? for the dunce has omitted to tell me this. </s>
<s>  there is a letter, it would seem, too. </s>
<s>  and that is the only agreeable part of the matter. </s>
<s>  for the customary attentions of your marquis of montcalm--i warrant me, duncan, that he of lothian would buy a dozen such marquisates--but if the news of the letter were bad, the gentility of this french monsieur would certainly compel him to let us know it. </s>
<s> " "he keeps the letter, then, while he releases the messenger?" "ay, that does he, and all for the sake of what you call your 'bonhommie' i would venture, if the truth was known, the fellow's grandfather taught the noble science of dancing. </s>
<s> " "but what says the scout? he has eyes and ears, and a tongue. </s>
<s>  what verbal report does he make?" "oh! sir, he is not wanting in natural organs, and he is free to tell all that he has seen and heard. </s>
<s>  the whole amount is this. </s>
<s>  there is a fort of his majesty's on the banks of the hudson, called edward, in honor of his gracious highness of york, you'll know. </s>
<s>  and it is well filled with armed men, as such a work should be. </s>
<s> " "but was there no movement, no signs of any intention to advance to our relief?" "there were the morning and evening parades. </s>
<s>  and when one of the provincial loons--you'll know, dunca, you're half a scotsman yourself--when one of them dropped his powder over his porretch, if it touched the coals, it just burned!" then, suddenly changing his bitter, ironical manner, to one more grave and thoughtful, he continued: "and yet there might, and must be, something in that letter which it would be well to know!" "our decision should be speedy," said duncan, gladly availing himself of this change of humor, to press the more important objects of their interview. </s>
<s>  "i cannot conceal from you, sir, that the camp will not be much longer tenable. </s>
<s>  and i am sorry to add, that things appear no better in the fort. </s>
<s>  more than half the guns are bursted. </s>
<s> " "and how should it be otherwise? some were fished from the bottom of the lake. </s>
<s>  some have been rusting in woods since the discovery of the country. </s>
<s>  and some were never guns at all--mere privateersmen's playthings! do you think, sir, you can have woolwich warren in the midst of a wilderness, three thousand miles from great britain?" "the walls are crumbling about our ears, and provisions begin to fail us," continued heyward, without regarding the new burst of indignation. </s>
<s>  "even the men show signs of discontent and alarm. </s>
<s> " "major heyward," said munro, turning to his youthful associate with the dignity of his years and superior rank. </s>
<s>  "i should have served his majesty for half a century, and earned these gray hairs in vain, were i ignorant of all you say, and of the pressing nature of our circumstances. </s>
<s>  still, there is everything due to the honor of the king's arms, and something to ourselves. </s>
<s>  while there is hope of succor, this fortress will i defend, though it be to be done with pebbles gathered on the lake shore. </s>
<s>  it is a sight of the letter, therefore, that we want, that we may know the intentions of the man the earl of loudon has left among us as his substitute. </s>
<s> " "and can i be of service in the matter?" "sir, you can. </s>
<s>  the marquis of montcalm has, in addition to his other civilities, invited me to a personal interview between the works and his own camp. </s>
<s>  in order, as he says, to impart some additional information. </s>
<s>  now, i think it would not be wise to show any undue solicitude to meet him, and i would employ you, an officer of rank, as my substitute. </s>
<s>  for it would but ill comport with the honor of scotland to let it be said one of her gentlemen was outdone in civility by a native of any other country on earth. </s>
<s> " without assuming the supererogatory task of entering into a discussion of the comparative merits of national courtesy, duncan cheerfully assented to supply the place of the veteran in the approaching interview. </s>
<s>  a long and confidential communication now succeeded, during which the young man received some additional insight into his duty, from the experience and native acuteness of his commander, and then the former took his leave. </s>
<s>  as duncan could only act as the representative of the commandant of the fort, the ceremonies which should have accompanied a meeting between the heads of the adverse forces were, of course, dispensed with. </s>
<s>  the truce still existed, and with a roll and beat of the drum, and covered by a little white flag, duncan left the sally-port, within ten minutes after his instructions were ended. </s>
<s>  he was received by the french officer in advance with the usual formalities, and immediately accompanied to a distant marquee of the renowned soldier who led the forces of france. </s>
<s>  the general of the enemy received the youthful messenger, surrounded by his principal officers, and by a swarthy band of the native chiefs, who had followed him to the field, with the warriors of their several tribes. </s>
<s>  heyward paused short, when, in glancing his eyes rapidly over the dark group of the latter, he beheld the malignant countenance of magua, regarding him with the calm but sullen attention which marked the expression of that subtle savage. </s>
<s>  a slight exclamation of surprise even burst from the lips of the young man, but instantly, recollecting his err and the presence in which he stood, he suppressed every appearance of emotion, and turned to the hostile leader, who had already advanced a step to receive him. </s>
<s>  the marquis of montcalm was, at the period of which we write, in the flower of his age,  it may be added, in the zenith of his fortunes. </s>
<s>  but even in that enviable situation, he was affable, and distinguished as much for his attention to the forms of courtesy, as for that chivalrous courage which, only two short years afterward, induced him to throw away his life on the plains of abraham. </s>
<s>  duncan, in turning his eyes from the malign expression of magua, suffered them to rest with pleasure on the smiling and polished features, and the noble military air, of the french general. </s>
<s>  "monsieur," said the latter, "j'ai beaucoup de plaisir a-- bah!--ou est cet interprete?" "je crois, monsieur, qu'il ne sear pas necessaire," heyward modestly replied. </s>
<s>  "je parle un peu fran‡ais. </s>
<s> " "ah! j'en suis bien aise," said montcalm, taking duncan familiarly by the arm, and leading him deep into the marquee, a little out of earshot. </s>
<s>  "je deteste ces fripons- la. </s>
<s>  on ne sait jamais sur quel pie on est avec eux. </s>
<s>  eh, bien! monsieur," he continued still speaking in french. </s>
<s>  "though i should have been proud of receiving your commandant, i am very happy that he has seen proper to employ an officer so distinguished, and who, i am sure, is so amiable, as yourself. </s>
<s> " duncan bowed low, pleased with the compliment, in spite of a most heroic determination to suffer no artifice to allure him into forgetfulness of the interest of his prince. </s>
<s>  and montcalm, after a pause of a moment, as if to collect his thoughts, proceeded: "your commandant is a brave man, and well qualified to repel my assault. </s>
<s>  mais, monsieur, is it not time to begin to take more counsel of humanity, and less of your courage? the one as strongly characterizes the hero as the other. </s>
<s> " "we consider the qualities as inseparable," returned duncan, smiling. </s>
<s>  "but while we find in the vigor of your excellency every motive to stimulate the one, we can, as yet, see no particular call for the exercise of the other. </s>
<s> " montcalm, in his turn, slightly bowed, but it was with the air of a man too practised to remember the language of flattery. </s>
<s>  after musing a moment, he added: "it is possible my glasses have deceived me, and that your works resist our cannon better than i had supposed. </s>
<s>  you know our force?" "our accounts vary," said duncan, carelessly. </s>
<s>  "the highest, however, has not exceeded twenty thousand men. </s>
<s> " the frenchman bit his lip, and fastened his eyes keenly on the other as if to read his thoughts. </s>
<s>  then, with a readiness peculiar to himself, he continued, as if assenting to the truth of an enumeration which quite doubled his army: "it is a poor compliment to the vigilance of us soldiers, monsieur, that, do what we will, we never can conceal our numbers. </s>
<s>  if it were to be done at all, one would believe it might succeed in these woods. </s>
<s>  though you think it too soon to listen to the calls of humanity," he added, smiling archly, "i may be permitted to believe that gallantry is not forgotten by one so young as yourself. </s>
<s>  the daughters of the commandant, i learn, have passed into the fort since it was invested?" "it is true, monsieur. </s>
<s>   so far from weakening our efforts, they set us an example of courage in their own fortitude. </s>
<s>  were nothing but resolution necessary to repel so accomplished a soldier as m. </s>
<s>  de montcalm, i would gladly trust the defense of william henry to the elder of those ladies. </s>
<s> " "we have a wise ordinance in our salique laws, which says, 'the crown of france shall never degrade the lance to the distaff'," said montcalm, dryly, and with a little hauteur. </s>
<s>  but instantly adding, with his former frank and easy air: "as all the nobler qualities are hereditary, i can easily credit you. </s>
<s>  though, as i said before, courage has its limits, and humanity must not be forgotten. </s>
<s>  i trust, monsieur, you come authorized to treat for the surrender of the place?" "has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the measure necessary?" "i should be sorry to have the defense protracted in such a manner as to irritate my red friends there," continued montcalm, glancing his eyes at the group of grave and attentive indians, without attending to the other's questions. </s>
<s>  "i find it difficult, even now, to limit them to the usages of war. </s>
<s> " heyward was silent. </s>
<s>  for a painful recollection of the dangers he had so recently escaped came over his mind, and recalled the images of those defenseless beings who had shared in all his sufferings. </s>
<s>  "ces messieurs-la," said montcalm, following up the advantage which he conceived he had gained, "are most formidable when baffled. </s>
<s>  and it is unnecessary to tell you with what difficulty they are restrained in their anger. </s>
<s>  eh bien, monsieur! shall we speak of the terms?" "i fear your excellency has been deceived as to the strength of william henry, and the resources of its garrison!" "i have not sat down before quebec, but an earthen work, that is defended by twenty-three hundred gallant men," was the laconic reply. </s>
<s>  "our mounds are earthen, certainly--nor are they seated on the rocks of cape diamond. </s>
<s>  but they stand on that shore which proved so destructive to dieskau and his army. </s>
<s>  there is also a powerful force within a few hours' march of us, which we account upon as a part of our means. </s>
<s> " "some six or eight thousand men," returned montcalm, with much apparent indifference, "whom their leader wisely judges to be safer in their works than in the field. </s>
<s> " it was now heyward's turn to bite his lip with vexation as the other so coolly alluded to a force which the young man knew to be overrated. </s>
<s>  both mused a little while in silence, when montcalm renewed the conversation, in a way that showed he believed the visit of his guest was solely to propose terms of capitulation. </s>
<s>  on the other h heyward began to throw sundry inducements in the way of the french general, to betray the discoveries he had made through the intercepted letter. </s>
<s>  the artifice of neither, however, succeeded. </s>
<s>  and after a protracted and fruitless interview, duncan took his leave, favorably impressed with an opinion of the courtesy and talents of the enemy's captain, but as ignorant of what he came to learn as when he arrived. </s>
<s>  montcalm followed him as far as the entrance of the marquee, renewing his invitations to the commandant of the fort to give him an immediate meeting in the open ground between the two armies. </s>
<s>  there they separated, and duncan returned to the advanced post of the french, accompanied as before. </s>
<s>  whence he instantly proceeded to the fort, and to the quarters of his own commander. </s>

<s>  alice sat upon his knee, parting the gray hairs on the forehead of the old man with her delicate fingers. </s>
<s>  and whenever he affected to frown on her trifling, appeasing his assumed anger by pressing her ruby lips fondly on his wrinkled brow. </s>
<s>  cora was seated nigh them, a calm and amused looker-on. </s>
<s>  regarding the wayward movements of her more youthful sister with that species of maternal fondness which characterized her love for alice. </s>
<s>  not only the dangers through which they had passed, but those which still impended above them, appeared to be momentarily forgotten, in the soothing indulgence of such a family meeting. </s>
<s>  it seemed as if they had profited by the short truce, to devote an instant to the purest and best affection. </s>
<s>  the daughters forgetting their fears, and the veteran his cares, in the security of the moment. </s>
<s>  of this scene, duncan, who, in his eagerness to report his arrival, had entered unannounced, stood many moments an unobserved and a delighted spectator. </s>
<s>  but the quick and dancing eyes of alice soon caught a glimpse of his figure reflected from a glass, and she sprang blushing from her father's knee, exclaiming aloud: "major heyward!" "what of the lad?" demanded her father. </s>
<s>  "i have sent him to crack a little with the frenchman. </s>
<s>  ha, sir, you are young, and you're nimble! away with you, ye baggage. </s>
<s>  as if there were not troubles enough for a soldier, without having his camp filled with such prattling hussies as yourself!" alice laughingly followed her sister, who instantly led the way from an apartment where she perceived their presence was no longer desirable. </s>
<s>  munro, instead of demanding the result of the young man's mission, paced the room for a few moments, with his hands behind his back, and his head inclined toward the floor, like a man lost in thought. </s>
<s>  at length he raised his eyes, glistening with a father's fondness, and exclaimed: "they are a pair of excellent girls, heyward, and such as any one may boast of. </s>
<s> " "you are not now to learn my opinion of your daughters, colonel munro. </s>
<s> " "true, lad, true," interrupted the impatient old man. </s>
<s>  "you were about opening your mind more fully on that matter the day you got in, but i did not think it becoming in an old soldier to be talking of nuptial blessings and wedding jokes when the enemies of his king were likely to be unbidden guests at the feast. </s>
<s>  but i was wrong, duncan, boy, i was wrong there. </s>
<s>  and i am now ready to hear what you have to say. </s>
<s> " "notwithstanding the pleasure your assurance gives me, dear sir, i have just now, a message from montcalm--" "let the frenchman and all his host go to the devil, sir!" exclaimed the hasty veteran. </s>
<s>  "he is not yet master of william henry, nor shall he ever be, provided webb proves himself the man he should. </s>
<s>  no, sir, thank heaven we are not yet in such a strait that it can be said munro is too much pressed to discharge the little domestic duties of his own family. </s>
<s>  your mother was the only child of my bosom friend, duncan. </s>
<s>  and i'll just give you a hearing, though all the knights of st. </s>

<s>  the thistle is the order for dignity and antiquity. </s>
<s>  the veritable 'nemo me impune lacessit' of chivalry. </s>
<s>  ye had ancestors in that degree, duncan, and they were an ornament to the nobles of scotland. </s>
<s> " heyward, who perceived that his superior took a malicious pleasure in exhibiting his contempt for the message of the french general, was fain to humor a spleen that he knew would be short-lived. </s>
<s>  he therefore, replied with as much indifference as he could assume on such a subject: "my request, as you know, sir, went so far as to presume to the honor of being your son. </s>
<s> " "ay, boy, you found words to make yourself very plainly comprehended. </s>
<s>   let me ask ye, sir, have you been as intelligible to the girl?" "on my honor, no," exclaimed duncan, warmly. </s>
<s>  "there would have been an abuse of a confided trust, had i taken advantage of my situation for such a purpose. </s>
<s> " "your notions are those of a gentleman, major heyward, and well enough in their place. </s>
<s>  but cora munro is a maiden too discreet, and of a mind too elevated and improved, to need the guardianship even of a father. </s>
<s> " "cora!" "ay--cora! we are talking of your pretensions to miss munro, are we not, sir?" "i--i--i was not conscious of having mentioned her name," said duncan, stammering. </s>
<s>  "and to marry whom, then, did you wish my consent, major heyward?" demanded the old soldier, erecting himself in the dignity of offended feeling. </s>
<s>  "you have another, and not less lovely child. </s>
<s> " "alice!" exclaimed the father, in an astonishment equal to that with which duncan had just repeated the name of her sister. </s>
<s>  "such was the direction of my wishes, sir. </s>
<s> " the young man awaited in silence the result of the extraordinary effect produced by a communication, which, as it now appeared, was so unexpected. </s>
<s>  for several minutes munro paced the chamber with long and rapid strides, his rigid features working convulsively, and every faculty seemingly absorbed in the musings of his own mind. </s>
<s>  at length, he paused directly in front of heyward, and riveting his eyes upon those of the other, he said, with a lip that quivered violently: "duncan heyward, i have loved you for the sake of him whose blood is in your veins. </s>
<s>  i have loved you for your own good qualities. </s>
<s>  and i have loved you, because i thought you would contribute to the happiness of my child. </s>
<s>  but all this love would turn to hatred, were i assured that what i so much apprehend is true. </s>
<s> " "god forbid that any act or thought of mine should lead to such a change!" exclaimed the young man, whose eye never quailed under the penetrating look it encountered. </s>
<s>  without adverting to the impossibility of the other's comprehending those feelings which were hid in his own bosom, munro suffered himself to be appeased by the unaltered countenance he met, and with a voice sensibly softened, he continued: "you would be my son, duncan, and you're ignorant of the history of the man you wish to call your father. </s>
<s>  sit ye down, young man, and i will open to you the wounds of a seared heart, in as few words as may be suitable. </s>
<s> " by this time, the message of montcalm was as much forgotten by him who bore it as by the man for whose ears it was intended. </s>
<s>  each drew a chair, and while the veteran communed a few moments with his own thoughts, apparently in sadness, the youth suppressed his impatience in a look and attitude of respectful attention. </s>
<s>  at length, the former spoke: "you'll know, already, major heyward, that my family was both ancient and honorable," commenced the scotsman. </s>
<s>  "though it might not altogether be endowed with that amount of wealth that should correspond with its degree. </s>
<s>  i was, maybe, such an one as yourself when i plighted my faith to alice graham, the only child of a neighboring laird of some estate. </s>
<s>  but the connection was disagreeable to her father, on more accounts than my poverty. </s>
<s>  i did, therefore, what an honest man should--restored the maiden her troth, and departed the country in the service of my king. </s>
<s>  i had seen many regions, and had shed much blood in different lands, before duty called me to the islands of the west indies. </s>
<s>  there it was my lot to form a connection with one who in time became my wife, and the mother of cora. </s>
<s>  she was the daughter of a gentleman of those isles, by a lady whose misfortune it was, if you will," said the old man, proudly, "to be descended, remotely, from that unfortunate class who are so basely enslaved to administer to the wants of a luxurious people. </s>
<s>  ay, sir, that is a curse, entailed on scotland by her unnatural union with a foreign and trading people. </s>
<s>  but could i find a man among them who would dare to reflect on my child, he should feel the weight of a father's anger! ha! major heyward, you are yourself born at the south, where these unfortunate beings are considered of a race inferior to your own. </s>
<s> " "'tis most unfortunately true, sir," said duncan, unable any longer to prevent his eyes from sinking to the floor in embarrassment. </s>
<s>  "and you cast it on my child as a reproach! you scorn to mingle the blood of the heywards with one so degraded-- lovely and virtuous though she be?" fiercely demanded the jealous parent. </s>
<s>  "heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason!" returned duncan, at the same time conscious of such a feeling, and that as deeply rooted as if it had been ingrafted in his nature. </s>
<s>  "the sweetness, the beauty, the witchery of your younger daughter, colonel munro, might explain my motives without imputing to me this injustice. </s>
<s> " "ye are right, sir," returned the old man, again changing his tones to those of gentleness, or rather softness. </s>
<s>  "the girl is the image of what her mother was at her years, and before she had become acquainted with grief. </s>
<s>  when death deprived me of my wife i returned to scotl enriched by the marriage. </s>
<s>   would you think it, duncan! the suffering angel had remained in the heartless state of celibacy twenty long years, and that for the sake of a man who could forget her! she did more, sir. </s>
<s>  she overlooked my want of faith,  all difficulties being now removed, she took me for her husband. </s>
<s> " "and became the mother of alice?" exclaimed duncan, with an eagerness that might have proved dangerous at a moment when the thoughts of munro were less occupied that at present. </s>
<s>  "she did, indeed," said the old man, "and dearly did she pay for the blessing she bestowed. </s>
<s>  but she is a saint in heaven, sir. </s>
<s>  and it ill becomes one whose foot rests on the grave to mourn a lot so blessed. </s>
<s>  i had her but a single year, though. </s>
<s>  a short term of happiness for one who had seen her youth fade in hopeless pining. </s>
<s> " there was something so commanding in the distress of the old man, that heyward did not dare to venture a syllable of consolation. </s>
<s>  munro sat utterly unconscious of the other's presence, his features exposed and working with the anguish of his regrets, while heavy tears fell from his eyes, and rolled unheeded from his cheeks to the floor. </s>
<s>  at length he moved, and as if suddenly recovering his recollection. </s>
<s>  when he arose, and taking a single turn across the room, he approached his companion with an air of military grandeur, and demanded: "have you not, major heyward, some communication that i should hear from the marquis de montcalm?" duncan started in his turn, and immediately commenced in an embarrassed voice, the half-forgotten message. </s>
<s>  it is unnecessary to dwell upon the evasive though polite manner with which the french general had eluded every attempt of heyward to worm from him the purport of the communication he had proposed making, or on the decided, though still polished message, by which he now gave his enemy to underst that, unless he chose to receive it in person, he should not receive it at all. </s>
<s>  as munro listened to the detail of duncan, the excited feelings of the father gradually gave way before the obligations of his station, and when the other was done, he saw before him nothing but the veteran, swelling with the wounded feelings of a soldier. </s>
<s>  "you have said enough, major heyward," exclaimed the angry old man. </s>
<s>  "enough to make a volume of commentary on french civility. </s>
<s>  here has this gentleman invited me to a conference, and when i send him a capable substitute, for ye're all that, duncan, though your years are but few, he answers me with a riddle. </s>
<s> " "he may have thought less favorably of the substitute, my dear sir. </s>
<s>  and you will remember that the invitation, which he now repeats, was to the commandant of the works, and not to his second. </s>
<s> " "well, sir, is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity of him who grants the commission? he wishes to confer with munro! faith, sir, i have much inclination to indulge the man, if it should only be to let him behold the firm countenance we maintain in spite of his numbers and his summons. </s>
<s>  there might be not bad policy in such a stroke, young man. </s>
<s> " duncan, who believe it of the last importance that they should speedily come to the contents of the letter borne by the scout, gladly encouraged this idea. </s>
<s>  "without doubt, he could gather no confidence by witnessing our indifference," he said. </s>
<s>  "you never said truer word. </s>
<s>  i could wish, sir, that he would visit the works in open day, and in the form of a storming party. </s>
<s>  that is the least failing method of proving the countenance of an enemy, and would be far preferable to the battering system he has chosen. </s>
<s>  the beauty and manliness of warfare has been much deformed, major heyward, by the arts of your monsieur vauban. </s>
<s>  our ancestors were far above such scientific cowardice!" "it may be very true, sir. </s>
<s>  but we are now obliged to repel art by art. </s>
<s>  what is your pleasure in the matter of the interview?" "i will meet the frenchman, and that without fear or delay. </s>
<s>  promptly, sir, as becomes a servant of my royal master. </s>
<s>  go, major heyward, and give them a flourish of the music. </s>
<s>  and send out a messenger to let them know who is coming. </s>
<s>  we will follow with a small guard, for such respect is due to one who holds the honor of his king in keeping. </s>
<s>  and hark'ee, duncan," he added, in a half whisper, though they were alone, "it may be prudent to have some aid at h in case there should be treachery at the bottom of it all. </s>
<s> " the young man availed himself of this order to quit the apartment. </s>
<s>   as the day was fast coming to a close, he hastened without delay, to make the necessary arrangements. </s>
<s>  a very few minutes only were necessary to parade a few files, and to dispatch an orderly with a flag to announce the approach of the commandant of the fort. </s>
<s>  when duncan had done both these, he led the guard to the sally-port, near which he found his superior ready, waiting his appearance. </s>
<s>  as soon as the usual ceremonials of a military departure were observed, the veteran and his more youthful companion left the fortress, attended by the escort. </s>
<s>  they had proceeded only a hundred yards from the works, when the little array which attended the french general to the conference was seen issuing from the hollow way which formed the bed of a brook that ran between the batteries of the besiegers and the fort. </s>
<s>  from the moment that munro left his own works to appear in front of his enemy's, his air had been gr and his step and countenance highly military. </s>
<s>  the instant he caught a glimpse of the white plume that waved in the hat of montcalm, his eye lighted, and age no longer appeared to possess any influence over his vast and still muscular person. </s>
<s>  "speak to the boys to be watchful, sir," he said, in an undertone, to duncan. </s>
<s>  "and to look well to their flints and steel, for one is never safe with a servant of these louis's. </s>
<s>  at the same time, we shall show them the front of men in deep security. </s>
<s>  ye'll understand me, major heyward!" he was interrupted by the clamor of a drum from the approaching frenchmen, which was immediately answered, when each party pushed an orderly in advance, bearing a white flag, and the wary scotsman halted with his guard close at his back. </s>
<s>  as soon as this slight salutation had passed, montcalm moved toward them with a quick but graceful step, baring his head to the veteran, and dropping his spotless plume nearly to the earth in courtesy. </s>
<s>  if the air of munro was more commanding and manly, it wanted both the ease and insinuating polish of that of the frenchman. </s>
<s>  neither spoke for a few moments, each regarding the other with curious and interested eyes. </s>
<s>  then, as became his superior rank and the nature of the interview, montcalm broke the silence. </s>
<s>  after uttering the usual words of greeting, he turned to duncan, and continued, with a smile of recognition, speaking always in french: "i am rejoiced, monsieur, that you have given us the pleasure of your company on this occasion. </s>
<s>  there will be no necessity to employ an ordinary interpreter. </s>
<s>  for, in your hands, i feel the same security as if i spoke your language myself. </s>
<s> " duncan acknowledged the compliment, when montcalm, turning to his guard, which in imitation of that of their enemies, pressed close upon him, continued: "en arriere, mes enfants--il fait chaud--retirez-vous un peu. </s>
<s> " before major heyward would imitate this proof of confidence, he glanced his eyes around the plain, and beheld with uneasiness the numerous dusky groups of savages, who looked out from the margin of the surrounding woods, curious spectators of the interview. </s>
<s>  "monsieur de montcalm will readily acknowledge the difference in our situation," he said, with some embarrassment, pointing at the same time toward those dangerous foes, who were to be seen in almost every direction. </s>
<s>  "were we to dismiss our guard, we should stand here at the mercy of our enemies. </s>
<s> " "monsieur, you have the plighted faith of 'un gentilhomme fran‡ais', for your safety," returned montcalm, laying his hand impressively on his heart. </s>
<s>  "it should suffice. </s>
<s> " "it shall. </s>
<s>  fall back," duncan added to the officer who led the escort. </s>
<s>  "fall back, sir, beyond hearing, and wait for orders. </s>
<s> " munro witnessed this movement with manifest uneasiness. </s>
<s>  nor did he fail to demand an instant explanation. </s>
<s>  "is it not our interest, sir, to betray distrust?" retorted duncan. </s>
<s>  "monsieur de montcalm pledges his word for our safety, and i have ordered the men to withdraw a little, in order to prove how much we depend on his assurance. </s>
<s> " "it may be all right, sir, but i have no overweening reliance on the faith of these marquesses, or marquis, as they call themselves. </s>
<s>  their patents of nobility are too common to be certain that they bear the seal of true honor. </s>
<s> " "you forget, dear sir, that we confer with an officer, distinguished alike in europe and america for his deeds. </s>
<s>  from a soldier of his reputation we can have nothing to apprehend. </s>
<s> " the old man made a gesture of resignation, though his rigid features still betrayed his obstinate adherence to a distrust, which he derived from a sort of hereditary contempt of his enemy, rather than from any present signs which might warrant so uncharitable a feeling. </s>
<s>  montcalm waited patiently until this little dialogue in demi-voice was ended, when he drew nigher, and opened the subject of their conference. </s>
<s>  "i have solicited this interview from your superior, monsieur," he said, "because i believe he will allow himself to be persuaded that he has already done everything which is necessary for the honor of his prince, and will now listen to the admonitions of humanity. </s>
<s>  i will forever bear testimony that his resistance has been gallant, and was continued as long as there was hope. </s>
<s> " when this opening was translated to munro, he answered with dignity, but with sufficient courtesy: "however i may prize such testimony from monsieur montcalm, it will be more valuable when it shall be better merited. </s>
<s> " the french general smiled, as duncan gave him the purport of this reply, and observed: "what is now so freely accorded to approved courage, may be refused to useless obstinacy. </s>
<s>  monsieur would wish to see my camp, and witness for himself our numbers, and the impossibility of his resisting them with success?" "i know that the king of france is well served," returned the unmoved scotsman, as soon as duncan ended his translation. </s>
<s>  "but my own royal master has as many and as faithful troops. </s>
<s> " "though not at h fortunately for us," said montcalm, without waiting, in his ardor, for the interpreter. </s>
<s>  "there is a destiny in war, to which a brave man knows how to submit with the same courage that he faces his foes. </s>
<s> " "had i been conscious that monsieur montcalm was master of the english, i should have spared myself the trouble of so awkward a translation," said the vexed duncan, dryly. </s>
<s>  remembering instantly his recent by-play with munro. </s>
<s>  "your pardon, monsieur," rejoined the frenchman, suffering a slight color to appear on his dark cheek. </s>
<s>  "there is a vast difference between understanding and speaking a foreign tongue. </s>
<s>  you will, therefore, please to assist me still. </s>
<s> " then, after a short pause, he added: "these hills afford us every opportunity of reconnoitering your works, messieurs, and i am possibly as well acquainted with their weak condition as you can be yourselves. </s>
<s> " "ask the french general if his glasses can reach to the hudson," said munro, proudly. </s>
<s>  "and if he knows when and where to expect the army of webb. </s>
<s> " "let general webb be his own interpreter," returned the politic montcalm, suddenly extending an open letter toward munro as he spoke. </s>
<s>  "you will there learn, monsieur, that his movements are not likely to prove embarrassing to my army. </s>
<s> " the veteran seized the offered paper, without waiting for duncan to translate the speech, and with an eagerness that betrayed how important he deemed its contents. </s>
<s>  as his eye passed hastily over the words, his countenance changed from its look of military pride to one of deep chagrin. </s>
<s>  his lip began to quiver. </s>
<s>  and suffering the paper to fall from his h his head dropped upon his chest, like that of a man whose hopes were withered at a single blow. </s>
<s>  duncan caught the letter from the ground, and without apology for the liberty he took, he read at a glance its cruel purport. </s>
<s>  their common superior, so far from encouraging them to resist, advised a speedy surrender, urging in the plainest language, as a reason, the utter impossibility of his sending a single man to their rescue. </s>
<s>  "here is no deception!" exclaimed duncan, examining the billet both inside and out. </s>
<s>  "this is the signature of webb, and must be the captured letter. </s>
<s> " "the man has betrayed me!" munro at length bitterly exclaimed. </s>
<s>  "he has brought dishonor to the door of one where disgrace was never before known to dwell, and shame has he heaped heavily on my gray hairs. </s>
<s> " "say not so," cried duncan. </s>
<s>  "we are yet masters of the fort, and of our honor. </s>
<s>  let us, then, sell our lives at such a rate as shall make our enemies believe the purchase too dear. </s>
<s> " "boy, i thank thee," exclaimed the old man, rousing himself from his stupor. </s>
<s>  "you have, for once, reminded munro of his duty. </s>
<s>  we will go back, and dig our graves behind those ramparts. </s>
<s> " "messieurs," said montcalm, advancing toward them a step, in generous interest, "you little know louis de st. </s>
<s>  veran if you believe him capable of profiting by this letter to humble brave men, or to build up a dishonest reputation for himself. </s>
<s>  listen to my terms before you leave me. </s>
<s> " "what says the frenchman?" demanded the veteran, sternly. </s>
<s>  "does he make a merit of having captured a scout, with a note from headquarters? sir, he had better raise this siege, to go and sit down before edward if he wishes to frighten his enemy with words. </s>
<s> " duncan explained the other's meaning. </s>
<s>  "monsieur de montcalm, we will hear you," the veteran added, more calmly, as duncan ended. </s>
<s>  "to retain the fort is now impossible," said his liberal enemy. </s>
<s>  "it is necessary to the interests of my master that it should be destroyed. </s>
<s>  but as for yourselves and your brave comrades, there is no privilege dear to a soldier that shall be denied. </s>
<s> " "our colors?" demanded heyward. </s>
<s>  "carry them to engl and show them to your king. </s>
<s> " "our arms?" "keep them. </s>
<s>  none can use them better. </s>
<s> " "our march. </s>
<s>  the surrender of the place?" "shall all be done in a way most honorable to yourselves. </s>
<s> " duncan now turned to explain these proposals to his commander, who heard him with amazement, and a sensibility that was deeply touched by so unusual and unexpected generosity. </s>
<s>  "go you, duncan," he said. </s>
<s>  "go with this marquess, as, indeed, marquess he should be. </s>
<s>  go to his marquee and arrange it all. </s>
<s>  i have lived to see two things in my old age that never did i expect to behold. </s>
<s>  an englishman afraid to support a friend, and a frenchman too honest to profit by his advantage. </s>
<s> " so saying, the veteran again dropped his head to his chest, and returned slowly toward the fort, exhibiting, by the dejection of his air, to the anxious garrison, a harbinger of evil tidings. </s>
<s>  from the shock of this unexpected blow the haughty feelings of munro never recovered. </s>
<s>  but from that moment there commenced a change in his determined character, which accompanied him to a speedy grave. </s>
<s>  duncan remained to settle the terms of the capitulation. </s>
<s>  he was seen to re- enter the works during the first watches of the night, and immediately after a private conference with the commandant, to leave them again. </s>
<s>  it was then openly announced that hostilities must cease--munro having signed a treaty by which the place was to be yielded to the enemy, with the morning. </s>
<s>  the garrison to retain their arms, the colors and their baggage,  consequently, according to military opinion, their honor. </s>
<s>  chapter 17 "weave we the woof. </s>
<s>  the thread is spun. </s>
<s>  the web is wove. </s>
<s>  the work is done. </s>
<s> "--gray the hostile armies, which lay in the wilds of the horican, passed the night of the ninth of august, 1757, much in the manner they would, had they encountered on the fairest field of europe. </s>
<s>  while the conquered were still, sullen, and dejected, the victors triumphed. </s>
<s>  but there are limits alike to grief and joy. </s>
<s>  and long before the watches of the morning came the stillness of those boundless woods was only broken by a gay call from some exulting young frenchman of the advanced pickets, or a menacing challenge from the fort, which sternly forbade the approach of any hostile footsteps before the stipulated moment. </s>
<s>  even these occasional threatening sounds ceased to be heard in that dull hour which precedes the day, at which period a listener might have sought in vain any evidence of the presence of those armed powers that then slumbered on the shores of the "holy lake. </s>
<s> " it was during these moments of deep silence that the canvas which concealed the entrance to a spacious marquee in the french encampment was shoved aside, and a man issued from beneath the drapery into the open air. </s>
<s>  he was enveloped in a cloak that might have been intended as a protection from the chilling damps of the woods, but which served equally well as a mantle to conceal his person. </s>
<s>  he was permitted to pass the grenadier, who watched over the slumbers of the french commander, without interruption, the man making the usual salute which betokens military deference, as the other passed swiftly through the little city of tents, in the direction of william henry. </s>
<s>  whenever this unknown individual encountered one of the numberless sentinels who crossed his path, his answer was prompt,  as it appeared, satisfactory. </s>
<s>  for he was uniformly allowed to proceed without further interrogation. </s>
<s>  with the exception of such repeated but brief interruptions, he had moved silently from the center of the camp to its most advanced outposts, when he drew nigh the soldier who held his watch nearest to the works of the enemy. </s>
<s>  as he approached he was received with the usual challenge: "qui vive?" "france," was the reply. </s>
<s>  "le mot d'ordre?" "la victorie," said the other, drawing so nigh as to be heard in a loud whisper. </s>
<s>  "c'est bien," returned the sentinel, throwing his musket from the charge to his shoulder. </s>
<s>  "vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!" "il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant," the other observed, dropping a fold of his cloak, and looking the soldier close in the face as he passed him, still continuing his way toward the british fortification. </s>
<s>  the man started. </s>
<s>  his arms rattled heavily as he threw them forward in the lowest and most respectful salute. </s>
<s>  and when he had again recovered his piece, he turned to walk his post, muttering between his teeth: "il faut etre vigilant, en verite! je crois que nous avons la, un caporal qui ne dort jamais!" the officer proceeded, without affecting to hear the words which escaped the sentinel in his surprise. </s>
<s>  nor did he again pause until he had reached the low str and in a somewhat dangerous vicinity to the western water bastion of the fort. </s>
<s>  the light of an obscure moon was just sufficient to render objects, though dim, perceptible in their outlines. </s>
<s>  he, therefore, took the precaution to place himself against the trunk of a tree, where he leaned for many minutes, and seemed to contemplate the dark and silent mounds of the english works in profound attention. </s>
<s>  his gaze at the ramparts was not that of a curious or idle spectator. </s>
<s>  but his looks wandered from point to point, denoting his knowledge of military usages, and betraying that his search was not unaccompanied by distrust. </s>
<s>  at length he appeared satisfied. </s>
<s>  and having cast his eyes impatiently upward toward the summit of the eastern mountain, as if anticipating the approach of the morning, he was in the act of turning on his footsteps, when a light sound on the nearest angle of the bastion caught his ear, and induced him to remain. </s>
<s>  just then a figure was seen to approach the edge of the rampart, where it stood, apparently contemplating in its turn the distant tents of the french encampment. </s>
<s>  its head was then turned toward the east, as though equally anxious for the appearance of light, when the form leaned against the mound, and seemed to gaze upon the glassy expanse of the waters, which, like a submarine firmament, glittered with its thousand mimic stars. </s>
<s>  the melancholy air, the hour, together with the vast frame of the man who thus leaned, musing, against the english ramparts, left no doubt as to his person in the mind of the observant spectator. </s>
<s>  delicacy, no less than prudence, now urged him to retire. </s>
<s>  and he had moved cautiously round the body of the tree for that purpose, when another sound drew his attention, and once more arrested his footsteps. </s>
<s>  it was a low and almost inaudible movement of the water, and was succeeded by a grating of pebbles one against the other. </s>
<s>  in a moment he saw a dark form rise, as it were, out of the lake, and steal without further noise to the l within a few feet of the place where he himself stood. </s>
<s>  a rifle next slowly rose between his eyes and the watery mirror. </s>
<s>  but before it could be discharged his own hand was on the lock. </s>
<s>  "hugh!" exclaimed the savage, whose treacherous aim was so singularly and so unexpectedly interrupted. </s>
<s>  without making any reply, the french officer laid his hand on the shoulder of the indian, and led him in profound silence to a distance from the spot, where their subsequent dialogue might have proved dangerous, and where it seemed that one of them, at least, sought a victim. </s>
<s>  then throwing open his cloak, so as to expose his uniform and the cross of st. </s>
<s>  louis which was suspended at his breast, montcalm sternly demanded: "what means this? does not my son know that the hatchet is buried between the english and his canadian father?" "what can the hurons do?" returned the savage, speaking also, though imperfectly, in the french language. </s>
<s>  "not a warrior has a scalp, and the pale faces make friends!" "ha, le renard subtil! methinks this is an excess of zeal for a friend who was so late an enemy! how many suns have set since le renard struck the war-post of the english?" "where is that sun?" demanded the sullen savage. </s>
<s>  "behind the hill. </s>
<s>  and it is dark and cold. </s>
<s>  but when he comes again, it will be bright and warm. </s>
<s>  le subtil is the sun of his tribe. </s>
<s>  there have been clouds, and many mountains between him and his nation. </s>
<s>  but now he shines and it is a clear sky!" "that le renard has power with his people, i well know," said montcalm. </s>
<s>  "for yesterday he hunted for their scalps, and to-day they hear him at the council-fire. </s>
<s> " "magua is a great chief. </s>
<s> " "let him prove it, by teaching his nation how to conduct themselves toward our new friends. </s>
<s> " "why did the chief of the canadas bring his young men into the woods, and fire his cannon at the earthen house?" demanded the subtle indian. </s>
<s>  "to subdue it. </s>
<s>  my master owns the l and your father was ordered to drive off these english squatters. </s>
<s>  they have consented to go, and now he calls them enemies no longer. </s>
<s> " "'tis well. </s>
<s>  magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. </s>
<s>  it is now bright. </s>
<s>  when it is red, it shall be buried. </s>
<s> " "but magua is pledged not to sully the lilies of france. </s>
<s>  the enemies of the great king across the salt lake are his enemies. </s>
<s>  his friends, the friends of the hurons. </s>
<s> " "friends!" repeated the indian in scorn. </s>
<s>  "let his father give magua a hand. </s>
<s> " montcalm, who felt that his influence over the warlike tribes he had gathered was to be maintained by concession rather than by power, complied reluctantly with the other's request. </s>
<s>  the savage placed the fingers of the french commander on a deep scar in his bosom, and then exultingly demanded: "does my father know that?" "what warrior does not? 'tis where a leaden bullet has cut. </s>
<s> " "and this?" continued the indian, who had turned his naked back to the other, his body being without its usual calico mantle. </s>
<s>  "this!--my son has been sadly injured here. </s>
<s>  who has done this?" "magua slept hard in the english wigwams, and the sticks have left their mark," returned the savage, with a hollow laugh, which did not conceal the fierce temper that nearly choked him. </s>
<s>  then, recollecting himself, with sudden and native dignity, he added: "go. </s>
<s>  teach your young men it is peace. </s>
<s>  le renard subtil knows how to speak to a huron warrior. </s>
<s> " without deigning to bestow further words, or to wait for any answer, the savage cast his rifle into the hollow of his arm, and moved silently through the encampment toward the woods where his own tribe was known to lie. </s>
<s>  every few yards as he proceeded he was challenged by the sentinels. </s>
<s>  but he stalked sullenly onward, utterly disregarding the summons of the soldiers, who only spared his life because they knew the air and tread no less than the obstinate daring of an indian. </s>
<s>  montcalm lingered long and melancholy on the strand where he had been left by his companion, brooding deeply on the temper which his ungovernable ally had just discovered. </s>
<s>  already had his fair fame been tarnished by one horrid scene, and in circumstances fearfully resembling those under which he how found himself. </s>
<s>  as he mused he became keenly sensible of the deep responsibility they assume who disregard the means to attain the end, and of all the danger of setting in motion an engine which it exceeds human power to control. </s>
<s>  then shaking off a train of reflections that he accounted a weakness in such a moment of triumph, he retraced his steps toward his tent, giving the order as he passed to make the signal that should arouse the army from its slumbers. </s>
<s>  the first tap of the french drums was echoed from the bosom of the fort, and presently the valley was filled with the strains of martial music, rising long, thrilling and lively above the rattling accompaniment. </s>
<s>  the horns of the victors sounded merry and cheerful flourishes, until the last laggard of the camp was at his post. </s>
<s>  but the instant the british fifes had blown their shrill signal, they became mute. </s>
<s>  in the meantime the day had dawned, and when the line of the french army was ready to receive its general, the rays of a brilliant sun were glancing along the glittering array. </s>
<s>  then that success, which was already so well known, was officially announced. </s>
<s>  the favored band who were selected to guard the gates of the fort were detailed, and defiled before their chief. </s>
<s>  the signal of their approach was given, and all the usual preparations for a change of masters were ordered and executed directly under the guns of the contested works. </s>
<s>  a very different scene presented itself within the lines of the anglo-american army. </s>
<s>  as soon as the warning signal was given, it exhibited all the signs of a hurried and forced departure. </s>
<s>  the sullen soldiers shouldered their empty tubes and fell into their places, like men whose blood had been heated by the past contest, and who only desired the opportunity to revenge an indignity which was still wounding to their pride, concealed as it was under the observances of military etiquette. </s>
<s>  women and children ran from place to place, some bearing the scanty remnants of their baggage, and others searching in the ranks for those countenances they looked up to for protection. </s>
<s>  munro appeared among his silent troops firm but dejected. </s>
<s>  it was evident that the unexpected blow had struck deep into his heart, though he struggled to sustain his misfortune with the port of a man. </s>
<s>  duncan was touched at the quiet and impressive exhibition of his grief. </s>
<s>  he had discharged his own duty, and he now pressed to the side of the old man, to know in what particular he might serve him. </s>
<s>  "my daughters," was the brief but expressive reply. </s>
<s>  "good heavens! are not arrangements already made for their convenience?" "to-day i am only a soldier, major heyward," said the veteran. </s>
<s>  "all that you see here, claim alike to be my children. </s>
<s> " duncan had heard enough. </s>
<s>  without losing one of those moments which had now become so precious, he flew toward the quarters of munro, in quest of the sisters. </s>
<s>  he found them on the threshold of the low edifice, already prepared to depart, and surrounded by a clamorous and weeping assemblage of their own sex, that had gathered about the place, with a sort of instinctive consciousness that it was the point most likely to be protected. </s>
<s>  though the cheeks of cora were pale and her countenance anxious, she had lost none of her firmness. </s>
<s>  but the eyes of alice were inflamed, and betrayed how long and bitterly she had wept. </s>
<s>  they both, however, received the young man with undisguised pleasure. </s>
<s>  the former, for a novelty, being the first to speak. </s>
<s>  "the fort is lost," she said, with a melancholy smile. </s>
<s>  "though our good name, i trust, remains. </s>
<s> " "'tis brighter than ever. </s>
<s>   dearest miss munro, it is time to think less of others, and to make some provision for yourself. </s>
<s>  military usage--pride--that pride on which you so much value yourself, demands that your father and i should for a little while continue with the troops. </s>
<s>  then where to seek a proper protector for you against the confusion and chances of such a scene?" "none is necessary," returned cora. </s>
<s>  "who will dare to injure or insult the daughter of such a father, at a time like this?" "i would not leave you alone," continued the youth, looking about him in a hurried manner, "for the command of the best regiment in the pay of the king. </s>
<s>  remember, our alice is not gifted with all your firmness, and god only knows the terror she might endure. </s>
<s> " "you may be right," cora replied, smiling again, but far more sadly than before. </s>
<s>  "listen! chance has already sent us a friend when he is most needed. </s>
<s> " duncan did listen, and on the instant comprehended her meaning. </s>
<s>  the low and serious sounds of the sacred music, so well known to the eastern provinces, caught his ear, and instantly drew him to an apartment in an adjacent building, which had already been deserted by its customary tenants. </s>
<s>  there he found david, pouring out his pious feelings through the only medium in which he ever indulged. </s>
<s>  duncan waited, until, by the cessation of the movement of the h he believed the strain was ended, when, by touching his shoulder, he drew the attention of the other to himself, and in a few words explained his wishes. </s>
<s>  "even so," replied the single-minded disciple of the king of israel, when the young man had ended. </s>
<s>  "i have found much that is comely and melodious in the maidens, and it is fitting that we who have consorted in so much peril, should abide together in peace. </s>
<s>  i will attend them, when i have completed my morning praise, to which nothing is now wanting but the doxology. </s>
<s>  wilt thou bear a part, friend? the meter is common, and the tune 'southwell'. </s>
<s> " then, extending the little volume, and giving the pitch of the air anew with considerate attention, david recommenced and finished his strains, with a fixedness of manner that it was not easy to interrupt. </s>
<s>  heyward was fain to wait until the verse was ended. </s>
<s>  when, seeing david relieving himself from the spectacles, and replacing the book, he continued. </s>
<s>  "it will be your duty to see that none dare to approach the ladies with any rude intention, or to offer insult or taunt at the misfortune of their brave father. </s>
<s>  in this task you will be seconded by the domestics of their household. </s>
<s> " "even so. </s>
<s> " "it is possible that the indians and stragglers of the enemy may intrude, in which case you will remind them of the terms of the capitulation, and threaten to report their conduct to montcalm. </s>
<s>  a word will suffice. </s>
<s> " "if not, i have that here which shall," returned david, exhibiting his book, with an air in which meekness and confidence were singularly blended. </s>
<s>  here are words which, uttered, or rather thundered, with proper emphasis, and in measured time, shall quiet the most unruly temper: "'why rage the heathen furiously'?" "enough," said heyward, interrupting the burst of his musical invocation. </s>
<s>  "we understand each other. </s>
<s>  it is time that we should now assume our respective duties. </s>
<s> " gamut cheerfully assented, and together they sought the females. </s>
<s>  cora received her new and somewhat extraordinary protector courteously, at least. </s>
<s>  and even the pallid features of alice lighted again with some of their native archness as she thanked heyward for his care. </s>
<s>  duncan took occasion to assure them he had done the best that circumstances permitted,  as he believed, quite enough for the security of their feelings. </s>
<s>  of danger there was none. </s>
<s>  he then spoke gladly of his intention to rejoin them the moment he had led the advance a few miles toward the hudson, and immediately took his leave. </s>
<s>  by this time the signal for departure had been given, and the head of the english column was in motion. </s>
<s>  the sisters started at the sound, and glancing their eyes around, they saw the white uniforms of the french grenadiers, who had already taken possession of the gates of the fort. </s>
<s>  at that moment an enormous cloud seemed to pass suddenly above their heads,  looking upward, they discovered that they stood beneath the wide folds of the standard of france. </s>
<s>  "let us go," said cora. </s>
<s>  "this is no longer a fit place for the children of an english officer. </s>
<s> " alice clung to the arm of her sister, and together they left the parade, accompanied by the moving throng that surrounded them. </s>
<s>  as they passed the gates, the french officers, who had learned their rank, bowed often and low, forbearing, however, to intrude those attentions which they saw, with peculiar tact, might not be agreeable. </s>
<s>  as every vehicle and each beast of burden was occupied by the sick and wounded, cora had decided to endure the fatigues of a foot march, rather than interfere with their comforts. </s>
<s>  indeed, many a maimed and feeble soldier was compelled to drag his exhausted limbs in the rear of the columns, for the want of the necessary means of conveyance in that wilderness. </s>
<s>  the whole, however, was in motion. </s>
<s>  the weak and wounded, groaning and in suffering. </s>
<s>  their comrades silent and sullen. </s>
<s>  and the women and children in terror, they knew not of what. </s>
<s>  as the confused and timid throng left the protecting mounds of the fort, and issued on the open plain, the whole scene was at once presented to their eyes. </s>
<s>  at a little distance on the right, and somewhat in the rear, the french army stood to their arms, montcalm having collected his parties, so soon as his guards had possession of the works. </s>
<s>  they were attentive but silent observers of the proceedings of the vanquished, failing in none of the stipulated military honors, and offering no taunt or insult, in their success, to their less fortunate foes. </s>
<s>  living masses of the english, to the amount, in the whole, of near three thous were moving slowly across the plain, toward the common center, and gradually approached each other, as they converged to the point of their march, a vista cut through the lofty trees, where the road to the hudson entered the forest. </s>
<s>  along the sweeping borders of the woods hung a dark cloud of savages, eyeing the passage of their enemies, and hovering at a distance, like vultures who were only kept from swooping on their prey by the presence and restraint of a superior army. </s>
<s>  a few had straggled among the conquered columns, where they stalked in sullen discontent. </s>
<s>  attentive, though, as yet, passive observers of the moving multitude. </s>
<s>  the advance, with heyward at its head, had already reached the defile, and was slowly disappearing, when the attention of cora was drawn to a collection of stragglers by the sounds of contention. </s>
<s>  a truant provincial was paying the forfeit of his disobedience, by being plundered of those very effects which had caused him to desert his place in the ranks. </s>
<s>  the man was of powerful frame, and too avaricious to part with his goods without a struggle. </s>
<s>  individuals from either party interfered. </s>
<s>  the one side to prevent and the other to aid in the robbery. </s>
<s>  voices grew loud and angry, and a hundred savages appeared, as it were, by magic, where a dozen only had been seen a minute before. </s>
<s>  it was then that cora saw the form of magua gliding among his countrymen, and speaking with his fatal and artful eloquence. </s>
<s>  the mass of women and children stopped, and hovered together like alarmed and fluttering birds. </s>
<s>  but the cupidity of the indian was soon gratified, and the different bodies again moved slowly onward. </s>
<s>  the savages now fell back, and seemed content to let their enemies advance without further molestation. </s>
<s>   as the female crowd approached them, the gaudy colors of a shawl attracted the eyes of a wild and untutored huron. </s>
<s>  he advanced to seize it without the least hesitation. </s>
<s>  the woman, more in terror than through love of the ornament, wrapped her child in the coveted article, and folded both more closely to her bosom. </s>
<s>  cora was in the act of speaking, with an intent to advise the woman to abandon the trifle, when the savage relinquished his hold of the shawl, and tore the screaming infant from her arms. </s>
<s>  abandoning everything to the greedy grasp of those around her, the mother darted, with distraction in her mien, to reclaim her child. </s>
<s>  the indian smiled grimly, and extended one h in sign of a willingness to exchange, while, with the other, he flourished the babe over his head, holding it by the feet as if to enhance the value of the ransom. </s>
<s>  "here--here--there--all--any--everything!" exclaimed the breathless woman, tearing the lighter articles of dress from her person with ill-directed and trembling fingers. </s>
<s>  "take all, but give me my babe!" the savage spurned the worthless rags, and perceiving that the shawl had already become a prize to another, his bantering but sullen smile changing to a gleam of ferocity, he dashed the head of the infant against a rock, and cast its quivering remains to her very feet. </s>
<s>  for an instant the mother stood, like a statue of despair, looking wildly down at the unseemly object, which had so lately nestled in her bosom and smiled in her face. </s>
<s>  and then she raised her eyes and countenance toward heaven, as if calling on god to curse the perpetrator of the foul deed. </s>
<s>  she was spared the sin of such a prayer for, maddened at his disappointment, and excited at the sight of blood, the huron mercifully drove his tomahawk into her own brain. </s>
<s>  the mother sank under the blow, and fell, grasping at her child, in death, with the same engrossing love that had caused her to cherish it when living. </s>
<s>  at that dangerous moment, magua placed his hands to his mouth, and raised the fatal and appalling whoop. </s>
<s>  the scattered indians started at the well-known cry, as coursers bound at the signal to quit the goal. </s>
<s>  and directly there arose such a yell along the plain, and through the arches of the wood, as seldom burst from human lips before. </s>
<s>  they who heard it listened with a curdling horror at the heart, little inferior to that dread which may be expected to attend the blasts of the final summons. </s>
<s>  more than two thousand raving savages broke from the forest at the signal, and threw themselves across the fatal plain with instinctive alacrity. </s>
<s>  we shall not dwell on the revolting horrors that succeeded. </s>
<s>  death was everywhere, and in his most terrific and disgusting aspects. </s>
<s>  resistance only served to inflame the murderers, who inflicted their furious blows long after their victims were beyond the power of their resentment. </s>
<s>  the flow of blood might be likened to the outbreaking of a torrent. </s>
<s>  and as the natives became heated and maddened by the sight, many among them even kneeled to the earth, and drank freely, exultingly, hellishly, of the crimson tide. </s>
<s>  the trained bodies of the troops threw themselves quickly into solid masses, endeavoring to awe their assailants by the imposing appearance of a military front. </s>
<s>  the experiment in some measure succeeded, though far too many suffered their unloaded muskets to be torn from their hands, in the vain hope of appeasing the savages. </s>
<s>  in such a scene none had leisure to note the fleeting moments. </s>
<s>  it might have been ten minutes , and bring in the tidings to edward?" the scout, remembering only his own sturdy and iron nature, had probably exacted a task that david, under no circumstances, could have performed. </s>
<s>   without entirely losing the meekness of his air, the latter was content to answer: "though my soul would rejoice to visit the habitations of christendom once more, my feet would rather follow the tender spirits intrusted to my keeping, even into the idolatrous province of the jesuits, than take one step backward, while they pined in captivity and sorrow. </s>
<s> " though the figurative language of david was not very intelligible, the sincere and steady expression of his eye, and the glow of his honest countenance, were not easily mistaken. </s>
<s>  uncas pressed closer to his side, and regarded the speaker with a look of commendation, while his father expressed his satisfaction by the ordinary pithy exclamation of approbation. </s>
<s>  the scout shook his head as he rejoined: "the lord never intended that the man should place all his endeavors in his throat, to the neglect of other and better gifts! but he has fallen into the hands of some silly woman, when he should have been gathering his education under a blue sky, among the beauties of the forest. </s>
<s>  here, friend. </s>
<s>  i did intend to kindle a fire with this tooting- whistle of thine. </s>
<s>   as you value the thing, take it, and blow your best on it. </s>
<s> " gamut received his pitch-pipe with as strong an expression of pleasure as he believed compatible with the grave functions he exercised. </s>
<s>  after essaying its virtues repeatedly, in contrast with his own voice,  satisfying himself that none of its melody was lost, he made a very serious demonstration toward achieving a few stanzas of one of the longest effusions in the little volume so often mentioned. </s>
<s>  heyward, however, hastily interrupted his pious purpose by continuing questions concerning the past and present condition of his fellow captives, and in a manner more methodical than had been permitted by his feelings in the opening of their interview. </s>
<s>  david, though he regarded his treasure with longing eyes, was constrained to answer, especially as the venerable father took a part in the interrogatories, with an interest too imposing to be denied. </s>
<s>  nor did the scout fail to throw in a pertinent inquiry, whenever a fitting occasion presented. </s>
<s>  in this manner, though with frequent interruptions which were filled with certain threatening sounds from the recovered instrument, the pursuers were put in possession of such leading circumstances as were likely to prove useful in accomplishing their great and engrossing object--the recovery of the sisters. </s>
<s>  the narrative of david was simple, and the facts but few. </s>
<s>  magua had waited on the mountain until a safe moment to retire presented itself, when he had descended, and taken the route along the western side of the horican in direction of the canadas. </s>
<s>  as the subtle huron was familiar with the paths, and well knew there was no immediate danger of pursuit, their progress had been moderate, and far from fatiguing. </s>
<s>  it appeared from the unembellished statement of david, that his own presence had been rather endured than desired. </s>
<s>  though even magua had not been entirely exempt from that veneration with which the indians regard those whom the great spirit had visited in their intellects. </s>
<s>  at night, the utmost care had been taken of the captives, both to prevent injury from the damps of the woods and to guard against an escape. </s>
<s>  at the spring, the horses were turned loose, as has been seen. </s>
<s>   notwithstanding the remoteness and length of their trail, the artifices already named were resorted to, in order to cut off every clue to their place of retreat. </s>
<s>  on their arrival at the encampment of his people, magua, in obedience to a policy seldom departed from, separated his prisoners. </s>
<s>  cora had been sent to a tribe that temporarily occupied an adjacent valley, though david was far too ignorant of the customs and history of the natives, to be able to declare anything satisfactory concerning their name or character. </s>
<s>  he only knew that they had not engaged in the late expedition against william henry. </s>
<s>  that, like the hurons themselves they were allies of montcalm. </s>
<s>  and that they maintained an amicable, though a watchful intercourse with the warlike and savage people whom chance had, for a time, brought in such close and disagreeable contact with themselves. </s>
<s>  the mohicans and the scout listened to his interrupted and imperfect narrative, with an interest that obviously increased as he proceeded. </s>
<s>  and it was while attempting to explain the pursuits of the community in which cora was detained, that the latter abruptly demanded: "did you see the fashion of their knives? wee they of english or french formation?" "my thoughts were bent on no such vanities, but rather mingled in consolation with those of the maidens. </s>
<s> " "the time may come when you will not consider the knife of a savage such a despicable vanity," returned the scout, with a strong expression of contempt for the other's dullness. </s>
<s>  "had they held their corn feast--or can you say anything of the totems of the tribe?" "of corn, we had many and plentiful feasts. </s>
<s>  for the grain, being in the milk is both sweet to the mouth and comfortable to the stomach. </s>
<s>  of totem, i know not the meaning. </s>
<s>  but if it appertaineth in any wise to the art of indian music, it need not be inquired after at their hands. </s>
<s>  they never join their voices in praise, and it would seem that they are among the profanest of the idolatrous. </s>
<s> " "therein you belie the natur' of an indian. </s>
<s>  even the mingo adores but the true and loving god. </s>
<s>  'tis wicked fabrication of the whites, and i say it to the shame of my color that would make the warrior bow down before images of his own creation. </s>
<s>  it is true, they endeavor to make truces to the wicked one--as who would not with an enemy he cannot conquer! but they look up for favor and assistance to the great and good spirit only. </s>
<s> " "it may be so," said david. </s>
<s>  "but i have seen strange and fantastic images drawn in their paint, of which their admiration and care savored of spiritual pride. </s>
<s>  especially one, and that, too, a foul and loathsome object. </s>
<s> " "was it a sarpent?" quickly demanded the scout. </s>
<s>  "much the same. </s>
<s>  it was in the likeness of an abject and creeping tortoise. </s>
<s> " "hugh!" exclaimed both the attentive mohicans in a breath. </s>
<s>  while the scout shook his head with the air of one who had made an important but by no means a pleasing discovery. </s>
<s>  then the father spoke, in the language of the delawares, and with a calmness and dignity that instantly arrested the attention even of those to whom his words were unintelligible. </s>
<s>  his gestures were impressive, and at times energetic. </s>
<s>  once he lifted his arm on high. </s>
<s>   as it descended, the action threw aside the folds of his light mantle, a finger resting on his breast, as if he would enforce his meaning by the attitude. </s>
<s>  duncan's eyes followed the movement, and he perceived that the animal just mentioned was beautifully, though faintly, worked in blue tint, on the swarthy breast of the chief. </s>
<s>  all that he had ever heard of the violent separation of the vast tribes of the delawares rushed across his mind, and he awaited the proper moment to speak, with a suspense that was rendered nearly intolerable by his interest in the stake. </s>
<s>  his wish, however, was anticipated by the scout who turned from his red friend, saying: "we have found that which may be good or evil to us, as heaven disposes. </s>
<s>  the sagamore is of the high blood of the delawares, and is the great chief of their tortoises! that some of this stock are among the people of whom the singer tells us, is plain by his words. </s>
<s>   had he but spent half the breath in prudent questions that he has blown away in making a trumpet of his throat, we might have known how many warriors they numbered. </s>
<s>  it is, altogether, a dangerous path we move in. </s>
<s>  for a friend whose face is turned from you often bears a bloodier mind than the enemy who seeks your scalp. </s>
<s> " "explain," said duncan. </s>
<s>  "'tis a long and melancholy tradition, and one i little like to think of. </s>
<s>  for it is not to be denied that the evil has been mainly done by men with white skins. </s>
<s>  but it has ended in turning the tomahawk of brother against brother, and brought the mingo and the delaware to travel in the same path. </s>
<s> " "you, then, suspect it is a portion of that people among whom cora resides?" the scout nodded his head in assent, though he seemed anxious to waive the further discussion of a subject that appeared painful. </s>
<s>  the impatient duncan now made several hasty and desperate propositions to attempt the release of the sisters. </s>
<s>  munro seemed to shake off his apathy, and listened to the wild schemes of the young man with a deference that his gray hairs and reverend years should have denied. </s>
<s>  but the scout, after suffering the ardor of the lover to expend itself a little, found means to convince him of the folly of precipitation, in a manner that would require their coolest judgment and utmost fortitude. </s>
<s>  "it would be well," he added, "to let this man go in again, as usual, and for him to tarry in the lodges, giving notice to the gentle ones of our approach, until we call him out, by signal, to consult. </s>
<s>  you know the cry of a crow, friend, from the whistle of the whip-poor-will?" "'tis a pleasing bird," returned david, "and has a soft and melancholy note! though the time is rather quick and ill- measured. </s>
<s> " "he speaks of the wish-ton-wish," said the scout. </s>
<s>  "well, since you like his whistle, it shall be your signal. </s>
<s>  remember, then, when you hear the whip-poor-will's call three times repeated, you are to come into the bushes where the bird might be supposed--" "stop," interrupted heyward. </s>
<s>  "i will accompany him. </s>
<s> " "you!" exclaimed the astonished hawkeye. </s>
<s>  "are you tired of seeing the sun rise and set?" "david is a living proof that the hurons can be merciful. </s>
<s> " "ay, but david can use his throat, as no man in his senses would pervart the gift. </s>
<s> " "i too can play the madman, the fool, the hero. </s>
<s>  in short, any or everything to rescue her i love. </s>
<s>  name your objections no longer: i am resolved. </s>
<s> " hawkeye regarded the young man a moment in speechless amazement. </s>
<s>  but duncan, who, in deference to the other's skill and services, had hitherto submitted somewhat implicitly to his dictation, now assumed the superior, with a manner that was not easily resisted. </s>
<s>  he waved his h in sign of his dislike to all remonstrance, and then, in more tempered language, he continued: "you have the means of disguise. </s>
<s>  change me. </s>
<s>  paint me, too, if you will. </s>
<s>  in short, alter me to anything--a fool. </s>
<s> " "it is not for one like me to say that he who is already formed by so powerful a hand as providence, stands in need of a change," muttered the discontented scout. </s>
<s>  "when you send your parties abroad in war, you find it prudent, at least, to arrange the marks and places of encampment, in order that they who fight on your side may know when and where to expect a friend. </s>
<s> " "listen," interrupted duncan. </s>
<s>  "you have heard from this faithful follower of the captives, that the indians are of two tribes, if not of different nations. </s>
<s>  with one, whom you think to be a branch of the delawares, is she you call the 'dark-hair'. </s>
<s>  the other, and younger, of the ladies, is undeniably with our declared enemies, the hurons. </s>
<s>  it becomes my youth and rank to attempt the latter adventure. </s>
<s>  while you, therefore, are negotiating with your friends for the release of one of the sisters, i will effect that of the other, or die. </s>
<s> " the awakened spirit of the young soldier gleamed in his eyes, and his form became imposing under its influence. </s>
<s>  hawkeye, though too much accustomed to indian artifices not to foresee the danger of the experiment, knew not well how to combat this sudden resolution. </s>
<s>  perhaps there was something in the proposal that suited his own hardy nature, and that secret love of desperate adventure, which had increased with his experience, until hazard and danger had become, in some measure, necessary to the enjoyment of his existence. </s>
<s>  instead of continuing to oppose the scheme of duncan, his humor suddenly altered, and he lent himself to its execution. </s>
<s>  "come," he said, with a good-humored smile. </s>
<s>  "the buck that will take to the water must be headed, and not followed. </s>
<s>  chingachgook has as many different paints as the engineer officer's wife, who takes down natur' on scraps of paper, making the mountains look like cocks of rusty hay, and placing the blue sky in reach of your hand. </s>
<s>  the sagamore can use them, too. </s>
<s>  seat yourself on the log. </s>
<s>  and my life on it, he can soon make a natural fool of you, and that well to your liking. </s>
<s> " duncan complied. </s>
<s>  and the mohican, who had been an attentive listener to the discourse, readily undertook the office. </s>
<s>  long practised in all the subtle arts of his race, he drew, with great dexterity and quickness, the fantastic shadow that the natives were accustomed to consider as the evidence of a friendly and jocular disposition. </s>
<s>  every line that could possibly be interpreted into a secret inclination for war, was carefully avoided. </s>
<s>  while, on the other h he studied those conceits that might be construed into amity. </s>
<s>  in short, he entirely sacrificed every appearance of the warrior to the masquerade of a buffoon. </s>
<s>  such exhibitions were not uncommon among the indians, and as duncan was already sufficiently disguised in his dress, there certainly did exist some reason for believing that, with his knowledge of french, he might pass for a juggler from ticonderoga, straggling among the allied and friendly tribes. </s>
<s>  when he was thought to be sufficiently painted, the scout gave him much friendly advice. </s>
<s>  concerted signals, and appointed the place where they should meet, in the event of mutual success. </s>
<s>  the parting between munro and his young friend was more melancholy. </s>
<s>  still, the former submitted to the separation with an indifference that his warm and honest nature would never have permitted in a more healthful state of mind. </s>
<s>  the scout led heyward aside, and acquainted him with his intention to leave the veteran in some safe encampment, in charge of chingachgook, while he and uncas pursued their inquires among the people they had reason to believe were delawares. </s>
<s>  then, renewing his cautions and advice, he concluded by saying, with a solemnity and warmth of feeling, with which duncan was deeply touched: " now, god bless you! you have shown a spirit that i like. </s>
<s>  for it is the gift of youth, more especially one of warm blood and a stout heart. </s>
<s>  but believe the warning of a man who has reason to know all he says to be true. </s>
<s>  you will have occasion for your best manhood, and for a sharper wit than what is to be gathered in books, afore you outdo the cunning or get the better of the courage of a mingo. </s>
<s>  god bless you! if the hurons master your scalp, rely on the promise of one who has two stout warriors to back him. </s>
<s>  they shall pay for their victory, with a life for every hair it holds. </s>
<s>  i say, young gentleman, may providence bless your undertaking, which is altogether for good. </s>
<s>   remember, that to outwit the knaves it is lawful to practise things that may not be naturally the gift of a white-skin. </s>
<s> " duncan shook his worthy and reluctant associate warmly by the h once more recommended his aged friend to his care, and returning his good wishes, he motioned to david to proceed. </s>
<s>  hawkeye gazed after the high-spirited and adventurous young man for several moments, in open admiration. </s>
<s>  then, shaking his head doubtingly, he turned, and led his own division of the party into the concealment of the forest. </s>
<s>  the route taken by duncan and david lay directly across the clearing of the beavers, and along the margin of their pond. </s>
<s>  when the former found himself alone with one so simple, and so little qualified to render any assistance in desperate emergencies, he first began to be sensible of the difficulties of the task he had undertaken. </s>
<s>  the fading light increased the gloominess of the bleak and savage wilderness that stretched so far on every side of him, and there was even a fearful character in the stillness of those little huts, that he knew were so abundantly peopled. </s>
<s>  it struck him, as he gazed at the admirable structures and the wonderful precautions of their sagacious inmates, that even the brutes of these vast wilds were possessed of an instinct nearly commensurate with his own reason. </s>
<s>  and he could not reflect, without anxiety, on the unequal contest that he had so rashly courted. </s>
<s>  then came the glowing image of alice. </s>
<s>  her distress. </s>
<s>  her actual danger. </s>
<s>  and all the peril of his situation was forgotten. </s>
<s>  cheering david, he moved on with the light and vigorous step of youth and enterprise. </s>
<s>  after making nearly a semicircle around the pond, they diverged from the water-course, and began to ascend to the level of a slight elevation in that bottom l over which they journeyed. </s>
<s>  within half an hour they gained the margin of another opening that bore all the signs of having been also made by the beavers, and which those sagacious animals had probably been induced, by some accident, to abandon, for the more eligible position they now occupied. </s>
<s>  a very natural sensation caused duncan to hesitate a moment, unwilling to leave the cover of their bushy path, as a man pauses to collect his energies before he essays any hazardous experiment, in which he is secretly conscious they will all be needed. </s>
<s>  he profited by the halt, to gather such information as might be obtained from his short and hasty glances. </s>
<s>  on the opposite side of the clearing, and near the point where the brook tumbled over some rocks, from a still higher level, some fifty or sixty lodges, rudely fabricated of logs brush, and earth intermingled, were to be discovered. </s>
<s>  they were arranged without any order, and seemed to be constructed with very little attention to neatness or beauty. </s>
<s>  indeed, so very inferior were they in the two latter particulars to the village duncan had just seen, that he began to expect a second surprise, no less astonishing that the former. </s>
<s>  this expectation was is no degree diminished, when, by the doubtful twilight, he beheld twenty or thirty forms rising alternately from the cover of the tall, coarse grass, in front of the lodges, and then sinking again from the sight, as it were to burrow in the earth. </s>
<s>  by the sudden and hasty glimpses that he caught of these figures, they seemed more like dark, glancing specters, or some other unearthly beings, than creatures fashioned with the ordinary and vulgar materials of flesh and blood. </s>
<s>  a gaunt, naked form was seen, for a single instant, tossing its arms wildly in the air, and then the spot it had filled was vacant. </s>
<s>  the figure appearing suddenly in some other and distant place, or being succeeded by another, possessing the same mysterious character. </s>
<s>  david, observing that his companion lingered, pursued the direction of his gaze, and in some measure recalled the recollection of heyward, by speaking. </s>
<s>  "there is much fruitful soil uncultivated here," he said. </s>
<s>  " i may add, without the sinful leaven of self- commendation, that, since my short sojourn in these heathenish abodes, much good seed has been scattered by the wayside. </s>
<s> " "the tribes are fonder of the chase than of the arts of men of labor," returned the unconscious duncan, still gazing at the objects of his wonder. </s>
<s>  "it is rather joy than labor to the spirit, to lift up the voice in praise. </s>
<s>  but sadly do these boys abuse their gifts. </s>
<s>  rarely have i found any of their age, on whom nature has so freely bestowed the elements of psalmody. </s>
<s>  and surely, surely, there are none who neglect them more. </s>
<s>  three nights have i now tarried here, and three several times have i assembled the urchins to join in sacred song. </s>
<s>  and as often have they responded to my efforts with whoopings and howlings that have chilled my soul!" "of whom speak you?" "of those children of the devil, who waste the precious moments in yonder idle antics. </s>
<s>  ah! the wholesome restraint of discipline is but little known among this self-abandoned people. </s>
<s>  in a country of birches, a rod is never seen, and it ought not to appear a marvel in my eyes, that the choicest blessings of providence are wasted in such cries as these. </s>
<s> " david closed his ears against the juvenile pack, whose yell just then rang shrilly through the forest. </s>
<s>  and duncan, suffering his lip to curl, as in mockery of his own superstition, said firmly: "we will proceed. </s>
<s> " without removing the safeguards form his ears, the master of song complied, and together they pursued their way toward what david was sometimes wont to call the "tents of the philistines. </s>
<s> " chapter 23 "but though the beast of game the privilege of chase may claim. </s>
<s>  though space and law the stag we lend ere hound we slip, or bow we bend. </s>
<s>  whoever recked, where, how, or when the prowling fox was trapped or slain?"--lady of the lake it is unusual to find an encampment of the natives, like those of the more instructed whites, guarded by the presence of armed men. </s>
<s>  well informed of the approach of every danger, while it is yet at a distance, the indian generally rests secure under his knowledge of the signs of the forest, and the long and difficult paths that separate him from those he has most reason to dread. </s>
<s>  but the enemy who, by any lucky concurrence of accidents, has found means to elude the vigilance of the scouts, will seldom meet with sentinels nearer home to sound the alarm. </s>
<s>  in addition to this general usage, the tribes friendly to the french knew too well the weight of the blow that had just been struck, to apprehend any immediate danger from the hostile nations that were tributary to the crown of britain. </s>
<s>  when duncan and david, therefore, found themselves in the center of the children, who played the antics already mentioned, it was without the least previous intimation of their approach. </s>
<s>  but so soon as they were observed the whole of the juvenile pack raised, by common consent, a shrill and warning whoop. </s>
<s>  and then sank, as it were, by magic, from before the sight of their visitors. </s>
<s>  the naked, tawny bodies of the crouching urchins blended so nicely at that hour, with the withered herbage, that at first it seemed as if the earth had, in truth, swallowed up their forms. </s>
<s>  though when surprise permitted duncan to bend his look more curiously about the spot, he found it everywhere met by dark, quick, and rolling eyeballs. </s>
<s>  gathering no encouragement from this startling presage of the nature of the scrutiny he was likely to undergo from the more mature judgments of the men, there was an instant when the young soldier would have retreated. </s>
<s>  it was, however, too late to appear to hesitate. </s>
<s>  the cry of the children had drawn a dozen warriors to the door of the nearest lodge, where they stood clustered in a dark and savage group, gravely awaiting the nearer approach of those who had unexpectedly come among them. </s>
<s>  david, in some measure familiarized to the scene, led the way with a steadiness that no slight obstacle was likely to disconcert, into this very building. </s>
<s>  it was the principal edifice of the village, though roughly constructed of the bark and branches of trees. </s>
<s>  being the lodge in which the tribe held its councils and public meetings during their temporary residence on the borders of the english province. </s>
<s>  duncan found it difficult to assume the necessary appearance of unconcern, as he brushed the dark and powerful frames of the savages who thronged its threshold. </s>
<s>   conscious that his existence depended on his presence of mind, he trusted to the discretion of his companion, whose footsteps he closely followed, endeavoring, as he proceeded, to rally his thoughts for the occasion. </s>
<s>  his blood curdled when he found himself in absolute contact with such fierce and implacable enemies. </s>
<s>  but he so far mastered his feelings as to pursue his way into the center of the lodge, with an exterior that did not betray the weakness. </s>
<s>  imitating the example of the deliberate gamut, he drew a bundle of fragrant brush from beneath a pile that filled the corner of the hut, and seated himself in silence. </s>
<s>  so soon as their visitor had passed, the observant warriors fell back from the entrance, and arranging themselves about him, they seemed patiently to await the moment when it might comport with the dignity of the stranger to speak. </s>
<s>  by far the greater number stood leaning, in lazy, lounging attitudes, against the upright posts that supported the crazy building, while three or four of the oldest and most distinguished of the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a little more in advance. </s>
<s>  a flaring torch was burning in the place, and set its red glare from face to face and figure to figure, as it waved in the currents of air. </s>
<s>  duncan profited by its light to read the probable character of his reception, in the countenances of his hosts. </s>
<s>  but his ingenuity availed him little, against the cold artifices of the people he had encountered. </s>
<s>  the chiefs in front scarce cast a glance at his person, keeping their eyes on the ground, with an air that might have been intended for respect, but which it was quite easy to construe into distrust. </s>
<s>  the men in the shadow were less reserved. </s>
<s>  duncan soon detected their searching, but stolen, looks which, in truth, scanned his person and attire inch by inch. </s>
<s>  leaving no emotion of the countenance, no gesture, no line of the paint, nor even the fashion of a garment, unheeded, and without comment. </s>
<s>  at length one whose hair was beginning to be sprinkled with gray, but whose sinewy limbs and firm tread announced that he was still equal to the duties of manhood, advanced out of the gloom of a corner, whither he had probably posted himself to make his observations unseen, and spoke. </s>
<s>  he used the language of the wyandots, or hurons. </s>
<s>  his words were, consequently, unintelligible to heyward, though they seemed, by the gestures that accompanied them, to be uttered more in courtesy than anger. </s>
<s>  the latter shook his head, and made a gesture indicative of his inability to reply. </s>
<s>  "do none of my brothers speak the french or the english?" he said, in the former language, looking about him from countenance to countenance, in hopes of finding a nod of assent. </s>
<s>  though more than one had turned, as if to catch the meaning of his words, they remained unanswered. </s>
<s>  "i should be grieved to think," continued duncan, speaking slowly, and using the simplest french of which he was the master, "to believe that none of this wise and brave nation understand the language that the'grand monarque' uses when he talks to his children. </s>
<s>  his heart would be heavy did he believe his red warriors paid him so little respect!" a long and grave pause succeeded, during which no movement of a limb, nor any expression of an eye, betrayed the expression produced by his remark. </s>
<s>  duncan, who knew that silence was a virtue among his hosts, gladly had recourse to the custom, in order to arrange his ideas. </s>
<s>  at length the same warrior who had before addressed him replied, by dryly demanding, in the language of the canadas: "when our great father speaks to his people, is it with the tongue of a huron?" "he knows no difference in his children, whether the color of the skin be red, or black, or white," returned duncan, evasively. </s>
<s>  "though chiefly is he satisfied with the brave hurons. </s>
<s> " "in what manner will he speak," demanded the wary chief, "when the runners count to him the scalps which five nights ago grew on the heads of the yengeese?" "they were his enemies," said duncan, shuddering involuntarily. </s>
<s>  "and doubtless, he will say, it is good. </s>
<s>  my hurons are very gallant. </s>
<s> " "our canada father does not think it. </s>
<s>  instead of looking forward to reward his indians, his eyes are turned backward. </s>
<s>  he sees the dead yengeese, but no huron. </s>
<s>  what can this mean?" "a great chief, like him, has more thoughts than tongues. </s>
<s>  he looks to see that no enemies are on his trail. </s>
<s> " "the canoe of a dead warrior will not float on the horican," returned the savage, gloomily. </s>
<s>  "his ears are open to the delawares, who are not our friends, and they fill them with lies. </s>
<s> " "it cannot be. </s>
<s>  see. </s>
<s>  he has bid me, who am a man that knows the art of healing, to go to his children, the red hurons of the great lakes, and ask if any are sick!" another silence succeeded this annunciation of the character duncan had assumed. </s>
<s>  every eye was simultaneously bent on his person, as if to inquire into the truth or falsehood of the declaration, with an intelligence and keenness that caused the subject of their scrutiny to tremble for the result. </s>
<s>  he was, however, relieved again by the former speaker. </s>
<s>  "do the cunning men of the canadas paint their skins?" the huron coldly continued. </s>
<s>  "we have heard them boast that their faces were pale. </s>
<s> " "when an indian chief comes among his white fathers," returned duncan, with great steadiness, "he lays aside his buffalo robe, to carry the shirt that is offered him. </s>
<s>  my brothers have given me paint and i wear it. </s>
<s> " a low murmur of applause announced that the compliment of the tribe was favorably received. </s>
<s>  the elderly chief made a gesture of commendation, which was answered by most of his companions, who each threw forth a hand and uttered a brief exclamation of pleasure. </s>
<s>  duncan began to breathe more freely, believing that the weight of his examination was past. </s>
<s>   as he had already prepared a simple and probable tale to support his pretended occupation, his hopes of ultimate success grew brighter. </s>
<s>  after a silence of a few moments, as if adjusting his thoughts, in order to make a suitable answer to the declaration their guests had just given, another warrior arose, and placed himself in an attitude to speak. </s>
<s>  while his lips were yet in the act of parting, a low but fearful sound arose from the forest, and was immediately succeeded by a high, shrill yell, that was drawn out, until it equaled the longest and most plaintive howl of the wolf. </s>
<s>  the sudden and terrible interruption caused duncan to start from his seat, unconscious of everything but the effect produced by so frightful a cry. </s>
<s>  at the same moment, the warriors glided in a body from the lodge, and the outer air was filled with loud shouts, that nearly drowned those awful sounds, which were still ringing beneath the arches of the woods. </s>
<s>  unable to command himself any longer, the youth broke from the place, and presently stood in the center of a disorderly throng, that included nearly everything having life, within the limits of the encampment. </s>
<s>  men, women, and children. </s>
<s>  the aged, the inform, the active, and the strong, were alike abroad, some exclaiming aloud, others clapping their hands with a joy that seemed frantic, and all expressing their savage pleasure in some unexpected event. </s>
<s>  though astounded, at first, by the uproar, heyward was soon enabled to find its solution by the scene that followed. </s>
<s>  there yet lingered sufficient light in the heavens to exhibit those bright openings among the tree-tops, where different paths left the clearing to enter the depths of the wilderness. </s>
<s>  beneath one of them, a line of warriors issued from the woods, and advanced slowly toward the dwellings. </s>
<s>  one in front bore a short pole, on which, as it afterwards appeared, were suspended several human scalps. </s>
<s>  the startling sounds that duncan had heard were what the whites have not inappropriately called the "death-hallo". </s>
<s>  and each repetition of the cry was intended to announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy. </s>
<s>  thus far the knowledge of heyward assisted him in the explanation. </s>
<s>  and as he now knew that the interruption was caused by the unlooked-for return of a successful war-party, every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward congratulation, for the opportune relief and insignificance it conferred on himself. </s>
<s>  when at the distance of a few hundred feet from the lodges the newly arrived warriors halted. </s>
<s>  their plaintive and terrific cry, which was intended to represent equally the wailings of the dead and the triumph to the victors, had entirely ceased. </s>
<s>  one of their number now called aloud, in words that were far from appalling, though not more intelligible to those for whose ears they were intended, than their expressive yells. </s>
<s>  it would be difficult to convey a suitable idea of the savage ecstasy with which the news thus imparted was received. </s>
<s>  the whole encampment, in a moment, became a scene of the most violent bustle and commotion. </s>
<s>  the warriors drew their knives, and flourishing them, they arranged themselves in two lines, forming a lane that extended from the war-party to the lodges. </s>
<s>  the squaws seized clubs, axes, or whatever weapon of offense first offered itself to their hands, and rushed eagerly to act their part in the cruel game that was at hand. </s>
<s>  even the children would not be excluded. </s>
<s>  but boys, little able to wield the instruments, tore the tomahawks from the belts of their fathers, and stole into the ranks, apt imitators of the savage traits exhibited by their parents. </s>
<s>  large piles of brush lay scattered about the clearing, and a wary and aged squaw was occupied in firing as many as might serve to light the coming exhibition. </s>
<s>  as the flame arose, its power exceeded that of the parting day, and assisted to render objects at the same time more distinct and more hideous. </s>
<s>  the whole scene formed a striking picture, whose frame was composed of the dark and tall border of pines. </s>
<s>  the warriors just arrived were the most distant figures. </s>
<s>  a little in advance stood two men, who were apparently selected from the rest, as the principal actors in what was to follow. </s>
<s>  the light was not strong enough to render their features distinct, though it was quite evident that they were governed by very different emotions. </s>
<s>  while one stood erect and firm, prepared to meet his fate like a hero, the other bowed his head, as if palsied by terror or stricken with shame. </s>
<s>  the high-spirited duncan felt a powerful impulse of admiration and pity toward the former, though no opportunity could offer to exhibit his generous emotions. </s>
<s>  he watched his slightest movement, however, with eager eyes. </s>
<s>   as he traced the fine outline of his admirably proportioned and active frame, he endeavored to persuade himself, that, if the powers of man, seconded by such noble resolution, could bear one harmless through so severe a trial, the youthful captive before him might hope for success in the hazardous race he was about to run. </s>
<s>  insensibly the young man drew nigher to the swarthy lines of the hurons, and scarcely breathed, so intense became his interest in the spectacle. </s>
<s>  just then the signal yell was given, and the momentary quiet which had preceded it was broken by a burst of cries, that far exceeded any before heard. </s>
<s>  the more abject of the two victims continued motionless. </s>
<s>  but the other bounded from the place at the cry, with the activity and swiftness of a deer. </s>
<s>  instead of rushing through the hostile lines, as had been expected, he just entered the dangerous defile, and before time was given for a single blow, turned short, and leaping the heads of a row of children, he gained at once the exterior and safer side of the formidable array. </s>
<s>  the artifice was answered by a hundred voices raised in imprecations. </s>
<s>  and the whole of the excited multitude broke from their order, and spread themselves about the place in wild confusion. </s>
<s>  a dozen blazing piles now shed their lurid brightness on the place, which resembled some unhallowed and supernatural arena, in which malicious demons had assembled to act their bloody and lawless rites. </s>
<s>  the forms in the background looked like unearthly beings, gliding before the eye, and cleaving the air with frantic and unmeaning gestures. </s>
<s>  while the savage passions of such as passed the flames were rendered fearfully distinct by the gleams that shot athwart their inflamed visages. </s>
<s>  it will easily be understood that, amid such a concourse of vindictive enemies, no breathing time was allowed the fugitive. </s>
<s>  there was a single moment when it seemed as if he would have reached the forest, but the whole body of his captors threw themselves before him, and drove him back into the center of his relentless persecutors. </s>
<s>  turning like a headed deer, he shot, with the swiftness of an arrow, through a pillar of forked flame, and passing the whole multitude harmless, he appeared on the opposite side of the clearing. </s>
<s>  here, too, he was met and turned by a few of the older and more subtle of the hurons. </s>
<s>  once more he tried the throng, as if seeking safety in its blindness, and then several moments succeeded, during which duncan believed the active and courageous young stranger was lost. </s>
<s>  nothing could be distinguished but a dark mass of human forms tossed and involved in inexplicable confusion. </s>
<s>  arms, gleaming knives, and formidable clubs, appeared above them, but the blows were evidently given at random. </s>
<s>  the awful effect was heightened by the piercing shrieks of the women and the fierce yells of the warriors. </s>
<s>  now and then duncan caught a glimpse of a light form cleaving the air in some desperate bound, and he rather hoped than believed that the captive yet retained the command of his astonishing powers of activity. </s>
<s>  suddenly the multitude rolled backward, and approached the spot where he himself stood. </s>
<s>  the heavy body in the rear pressed upon the women and children in front, and bore them to the earth. </s>
<s>  the stranger reappeared in the confusion. </s>
<s>  human power could not, however, much longer endure so severe a trial. </s>
<s>  of this the captive seemed conscious. </s>
<s>  profiting by the momentary opening, he darted from among the warriors, and made a desperate, and what seemed to duncan a final effort to gain the wood. </s>
<s>  as if aware that no danger was to be apprehended from the young soldier, the fugitive nearly brushed his person in his flight. </s>
<s>  a tall and powerful huron, who had husbanded his forces, pressed close upon his heels, and with an uplifted arm menaced a fatal blow. </s>
<s>  duncan thrust forth a foot, and the shock precipitated the eager savage headlong, many feet in advance of his intended victim. </s>
<s>  thought itself is not quicker than was the motion with which the latter profited by the advantage. </s>
<s>  he turned, gleamed like a meteor again before the eyes of duncan,  at the next moment, when the latter recovered his recollection, and gazed around in quest of the captive, he saw him quietly leaning against a small painted post, which stood before the door of the principal lodge. </s>
<s>  apprehensive that the part he had taken in the escape might prove fatal to himself, duncan left the place without delay. </s>
<s>  he followed the crowd, which drew nigh the lodges, gloomy and sullen, like any other multitude that had been disappointed in an execution. </s>
<s>  curiosity, or perhaps a better feeling, induced him to approach the stranger. </s>
<s>  he found him, standing with one arm cast about the protecting post, and breathing thick and hard, after his exertions, but disdaining to permit a single sign of suffering to escape. </s>
<s>  his person was now protected by immemorial and sacred usage, until the tribe in council had deliberated and determined on his fate. </s>
<s>  it was not difficult, however, to foretell the result, if any presage could be drawn from the feelings of those who crowded the place. </s>
<s>  there was no term of abuse known to the huron vocabulary that the disappointed women did not lavishly expend on the successful stranger. </s>
<s>  they flouted at his efforts, and told him, with bitter scoffs, that his feet were better than his hands. </s>
<s>  and that he merited wings, while he knew not the use of an arrow or a knife. </s>
<s>  to all this the captive made no reply. </s>
<s>  but was content to preserve an attitude in which dignity was singularly blended with disdain. </s>
<s>  exasperated as much by his composure as by his good-fortune, their words became unintelligible, and were succeeded by shrill, piercing yells. </s>
<s>  just then the crafty squaw, who had taken the necessary precaution to fire the piles, made her way through the throng, and cleared a place for herself in front of the captive. </s>
<s>  the squalid and withered person of this hag might well have obtained for her the character of possessing more than human cunning. </s>
<s>  throwing back her light vestment, she stretched forth her long, skinny arm, in derision, and using the language of the lenape, as more intelligible to the subject of her gibes, she commenced aloud: "look you, delaware," she said, snapping her fingers in his face. </s>
<s>  "your nation is a race of women, and the hoe is better fitted to your hands than the gun. </s>
<s>  your squaws are the mothers of deer. </s>
<s>  but if a bear, or a wildcat, or a serpent were born among you, ye would flee. </s>
<s>  the huron girls shall make you petticoats, and we will find you a husband. </s>
<s> " a burst of savage laughter succeeded this attack, during which the soft and musical merriment of the younger females strangely chimed with the cracked voice of their older and more malignant companion. </s>
<s>  but the stranger was superior to all their efforts. </s>
<s>  his head was immovable. </s>
<s>  nor did he betray the slightest consciousness that any were present, except when his haughty eye rolled toward the dusky forms of the warriors, who stalked in the background silent and sullen observers of the scene. </s>
<s>  infuriated at the self-command of the captive, the woman placed her arms akimbo. </s>
<s>   throwing herself into a posture of defiance, she broke out anew, in a torrent of words that no art of ours could commit successfully to paper. </s>
<s>  her breath was, however, expended in vain. </s>
<s>  for, although distinguished in her nation as a proficient in the art of abuse, she was permitted to work herself into such a fury as actually to foam at the mouth, without causing a muscle to vibrate in the motionless figure of the stranger. </s>
<s>  the effect of his indifference began to extend itself to the other spectators. </s>
<s>  and a youngster, who was just quitting the condition of a boy to enter the state of manhood, attempted to assist the termagant, by flourishing his tomahawk before their victim, and adding his empty boasts to the taunts of the women. </s>
<s>  then, indeed, the captive turned his face toward the light, and looked down on the stripling with an expression that was superior to contempt. </s>
<s>  at the next moment he resumed his quiet and reclining attitude against the post. </s>
<s>  but the change of posture had permitted duncan to exchange glances with the firm and piercing eyes of uncas. </s>
<s>  breathless with amazement, and heavily oppressed with the critical situation of his friend, heyward recoiled before the look, trembling lest its meaning might, in some unknown manner, hasten the prisoner's fate. </s>
<s>  there was not, however, any instant cause for such an apprehension. </s>
<s>  just then a warrior forced his way into the exasperated crowd. </s>
<s>  motioning the women and children aside with a stern gesture, he took uncas by the arm, and led him toward the door of the council-lodge. </s>
<s>  thither all the chiefs, and most of the distinguished warriors, followed. </s>
<s>  among whom the anxious heyward found means to enter without attracting any dangerous attention to himself. </s>
<s>  a few minutes were consumed in disposing of those present in a manner suitable to their rank and influence in the tribe. </s>
<s>  an order very similar to that adopted in the preceding interview was observed. </s>
<s>  the aged and superior chiefs occupying the area of the spacious apartment, within the powerful light of a glaring torch, while their juniors and inferiors were arranged in the background, presenting a dark outline of swarthy and marked visages. </s>
<s>  in the very center of the lodge, immediately under an opening that admitted the twinkling light of one or two stars, stood uncas, calm, elevated, and collected. </s>
<s>  his high and haughty carriage was not lost on his captors, who often bent their looks on his person, with eyes which, while they lost none of their inflexibility of purpose, plainly betrayed their admiration of the stranger's daring. </s>
<s>  the case was different with the individual whom duncan had observed to stand forth with his friend, previously to the desperate trial of speed. </s>
<s>  and who, instead of joining in the chase, had remained, throughout its turbulent uproar, like a cringing statue, expressive of shame and disgrace. </s>
<s>  though not a hand had been extended to greet him, nor yet an eye had condescended to watch his movements, he had also entered the lodge, as though impelled by a fate to whose decrees he submitted, seemingly, without a struggle. </s>
<s>  heyward profited by the first opportunity to gaze in his face, secretly apprehensive he might find the features of another acquaintance. </s>
<s>  but they proved to be those of a stranger,  what was still more inexplicable, of one who bore all the distinctive marks of a huron warrior. </s>
<s>  instead of mingling with his tribe, however, he sat apart, a solitary being in a multitude, his form shrinking into a crouching and abject attitude, as if anxious to fill as little space as possible. </s>
<s>  when each individual had taken his proper station, and silence reigned in the place, the gray-haired chief already introduced to the reader, spoke aloud, in the language of the lenni lenape. </s>
<s>  "delaware," he said, "though one of a nation of women, you have proved yourself a man. </s>
<s>  i would give you food. </s>
<s>  but he who eats with a huron should become his friend. </s>
<s>  rest in peace till the morning sun, when our last words shall be spoken. </s>
<s> " "seven nights, and as many summer days, have i fasted on the trail of the hurons," uncas coldly replied. </s>
<s>  "the children of the lenape know how to travel the path of the just without lingering to eat. </s>
<s> " "two of my young men are in pursuit of your companion," resumed the other, without appearing to regard the boast of his captive. </s>
<s>  "when they get back, then will our wise man say to you 'live' or 'die'. </s>
<s> " "has a huron no ears?" scornfully exclaimed uncas. </s>
<s>  "twice, since he has been your prisoner, has the delaware heard a gun that he knows. </s>
<s>  your young men will never come back!" a short and sullen pause succeeded this bold assertion. </s>
<s>  duncan, who understood the mohican to allude to the fatal rifle of the scout, bent forward in earnest observation of the effect it might produce on the conquerors. </s>
<s>  but the chief was content with simply retorting: "if the lenape are so skillful, why is one of their bravest warriors here?" "he followed in the steps of a flying coward, and fell into a snare. </s>
<s>  the cunning beaver may be caught. </s>
<s> " as uncas thus replied, he pointed with his finger toward the solitary huron, but without deigning to bestow any other notice on so unworthy an object. </s>
<s>  the words of the answer and the air of the speaker produced a strong sensation among his auditors. </s>
<s>  every eye rolled sullenly toward the individual indicated by the simple gesture, and a low, threatening murmur passed through the crowd. </s>
<s>  the ominous sounds reached the outer door, and the women and children pressing into the throng, no gap had been left, between shoulder and shoulder, that was not now filled with the dark lineaments of some eager and curious human countenance. </s>
<s>  in the meantime, the more aged chiefs, in the center, communed with each other in short and broken sentences. </s>
<s>  not a word was uttered that did not convey the meaning of the speaker, in the simplest and most energetic form. </s>
<s>  again, a long and deeply solemn pause took place. </s>
<s>  it was known, by all present, to be the brave precursor of a weighty and important judgment. </s>
<s>  they who composed the outer circle of faces were on tiptoe to gaze. </s>
<s>  and even the culprit for an instant forgot his shame in a deeper emotion, and exposed his abject features, in order to cast an anxious and troubled glance at the dark assemblage of chiefs. </s>
<s>  the silence was finally broken by the aged warrior so often named. </s>
<s>  he arose from the earth, and moving past the immovable form of uncas, placed himself in a dignified attitude before the offender. </s>
<s>  at that moment, the withered squaw already mentioned moved into the circle, in a slow, sidling sort of a dance, holding the torch, and muttering the indistinct words of what might have been a species of incantation. </s>
<s>  though her presence was altogether an intrusion, it was unheeded. </s>
<s>  approaching uncas, she held the blazing brand in such a manner as to cast its red glare on his person, and to expose the slightest emotion of his countenance. </s>
<s>  the mohican maintained his firm and haughty attitude. </s>
<s>  and his eyes, so far from deigning to meet her inquisitive look, dwelt steadily on the distance, as though it penetrated the obstacles which impeded the view and looked into futurity. </s>
<s>  satisfied with her examination, she left him, with a slight expression of pleasure, and proceeded to practise the same trying experiment on her delinquent countryman. </s>
<s>  the young huron was in his war paint, and very little of a finely molded form was concealed by his attire. </s>
<s>  the light rendered every limb and joint discernible, and duncan turned away in horror when he saw they were writhing in irrepressible agony. </s>
<s>  the woman was commencing a low and plaintive howl at the sad and shameful spectacle, when the chief put forth his hand and gently pushed her aside. </s>
<s>  "reed-that-bends," he said, addressing the young culprit by name, and in his proper language, "though the great spirit has made you pleasant to the eyes, it would have been better that you had not been born. </s>
<s>  your tongue is loud in the village, but in battle it is still. </s>
<s>  none of my young men strike the tomahawk deeper into the war- post--none of them so lightly on the yengeese. </s>
<s>  the enemy know the shape of your back, but they have never seen the color of your eyes. </s>
<s>  three times have they called on you to come, and as often did you forget to answer. </s>
<s>  your name will never be mentioned again in your tribe--it is already forgotten. </s>
<s> " as the chief slowly uttered these words, pausing impressively between each sentence, the culprit raised his face, in deference to the other's rank and years. </s>
<s>  shame, horror, and pride struggled in its lineaments. </s>
<s>  his eye, which was contracted with inward anguish, gleamed on the persons of those whose breath was his fame. </s>
<s>  and the latter emotion for an instant predominated. </s>
<s>  he arose to his feet, and baring his bosom, looked steadily on the keen, glittering knife, that was already upheld by his inexorable judge. </s>
<s>  as the weapon passed slowly into his heart he even smiled, as if in joy at having found death less dreadful than he had anticipated, and fell heavily on his face, at the feet of the rigid and unyielding form of uncas. </s>
<s>  the squaw gave a loud and plaintive yell, dashed the torch to the earth, and buried everything in darkness. </s>
<s>  the whole shuddering group of spectators glided from the lodge like troubled sprites. </s>
<s>  and duncan thought that he and the yet throbbing body of the victim of an indian judgment had now become its only tenants. </s>
<s>  chapter 24 "thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay dissolve the council, and their chief obey. </s>
<s> "--pope's iliad a single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken. </s>
<s>  a hand was laid, with a powerful pressure, on his arm, and the low voice of uncas muttered in his ear: "the hurons are dogs. </s>
<s>  the sight of a coward's blood can never make a warrior tremble. </s>
<s>  the 'gray head' and the sagamore are safe, and the rifle of hawkeye is not asleep. </s>
<s>  go--uncas and the 'open hand' are now strangers. </s>
<s>  it is enough. </s>
<s> " heyward would gladly have heard more, but a gentle push from his friend urged him toward the door, and admonished him of the danger that might attend the discovery of their intercourse. </s>
<s>  slowly and reluctantly yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the throng that hovered nigh. </s>
<s>  the dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and fro. </s>
<s>  and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the lodge, and exhibited the figure of uncas still maintaining its upright attitude near the dead body of the huron. </s>
<s>  a knot of warriors soon entered the place again, and reissuing, they bore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods. </s>
<s>  after this termination of the scene, duncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned and unnoticed, endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he incurred the risk he ran. </s>
<s>  in the present temper of the tribe it would have been easy to have fled and rejoined his companions, had such a wish crossed his mind. </s>
<s>   in addition to the never- ceasing anxiety on account of alice, a fresher though feebler interest in the fate of uncas assisted to chain him to the spot. </s>
<s>  he continued, therefore, to stray from hut to hut, looking into each only to encounter additional disappointment, until he had made the entire circuit of the village. </s>
<s>  abandoning a species of inquiry that proved so fruitless, he retraced his steps to the council-lodge, resolved to seek and question david, in order to put an end to his doubts. </s>
<s>  on reaching the building, which had proved alike the seat of judgment and the place of execution, the young man found that the excitement had already subsided. </s>
<s>  the warriors had reassembled, and were now calmly smoking, while they conversed gravely on the chief incidents of their recent expedition to the head of the horican. </s>
<s>  though the return of duncan was likely to remind them of his character, and the suspicious circumstances of his visit, it produced no visible sensation. </s>
<s>  so far, the terrible scene that had just occurred proved favorable to his views, and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage. </s>
<s>  without seeming to hesitate, he walked into the lodge, and took his seat with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts. </s>
<s>  a hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that, though uncas still remained where he had left him, david had not reappeared. </s>
<s>  no other restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young huron, who had placed himself at hand. </s>
<s>  though an armed warrior leaned against the post that formed one side of the narrow doorway. </s>
<s>  in every other respect, the captive seemed at liberty. </s>
<s>  still he was excluded from all participation in the discourse, and possessed much more of the air of some finely molded statue than a man having life and volition. </s>
<s>  heyward had too recently witnessed a frightful instance of the prompt punishments of the people into whose hands he had fallen to hazard an exposure by any officious boldness. </s>
<s>  he would greatly have preferred silence and meditation to speech, when a discovery of his real condition might prove so instantly fatal. </s>
<s>  unfortunately for this prudent resolution, his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed. </s>
<s>  he had not long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade, when another of the elder warriors, who spoke the french language, addressed him: "my canada father does not forget his children," said the chief. </s>
<s>  "i thank him. </s>
<s>  an evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men. </s>
<s>  can the cunning stranger frighten him away?" heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the indians, in the cases of such supposed visitations. </s>
<s>  he saw, at a glance, that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own ends. </s>
<s>  it would, therefore, have been difficult, just then to have uttered a proposal that would have given him more satisfaction. </s>
<s>  aware of the necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character, however, he repressed his feelings, and answered with suitable mystery: "spirits differ. </s>
<s>  some yield to the power of wisdom, while others are too strong. </s>
<s> " "my brother is a great medicine," said the cunning savage. </s>
<s>  "he will try?" a gesture of assent was the answer. </s>
<s>  the huron was content with the assurance,  resuming his pipe, he awaited the proper moment to move. </s>
<s>  the impatient heyward, inwardly execrating the cold customs of the savages, which required such sacrifices to appearance, was fain to assume an air of indifference, equal to that maintained by the chief, who was, in truth, a near relative of the afflicted woman. </s>
<s>  the minutes lingered, and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in empiricism, when the huron laid aside his pipe and drew his robe across his breast, as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid. </s>
<s>  just then, a warrior of powerful frame, darkened the door, and stalking silently among the attentive group, he seated himself on one end of the low pile of brush which sustained duncan. </s>
<s>  the latter cast an impatient look at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable horror when he found himself in actual contact with magua. </s>
<s>  the sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the departure of the huron. </s>
<s>  several pipes, that had been extinguished, were lighted again. </s>
<s>  while the newcomer, without speaking a word, drew his tomahawk from his girdle, and filling the bowl on its head began to inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle, with as much indifference as if he had not been absent two weary days on a long and toilsome hunt. </s>
<s>  ten minutes, which appeared so many ages to duncan, might have passed in this manner. </s>
<s>  and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a cloud of white smoke before any of them spoke. </s>
<s>  "welcome!" one at length uttered. </s>
<s>  "has my friend found the moose?" "the young men stagger under their burdens," returned magua. </s>
<s>  "let 'reed-that-bends' go on the hunting path. </s>
<s>  he will meet them. </s>
<s> " a deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name. </s>
<s>  each pipe dropped from the lips of its owner as though all had inhaled an impurity at the same instant. </s>
<s>  the smoke wreathed above their heads in little eddies, and curling in a spiral form it ascended swiftly through the opening in the roof of the lodge, leaving the place beneath clear of its fumes, and each dark visage distinctly visible. </s>
<s>  the looks of most of the warriors were riveted on the earth. </s>
<s>  though a few of the younger and less gifted of the party suffered their wild and glaring eyeballs to roll in the direction of a white-headed savage, who sat between two of the most venerated chiefs of the tribe. </s>
<s>  there was nothing in the air or attire of this indian that would seem to entitle him to such a distinction. </s>
<s>  the former was rather depressed, than remarkable for the bearing of the natives. </s>
<s>  and the latter was such as was commonly worn by the ordinary men of the nation. </s>
<s>  like most around him for more than a minute his look, too, was on the ground. </s>
<s>   trusting his eyes at length to steal a glance aside, he perceived that he was becoming an object of general attention. </s>
<s>  then he arose and lifted his voice in the general silence. </s>
<s>  "it was a lie," he said. </s>
<s>  "i had no son. </s>
<s>  he who was called by that name is forgotten. </s>
<s>  his blood was pale, and it came not from the veins of a huron. </s>
<s>  the wicked chippewas cheated my squaw. </s>
<s>  the great spirit has said, that the family of wiss-entush should end. </s>
<s>  he is happy who knows that the evil of his race dies with himself. </s>
<s>  i have done. </s>
<s> " the speaker, who was the father of the recreant young indian, looked round and about him, as if seeking commendation of his stoicism in the eyes of the auditors. </s>
<s>  but the stern customs of his people had made too severe an exaction of the feeble old man. </s>
<s>  the expression of his eye contradicted his figurative and boastful language, while every muscle in his wrinkled visage was working with anguish. </s>
<s>  standing a single minute to enjoy his bitter triumph, he turned away, as if sickening at the gaze of men,  veiling his face in his blanket, he walked from the lodge with the noiseless step of an indian seeking, in the privacy of his own abode, the sympathy of one like himself, aged, forlorn and childless. </s>
<s>  the indians, who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and defects in character, suffered him to depart in silence. </s>
<s>  then, with an elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society might profitably emulate, one of the chiefs drew the attention of the young men from the weakness they had just witnessed, by saying, in a cheerful voice, addressing himself in courtesy to magua, as the newest comer: "the delawares have been like bears after the honey pots, prowling around my village. </s>
<s>  but who has ever found a huron asleep?" the darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder was not blacker than the brow of magua as he exclaimed: "the delawares of the lakes!" "not so. </s>
<s>  they who wear the petticoats of squaws, on their own river. </s>
<s>  one of them has been passing the tribe. </s>
<s> " "did my young men take his scalp?" "his legs were good, though his arm is better for the hoe than the tomahawk," returned the other, pointing to the immovable form of uncas. </s>
<s>  instead of manifesting any womanish curiosity to feast his eyes with the sight of a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to hate, magua continued to smoke, with the meditative air that he usually maintained, when there was no immediate call on his cunning or his eloquence. </s>
<s>  although secretly amazed at the facts communicated by the speech of the aged father, he permitted himself to ask no questions, reserving his inquiries for a more suitable moment. </s>
<s>  it was only after a sufficient interval that he shook the ashes from his pipe, replaced the tomahawk, tightened his girdle, and arose, casting for the first time a glance in the direction of the prisoner, who stood a little behind him. </s>
<s>  the wary, though seemingly abstracted uncas, caught a glimpse of the movement, and turning suddenly to the light, their looks met. </s>
<s>  near a minute these two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another steadily in the eye, neither quailing in the least before the fierce gaze he encountered. </s>
<s>  the form of uncas dilated, and his nostrils opened like those of a tiger at bay. </s>
<s>  but so rigid and unyielding was his posture, that he might easily have been converted by the imagination into an exquisite and faultless representation of the warlike deity of his tribe. </s>
<s>  the lineaments of the quivering features of magua proved more ductile. </s>
<s>  his countenance gradually lost its character of defiance in an expression of ferocious joy, and heaving a breath from the very bottom of his chest, he pronounced aloud the formidable name of: "le cerf agile!" each warrior sprang upon his feet at the utterance of the well-known appellation, and there was a short period during which the stoical constancy of the natives was completely conquered by surprise. </s>
<s>  the hated and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice, carrying the sound even beyond the limits of the lodge. </s>
<s>  the women and children, who lingered around the entrance, took up the words in an echo, which was succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl. </s>
<s>  the latter was not yet ended, when the sensation among the men had entirely abated. </s>
<s>  each one in presence seated himself, as though ashamed of his precipitation. </s>
<s>  but it was many minutes before their meaning eyes ceased to roll toward their captive, in curious examination of a warrior who had so often proved his prowess on the best and proudest of their nation. </s>
<s>  uncas enjoyed his victory, but was content with merely exhibiting his triumph by a quiet smile--an emblem of scorn which belongs to all time and every nation. </s>
<s>  magua caught the expression, and raising his arm, he shook it at the captive, the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling with the trembling agitation of the limb, as, in a tone of vengeance, he exclaimed, in english: "mohican, you die!" "the healing waters will never bring the dead hurons to life," returned uncas, in the music of the delawares. </s>
<s>  "the tumbling river washes their bones. </s>
<s>  their men are squaws: their women owls. </s>
<s>  go! call together the huron dogs, that they may look upon a warrior, my nostrils are offended. </s>
<s>  they scent the blood of a coward. </s>
<s> " the latter allusion struck deep, and the injury rankled. </s>
<s>  many of the hurons understood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke, among which number was magua. </s>
<s>  this cunning savage beheld, and instantly profited by his advantage. </s>
<s>  dropping the light robe of skin from his shoulder, he stretched forth his arm, and commenced a burst of his dangerous and artful eloquence. </s>
<s>  however much his influence among his people had been impaired by his occasional and besetting weakness, as well as by his desertion of the tribe, his courage and his fame as an orator were undeniable. </s>
<s>  he never spoke without auditors, and rarely without making converts to his opinions. </s>
<s>  on the present occasion, his native powers were stimulated by the thirst of revenge. </s>
<s>  he again recounted the events of the attack on the island at glenn's, the death of his associates and the escape of their most formidable enemies. </s>
<s>  then he described the nature and position of the mount whither he had led such captives as had fallen into their hands. </s>
<s>  of his own bloody intentions toward the maidens, and of his baffled malice he made no mention, but passed rapidly on to the surprise of the party by "la longue carabine," and its fatal termination. </s>
<s>  here he paused, and looked about him, in affected veneration for the departed,  in truth, to note the effect of his opening narrative. </s>
<s>  as usual, every eye was riveted on his face. </s>
<s>  each dusky figure seemed a breathing statue, so motionless was the posture, so intense the attention of the individual. </s>
<s>  then magua dropped his voice which had hitherto been clear, strong and elevated, and touched upon the merits of the dead. </s>
<s>  no quality that was likely to command the sympathy of an indian escaped his notice. </s>
<s>  one had never been known to follow the chase in vain. </s>
<s>  another had been indefatigable on the trail of their enemies. </s>
<s>  this was brave, that generous. </s>
<s>  in short, he so managed his allusions, that in a nation which was composed of so few families, he contrived to strike every chord that might find, in its turn, some breast in which to vibrate. </s>
<s>  "are the bones of my young men," he concluded, "in the burial-place of the hurons? you know they are not. </s>
<s>  their spirits are gone toward the setting sun, and are already crossing the great waters, to the happy hunting-grounds. </s>
<s>  but they departed without food, without guns or knives, without moccasins, naked and poor as they were born. </s>
<s>  shall this be? are their souls to enter the land of the just like hungry iroquois or unmanly delawares, or shall they meet their friends with arms in their hands and robes on their backs? what will our fathers think the tribes of the wyandots have become? they will look on their children with a dark eye, and say, 'go! a chippewa has come hither with the name of a huron' brothers, we must not forget the dead. </s>
<s>  a red-skin never ceases to remember. </s>
<s>  we will load the back of this mohican until he staggers under our bounty, and dispatch him after my young men. </s>
<s>  they call to us for aid, though our ears are not open. </s>
<s>  they say, 'forget us not' when they see the spirit of this mohican toiling after them with his burden, they will know we are of that mind. </s>
<s>  then will they go on happy. </s>
<s>  and our children will say, 'so did our fathers to their friends, so must we do to them' what is a yengee? we have slain many, but the earth is still pale. </s>
<s>  a stain on the name of huron can only be hid by blood that comes from the veins of an indian. </s>
<s>  let this delaware die. </s>
<s> " the effect of such an harangue, delivered in the nervous language and with the emphatic manner of a huron orator, could scarcely be mistaken. </s>
<s>  magua had so artfully blended the natural sympathies with the religious superstition of his auditors, that their minds, already prepared by custom to sacrifice a victim to the manes of their countrymen, lost every vestige of humanity in a wish for revenge. </s>
<s>  one warrior in particular, a man of wild and ferocious mien, had been conspicuous for the attention he had given to the words of the speaker. </s>
<s>  his countenance had changed with each passing emotion, until it settled into a look of deadly malice. </s>
<s>  as magua ended he arose  uttering the yell of a demon, his polished little axe was seen glancing in the torchlight as he whirled it above his head. </s>
<s>  the motion and the cry were too sudden for words to interrupt his bloody intention. </s>
<s>  it appeared as if a bright gleam shot from his h which was crossed at the same moment by a dark and powerful line. </s>
<s>  the former was the tomahawk in its passage. </s>
<s>  the latter the arm that magua darted forward to divert its aim. </s>
<s>  the quick and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late. </s>
<s>  the keen weapon cut the war plume from the scalping tuft of uncas, and passed through the frail wall of the lodge as though it were hurled from some formidable engine. </s>
<s>  duncan had seen the threatening action, and sprang upon his feet, with a heart which, while it leaped into his throat, swelled with the most generous resolution in behalf of his friend. </s>
<s>  a glance told him that the blow had failed, and terror changed to admiration. </s>
<s>  uncas stood still, looking his enemy in the eye with features that seemed superior to emotion. </s>
<s>  marble could not be colder, calmer, or steadier than the countenance he put upon this sudden and vindictive attack. </s>
<s>  then, as if pitying a want of skill which had proved so fortunate to himself, he smiled, and muttered a few words of contempt in his own tongue. </s>
<s>  "no!" said magua, after satisfying himself of the safety of the captive. </s>
<s>  "the sun must shine on his shame. </s>
<s>  the squaws must see his flesh tremble, or our revenge will be like the play of boys. </s>
<s>  go! take him where there is silence. </s>
<s>  let us see if a delaware can sleep at night, and in the morning die. </s>
<s> " the young men whose duty it was to guard the prisoner instantly passed their ligaments of bark across his arms, and led him from the lodge, amid a profound and ominous silence. </s>
<s>  it was only as the figure of uncas stood in the opening of the door that his firm step hesitated. </s>
<s>  there he turned,  in the sweeping and haughty glance that he threw around the circle of his enemies, duncan caught a look which he was glad to construe into an expression that he was not entirely deserted by hope. </s>
<s>  magua was content with his success, or too much occupied with his secret purposes to push his inquiries any further. </s>
<s>  shaking his mantle, and folding it on his bosom, he also quitted the place, without pursuing a subject which might have proved so fatal to the individual at his elbow. </s>
<s>  notwithstanding his rising resentment, his natural firmness, and his anxiety on behalf of uncas, heyward felt sensibly relieved by the absence of so dangerous and so subtle a foe. </s>
<s>  the excitement produced by the speech gradually subsided. </s>
<s>  the warriors resumed their seats and clouds of smoke once more filled the lodge. </s>
<s>  for near half an hour, not a syllable was uttered, or scarcely a look cast aside. </s>
<s>  a grave and meditative silence being the ordinary succession to every scene of violence and commotion among these beings, who were alike so impetuous and yet so self-restrained. </s>
<s>  when the chief, who had solicited the aid of duncan, finished his pipe, he made a final and successful movement toward departing. </s>
<s>  a motion of a finger was the intimation he gave the supposed physician to follow. </s>
<s>  and passing through the clouds of smoke, duncad was glad, on more accounts than one, to be able at last to breathe the pure air of a cool and refreshing summer evening. </s>
<s>  instead of pursuing his way among those lodges where heyward had already made his unsuccessful search, his companion turned aside, and proceeded directly toward the base of an adjacent mountain, which overhung the temporary village. </s>
<s>  a thicket of brush skirted its foot, and it became necessary to proceed through a crooked and narrow path. </s>
<s>  the boys had resumed their sports in the clearing, and were enacting a mimic chase to the post among themselves. </s>
<s>  in order to render their games as like the reality as possible, one of the boldest of their number had conveyed a few brands into some piles of tree-tops that had hitherto escaped the burning. </s>
<s>  the blaze of one of these fires lighted the way of the chief and duncan, and gave a character of additional wildness to the rude scenery. </s>
<s>  at a little distance from a bald rock, and directly in its front, they entered a grassy opening, which they prepared to cross. </s>
<s>  just then fresh fuel was added to the fire, and a powerful light penetrated even to that distant spot. </s>
<s>  it fell upon the white surface of the mountain, and was reflected downward upon a dark and mysterious-looking being that arose, unexpectedly, in their path. </s>
<s>  the indian paused, as if doubtful whether to proceed, and permitted his companion to approach his side. </s>
<s>  a large black ball, which at first seemed stationary, now began to move in a manner that to the latter was inexplicable. </s>
<s>  again the fire brightened and its glare fell more distinctly on the object. </s>
<s>  then even duncan knew it, by its restless and sidling attitudes, which kept the upper part of its form in constant motion, while the animal itself appeared seated, to be a bear. </s>
<s>  though it growled loudly and fiercely, and there were instants when its glistening eyeballs might be seen, it gave no other indications of hostility. </s>
<s>  the huron, at least, seemed assured that the intentions of this singular intruder were peaceable, for after giving it an attentive examination, he quietly pursued his course. </s>
<s>  duncan, who knew that the animal was often domesticated among the indians, followed the example of his companion, believing that some favorite of the tribe had found its way into the thicket, in search of food. </s>
<s>  they passed it unmolested. </s>
<s>  though obliged to come nearly in contact with the monster, the huron, who had at first so warily determined the character of his strange visitor, was now content with proceeding without wasting a moment in further examination. </s>
<s>  but heyward was unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward, in salutary watchfulness against attacks in the rear. </s>
<s>  his uneasiness was in no degree diminished when he perceived the beast rolling along their path, and following their footsteps. </s>
<s>  he would have spoken, but the indian at that moment shoved aside a door of bark, and entered a cavern in the bosom of the mountain. </s>
<s>  profiting by so easy a method of retreat, duncan stepped after him, and was gladly closing the slight cover to the opening, when he felt it drawn from his hand by the beast, whose shaggy form immediately darkened the passage. </s>
<s>  they were now in a straight and long gallery, in a chasm of the rocks, where retreat without encountering the animal was impossible. </s>
<s>  making the best of the circumstances, the young man pressed forward, keeping as close as possible to his conductor. </s>
<s>  the bear growled frequently at his heels, and once or twice its enormous paws were laid on his person, as if disposed to prevent his further passage into the den. </s>
<s>  how long the nerves of heyward would have sustained him in this extraordinary situation, it might be difficult to decide, for, happily, he soon found relief. </s>
<s>  a glimmer of light had constantly been in their front, and they now arrived at the place whence it proceeded. </s>
<s>  a large cavity in the rock had been rudely fitted to answer the purposes of many apartments. </s>
<s>  the subdivisions were simple but ingenious, being composed of stone, sticks, and bark, intermingled. </s>
<s>  openings above admitted the light by day, and at night fires and torches supplied the place of the sun. </s>
<s>  hither the hurons had brought most of their valuables, especially those which more particularly pertained to the nation. </s>
<s>  and hither, as it now appeared, the sick woman, who was believed to be the victim of supernatural power, had been transported also, under an impression that her tormentor would find more difficulty in making his assaults through walls of stone than through the leafy coverings of the lodges. </s>
<s>  the apartment into which duncan and his guide first entered, had been exclusively devoted to her accommodation. </s>
<s>  the latter approached her bedside, which was surrounded by females, in the center of whom heyward was surprised to find his missing friend david. </s>
<s>  a single look was sufficient to apprise the pretended leech that the invalid was far beyond his powers of healing. </s>
<s>  she lay in a sort of paralysis, indifferent to the objects which crowded before her sight, and happily unconscious of suffering. </s>
<s>  heyward was far from regretting that his mummeries were to be performed on one who was much too ill to take an interest in their failure or success. </s>
<s>  the slight qualm of conscience which had been excited by the intended deception was instantly appeased, and he began to collect his thoughts, in order to enact his part with suitable spirit, when he found he was about to be anticipated in his skill by an attempt to prove the power of music. </s>
<s>  gamut, who had stood prepared to pour forth his spirit in song when the visitors entered, after delaying a moment, drew a strain from his pipe, and commenced a hymn that might have worked a miracle, had faith in is efficacy been of much avail. </s>
<s>  he was allowed to proceed to the close, the indians respecting his imaginary infirmity, and duncan too glad of the delay to hazard the slightest interruption. </s>
<s>  as the dying cadence of his strains was falling on the ears of the latter, he started aside at hearing them repeated behind him, in a voice half human and half sepulchral. </s>
<s>  looking around, he beheld the shaggy monster seated on end in a shadow of the cavern, where, while his restless body swung in the uneasy manner of the animal, it repeated, in a sort of low growl, sounds, if not words, which bore some slight resemblance to the melody of the singer. </s>
<s>  the effect of so strange an echo on david may better be imagined than described. </s>
<s>  his eyes opened as if he doubted their truth. </s>
<s>  and his voice became instantly mute in excess of wonder. </s>
<s>  a deep-laid scheme, of communicating some important intelligence to heyward, was driven from his recollection by an emotion which very nearly resembled fear, but which he was fain to believe was admiration. </s>
<s>  under its influence, he exclaimed aloud: "she expects you, and is at hand". </s>
<s>  and precipitately left the cavern. </s>
<s>  chapter 25 "snug. </s>
<s> --have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it to me, for i am slow of study. </s>
<s>  quince. </s>
<s> --you may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring. </s>
<s> "--midsummer night's dream there was a strange blending of the ridiculous with that which was solemn in this scene. </s>
<s>  the beast sill continued its rolling, and apparently untiring movements, though its ludicrous attempt to imitate the melody of david ceased the instant the latter abandoned the field. </s>
<s>  the words of gamut were, as has been seen, in his native tongue. </s>
<s>  and to duncan they seem pregnant with some hidden meaning, though nothing present assisted him in discovering the object of their allusion. </s>
<s>  a speedy end was, however, put to every conjecture on the subject, by the manner of the chief, who advanced to the bedside of the invalid, and beckoned away the whole group of female attendants that had clustered there to witness the skill of the stranger. </s>
<s>  he was implicitly, though reluctantly, obeyed. </s>
<s>  and when the low echo which rang along the hollow, natural gallery, from the distant closing door, had ceased, pointing toward his insensible daughter, he said: "now let my brother show his power. </s>
<s> " thus unequivocally called on to exercise the functions of his assumed character, heyward was apprehensive that the smallest delay might prove dangerous. </s>
<s>  endeavoring, then, to collect his ideas, he prepared to perform that species of incantation, and those uncouth rites, under which the indian conjurers are accustomed to conceal their ignorance and impotency. </s>
<s>  it is more than probable that, in the disordered state of his thoughts, he would soon have fallen into some suspicious, if not fatal, error had not his incipient attempts been interrupted by a fierce growl from the quadruped. </s>
<s>  three several times did he renew his efforts to proceed, and as often was he met by the same unaccountable opposition, each interruption seeming more savage and threatening than the preceding. </s>
<s>  "the cunning ones are jealous," said the huron. </s>
<s>  "i go brother, the woman is the wife of one of my bravest young men. </s>
<s>  deal justly by her. </s>
<s>  peace!" he added, beckoning to the discontented beast to be quiet. </s>
<s>  "i go. </s>
<s> " the chief was as good as his word, and duncan now found himself alone in that wild and desolate abode with the helpless invalid and the fierce and dangerous brute. </s>
<s>  the latter listened to the movements of the indian with that air of sagacity that a bear is known to possess, until another echo announced that he had also left the cavern, when it turned and came waddling up to duncan before whom it seated itself in its natural attitude, erect like a man. </s>
<s>  the youth looked anxiously about him for some weapon, with which he might make a resistance against the attack he now seriously expected. </s>
<s>  it seemed, however, as if the humor of the animal had suddenly changed. </s>
<s>  instead of continuing its discontented growls, or manifesting any further signs of anger, the whole of its shaggy body shook violently, as if agitated by some strange internal convulsion. </s>
<s>  the huge and unwieldy talons pawed stupidly about the grinning muzzle, and while heyward kept his eyes riveted on its movements with jealous watchfulness, the grim head fell on one side and in its place appeared the honest sturdy countenance of the scout, who was indulging from the bottom of his soul in his own peculiar expression of merriment. </s>
<s>  "hist!" said the wary woodsman, interrupting heyward's exclamation of surprise. </s>
<s>  "the varlets are about the place, and any sounds that are not natural to witchcraft would bring them back upon us in a body. </s>
<s> " "tell me the meaning of this masquerade. </s>
<s>  and why you have attempted so desperate an adventure?" "ah, reason and calculation are often outdone by accident," returned the scout. </s>
<s>  " as a story should always commence at the beginning, i will tell you the whole in order. </s>
<s>  after we parted i placed the commandant and the sagamore in an old beaver lodge, where they are safer from the hurons than they would be in the garrison of edward for your high north-west indians, not having as yet got the traders among them, continued to venerate the beaver. </s>
<s>  after which uncas and i pushed for the other encampment as was agreed. </s>
<s>  have you seen the lad?" "to my great grief! he is captive, and condemned to die at the rising of the sun. </s>
<s> " "i had misgivings that such would be his fate," resumed the scout, in a less confident and joyous tone. </s>
<s>  but soon regaining his naturally firm voice, he continued: "his bad fortune is the true reason of my being here, for it would never do to abandon such a boy to the hurons. </s>
<s>  a rare time the knaves would have of it, could they tie 'the bounding elk' and 'the long carabine', as they call me, to the same stake! though why they have given me such a name i never knew, there being as little likeness between the gifts of 'killdeer' and the performance of one of your real canada carabynes, as there is between the natur' of a pipe-stone and a flint. </s>
<s> " "keep to your tale," said the impatient heyward. </s>
<s>  "we know not at what moment the hurons may return. </s>
<s> " "no fear of them. </s>
<s>  a conjurer must have his time, like a straggling priest in the settlements. </s>
<s>  we are as safe from interruption as a missionary would be at the beginning of a two hours' discourse. </s>
<s>  well, uncas and i fell in with a return party of the varlets. </s>
<s>  the lad was much too forward for a scout. </s>
<s>  nay, for that matter, being of hot blood, he was not so much to blame. </s>
<s>   after all, one of the hurons proved a coward, and in fleeing led him into an ambushment. </s>
<s> " "and dearly has he paid for the weakness. </s>
<s> " the scout significantly passed his hand across his own throat, and nodded, as if he said, "i comprehend your meaning. </s>
<s> " after which he continued, in a more audible though scarcely more intelligible language: "after the loss of the boy i turned upon the hurons, as you may judge. </s>
<s>  there have been scrimmages atween one or two of their outlyers and myself. </s>
<s>  but that is neither here nor there. </s>
<s>  so, after i had shot the imps, i got in pretty nigh to the lodges without further commotion. </s>
<s>  then what should luck do in my favor but lead me to the very spot where one of the most famous conjurers of the tribe was dressing himself, as i well knew, for some great battle with satan-- though why should i call that luck, which it now seems was an especial ordering of providence. </s>
<s>  so a judgmatical rap over the head stiffened the lying impostor for a time, and leaving him a bit of walnut for his supper, to prevent an uproar, and stringing him up atween two saplings, i made free with his finery, and took the part of the bear on myself, in order that the operations might proceed. </s>
<s> " "and admirably did you enact the character. </s>
<s>  the animal itself might have been shamed by the representation. </s>
<s> " "lord, major," returned the flattered woodsman, "i should be but a poor scholar for one who has studied so long in the wilderness, did i not know how to set forth the movements of natur' of such a beast. </s>
<s>  had it been now a catamount, or even a full-size panther, i would have embellished a performance for you worth regarding. </s>
<s>  but it is no such marvelous feat to exhibit the feats of so dull a beast. </s>
<s>  though, for that matter, too, a bear may be overacted. </s>
<s>  yes, yes. </s>
<s>  it is not every imitator that knows natur' may be outdone easier than she is equaled. </s>
<s>  but all our work is yet before us. </s>
<s>  where is the gentle one?" "heaven knows. </s>
<s>  i have examined every lodge in the village, without discovering the slightest trace of her presence in the tribe. </s>
<s> " "you heard what the singer said, as he left us: 'she is at h and expects you'?" "i have been compelled to believe he alluded to this unhappy woman. </s>
<s> " "the simpleton was frightened, and blundered through his message. </s>
<s>  but he had a deeper meaning. </s>
<s>  here are walls enough to separate the hole settlement. </s>
<s>  a bear ought to climb. </s>
<s>  therefore will i take a look above them. </s>
<s>  there may be honey- pots hid in these rocks, and i am a beast, you know, that has a hankering for the sweets. </s>
<s> " the scout looked behind him, laughing at his own conceit, while he clambered up the partition, imitating, as he went, the clumsy motions of the beast he represented. </s>
<s>  but the instant the summit was gained he made a gesture for silence, and slid down with the utmost precipitation. </s>
<s>  "she is here," he whispered, "and by that door you will find her. </s>
<s>  i would have spoken a word of comfort to the afflicted soul. </s>
<s>  but the sight of such a monster might upset her reason. </s>
<s>  though for that matter, major, you are none of the most inviting yourself in your paint. </s>
<s> " duncan, who had already swung eagerly forward, drew instantly back on hearing these discouraging words. </s>
<s>  "am i, then, so very revolting?" he demanded, with an air of chagrin. </s>
<s>  "you might not startle a wolf, or turn the royal americans from a discharge. </s>
<s>  but i have seen the time when you had a better favored look. </s>
<s>  your streaked countenances are not ill- judged of by the squaws, but young women of white blood give the preference to their own color. </s>
<s>  see," he added, pointing to a place where the water trickled from a rock, forming a little crystal spring, before it found an issue through the adjacent crevices. </s>
<s>  "you may easily get rid of the sagamore's daub, and when you come back i will try my hand at a new embellishment. </s>
<s>  it's as common for a conjurer to alter his paint as for a buck in the settlements to change his finery. </s>
<s> " the deliberate woodsman had little occasion to hunt for arguments to enforce his advice. </s>
<s>  he was yet speaking when duncan availed himself of the water. </s>
<s>  in a moment every frightful or offensive mark was obliterated, and the youth appeared again in the lineaments with which he had been gifted by nature. </s>
<s>  thus prepared for an interview with his mistress, he took a hasty leave of his companion, and disappeared through the indicated passage. </s>
<s>  the scout witnessed his departure with complacency, nodding his head after him, and muttering his good wishes. </s>
<s>  after which he very coolly set about an examination of the state of the larder, among the hurons, the cavern, among other purposes, being used as a receptacle for the fruits of their hunts. </s>
<s>  duncan had no other guide than a distant glimmering light, which served, however, the office of a polar star to the lover. </s>
<s>  by its aid he was enabled to enter the haven of his hopes, which was merely another apartment of the cavern, that had been solely appropriated to the safekeeping of so important a prisoner as a daughter of the commandant of william henry. </s>
<s>  it was profusely strewed with the plunder of that unlucky fortress. </s>
<s>  in the midst of this confusion he found her he sought, pale, anxious and terrified, but lovely. </s>
<s>  david had prepared her for such a visit. </s>
<s>  "duncan!" she exclaimed, in a voice that seemed to tremble at the sounds created by itself. </s>
<s>  "alice!" he answered, leaping carelessly among trunks, boxes, arms, and furniture, until he stood at her side. </s>
<s>  "i knew that you would never desert me," she said, looking up with a momentary glow on her otherwise dejected countenance. </s>
<s>  "but you are alone! grateful as it is to be thus remembered, i could wish to think you are not entirely alone. </s>
<s> " duncan, observing that she trembled in a manner which betrayed her inability to st gently induced her to be seated, while he recounted those leading incidents which it has been our task to accord. </s>
<s>  alice listened with breathless interest. </s>
<s>  and though the young man touched lightly on the sorrows of the stricken father. </s>
<s>  taking care, however, not to wound the self-love of his auditor, the tears ran as freely down the cheeks of the daughter as though she had never wept before. </s>
<s>  the soothing tenderness of duncan, however, soon quieted the first burst of her emotions, and she then heard him to the close with undivided attention, if not with composure. </s>
<s>  "and now, alice," he added, "you will see how much is still expected of you. </s>
<s>  by the assistance of our experienced and invaluable friend, the scout, we may find our way from this savage people, but you will have to exert your utmost fortitude. </s>
<s>  remember that you fly to the arms of your venerable parent, and how much his happiness, as well as your own, depends on those exertions. </s>
<s> " "can i do otherwise for a father who has done so much for me?" "and for me, too," continued the youth, gently pressing the hand he held in both his own. </s>
<s>  the look of innocence and surprise which he received in return convinced duncan of the necessity of being more explicit. </s>
<s>  "this is neither the place nor the occasion to detain you with selfish wishes," he added. </s>
<s>  "but what heart loaded like mine would not wish to cast its burden? they say misery is the closest of all ties. </s>
<s>  our common suffering in your behalf left but little to be explained between your father and myself. </s>
<s> " " dearest cora, duncan. </s>
<s>  surely cora was not forgotten?" "not forgotten! no. </s>
<s>  regretted, as woman was seldom mourned before. </s>
<s>  your venerable father knew no difference between his children. </s>
<s>  but i--alice, you will not be offended when i say, that to me her worth was in a degree obscured--" "then you knew not the merit of my sister," said alice, withdrawing her hand. </s>
<s>  "of you she ever speaks as of one who is her dearest friend. </s>
<s> " "i would gladly believe her such," returned duncan, hastily. </s>
<s>  "i could wish her to be even more. </s>
<s>  but with you, alice, i have the permission of your father to aspire to a still nearer and dearer tie. </s>
<s> " alice trembled violently, and there was an instant during which she bent her face aside, yielding to the emotions common to her sex. </s>
<s>  but they quickly passed away, leaving her mistress of her deportment, if not of her affections. </s>
<s>  "heyward," she said, looking him full in the face with a touching expression of innocence and dependency, "give me the sacred presence and the holy sanction of that parent before you urge me further. </s>
<s> " "though more i should not, less i could not say," the youth was about to answer, when he was interrupted by a light tap on his shoulder. </s>
<s>  starting to his feet, he turned,  confronting the intruder, his looks fell on the dark form and malignant visage of magua. </s>
<s>  the deep guttural laugh of the savage sounded, at such a moment, to duncan, like the hellish taunt of a demon. </s>
<s>  had he pursued the sudden and fierce impulse of the instant, he would have cast himself on the huron, and committed their fortunes to the issue of a deadly struggle. </s>
<s>   without arms of any description, ignorant of what succor his subtle enemy could comm and charged with the safety of one who was just then dearer than ever to his heart, he no sooner entertained than he abandoned the desperate intention. </s>
<s>  "what is your purpose?" said alice, meekly folding her arms on her bosom, and struggling to conceal an agony of apprehension in behalf of heyward, in the usual cold and distant manner with which she received the visits of her captor. </s>
<s>  the exulting indian had resumed his austere countenance, though he drew warily back before the menacing glance of the young man's fiery eye. </s>
<s>  he regarded both his captives for a moment with a steady look, and then, stepping aside, he dropped a log of wood across a door different from that by which duncan had entered. </s>
<s>  the latter now comprehended the manner of his surprise,  believing himself irretrievably lost, he drew alice to his bosom, and stood prepared to meet a fate which he hardly regretted, since it was to be suffered in such company. </s>
<s>  but magua meditated no immediate violence. </s>
<s>  his first measures were very evidently taken to secure his new captive. </s>
<s>  nor did he even bestow a second glance at the motionless forms in the center of the cavern, until he had completely cut off every hope of retreat through the private outlet he had himself used. </s>
<s>  he was watched in all his movements by heyward, who, however, remained firm, still folding the fragile form of alice to his heart, at once too proud and too hopeless to ask favor of an enemy so often foiled. </s>
<s>  when magua had effected his object he approached his prisoners, and said in english: "the pale faces trap the cunning beavers. </s>
<s>  but the red-skins know how to take the yengeese. </s>
<s> " "huron, do your worst!" exclaimed the excited heyward, forgetful that a double stake was involved in his life. </s>
<s>  "you and your vengeance are alike despised. </s>
<s> " "will the white man speak these words at the stake?" asked magua. </s>
<s>  manifesting, at the same time, how little faith he had in the other's resolution by the sneer that accompanied his words. </s>
<s>  "here. </s>
<s>  singly to your face, or in the presence of your nation. </s>
<s> " "le renard subtil is a great chief!" returned the indian. </s>
<s>  "he will go and bring his young men, to see how bravely a pale face can laugh at tortures. </s>
<s> " he turned away while speaking, and was about to leave the place through the avenue by which duncan had approached, when a growl caught his ear, and caused him to hesitate. </s>
<s>  the figure of the bear appeared in the door, where it sat, rolling from side to side in its customary restlessness. </s>
<s>  magua, like the father of the sick woman, eyed it keenly for a moment, as if to ascertain its character. </s>
<s>  he was far above the more vulgar superstitions of his tribe, and so soon as he recognized the well-known attire of the conjurer, he prepared to pass it in cool contempt. </s>
<s>  but a louder and more threatening growl caused him again to pause. </s>
<s>  then he seemed as if suddenly resolved to trifle no longer, and moved resolutely forward. </s>
<s>  the mimic animal, which had advanced a little, retired slowly in his front, until it arrived again at the pass, when, rearing on his hinder legs, it beat the air with its paws, in the manner practised by its brutal prototype. </s>
<s>  "fool!" exclaimed the chief, in huron, "go play with the children and squaws. </s>
<s>  leave men to their wisdom. </s>
<s> " he once more endeavored to pass the supposed empiric, scorning even the parade of threatening to use the knife, or tomahawk, that was pendent from his belt. </s>
<s>  suddenly the beast extended its arms, or rather legs, and inclosed him in a grasp that might have vied with the far-famed power of the "bear's hug" itself. </s>
<s>  heyward had watched the whole procedure, on the part of hawkeye, with breathless interest. </s>
<s>  at first he relinquished his hold of alice. </s>
<s>  then he caught up a thong of buckskin, which had been used around some bundle, and when he beheld his enemy with his two arms pinned to his side by the iron muscles of the scout, he rushed upon him, and effectually secured them there. </s>
<s>  arms, legs, and feet were encircled in twenty folds of the thong, in less time than we have taken to record the circumstance. </s>
<s>  when the formidable huron was completely pinioned, the scout released his hold, and duncan laid his enemy on his back, utterly helpless. </s>
<s>  throughout the whole of this sudden and extraordinary operation, magua, though he had struggled violently, until assured he was in the hands of one whose nerves were far better strung than his own, had not uttered the slightest exclamation. </s>
<s>  but when hawkeye, by way of making a summary explanation of his conduct, removed the shaggy jaws of the beast, and exposed his own rugged and earnest countenance to the gaze of the huron, the philosophy of the latter was so far mastered as to permit him to utter the never failing: "hugh!" "ay, you've found your tongue," said his undisturbed conqueror. </s>
<s>  "now, in order that you shall not use it to our ruin, i must make free to stop your mouth. </s>
<s> " as there was no time to be lost, the scout immediately set about effecting so necessary a precaution. </s>
<s>  and when he had gagged the indian, his enemy might safely have been considered as "hors de combat. </s>
<s> " "by what place did the imp enter?" asked the industrious scout, when his work was ended. </s>
<s>  "not a soul has passed my way since you left me. </s>
<s> " duncan pointed out the door by which magua had come, and which now presented too many obstacles to a quick retreat. </s>
<s>  "bring on the gentle one, then," continued his friend. </s>
<s>  "we must make a push for the woods by the other outlet. </s>
<s> " "'tis impossible!" said duncan. </s>
<s>  "fear has overcome her, and she is helpless. </s>
<s>  alice! my sweet, my own alice, arouse yourself. </s>
<s>  now is the moment to fly. </s>
<s>  'tis in vain! she hears, but is unable to follow. </s>
<s>  go, noble and worthy friend. </s>
<s>  save yourself, and leave me to my fate. </s>
<s> " "every trail has its end, and every calamity brings its lesson!" returned the scout. </s>
<s>  "there, wrap her in them indian cloths. </s>
<s>  conceal all of her little form. </s>
<s>  nay, that foot has no fellow in the wilderness. </s>
<s>  it will betray her. </s>
<s>  all, every part. </s>
<s>  now take her in your arms, and follow. </s>
<s>  leave the rest to me. </s>
<s> " duncan, as may be gathered from the words of his companion, was eagerly obeying. </s>
<s>   as the other finished speaking, he took the light person of alice in his arms, and followed in the footsteps of the scout. </s>
<s>  they found the sick woman as they had left her, still alone, and passed swiftly on, by the natural gallery, to the place of entrance. </s>
<s>  as they approached the little door of bark, a murmur of voices without announced that the friends and relatives of the invalid were gathered about the place, patiently awaiting a summons to re-enter. </s>
<s>  "if i open my lips to speak," hawkeye whispered, "my english, which is the genuine tongue of a white-skin, will tell the varlets that an enemy is among them. </s>
<s>  you must give 'em your jargon, major. </s>
<s>  and say that we have shut the evil spirit in the cave, and are taking the woman to the woods in order to find strengthening roots. </s>
<s>  practise all your cunning, for it is a lawful undertaking. </s>
<s> " the door opened a little, as if one without was listening to the proceedings within, and compelled the scout to cease his directions. </s>
<s>  a fierce growl repelled the eavesdropper, and then the scout boldly threw open the covering of bark, and left the place, enacting the character of a bear as he proceeded. </s>
<s>  duncan kept close at his heels, and soon found himself in the center of a cluster of twenty anxious relatives and friends. </s>
<s>  the crowd fell back a little, and permitted the father, and one who appeared to be the husband of the woman, to approach. </s>
<s>  "has my brother driven away the evil spirit?" demanded the former. </s>
<s>  "what has he in his arms?" "thy child," returned duncan, gravely. </s>
<s>  "the disease has gone out of her. </s>
<s>  it is shut up in the rocks. </s>
<s>  i take the woman to a distance, where i will strengthen her against any further attacks. </s>
<s>  she will be in the wigwam of the young man when the sun comes again. </s>
<s> " when the father had translated the meaning of the stranger's words into the huron language, a suppressed murmur announced the satisfaction with which this intelligence was received. </s>
<s>  the chief himself waved his hand for duncan to proceed, saying aloud, in a firm voice, and with a lofty manner: "go. </s>
<s>  i am a man, and i will enter the rock and fight the wicked one. </s>
<s> " heyward had gladly obeyed, and was already past the little group, when these startling words arrested him. </s>
<s>  "is my brother mad?" he exclaimed. </s>
<s>  "is he cruel? he will meet the disease, and it will enter him. </s>
<s>  or he will drive out the disease, and it will chase his daughter into the woods. </s>
<s>  no. </s>
<s>  let my children wait without, and if the spirit appears beat him down with clubs. </s>
<s>  he is cunning, and will bury himself in the mountain, when he sees how many are ready to fight him. </s>
<s> " this singular warning had the desired effect. </s>
<s>  instead of entering the cavern, the father and husband drew their tomahawks, and posted themselves in readiness to deal their vengeance on the imaginary tormentor of their sick relative, while the women and children broke branches from the bushes, or seized fragments of the rock, with a similar intention. </s>
<s>  at this favorable moment the counterfeit conjurers disappeared. </s>
<s>  hawkeye, at the same time that he had presumed so far on the nature of the indian superstitions, was not ignorant that they were rather tolerated than relied on by the wisest of the chiefs. </s>
<s>  he well knew the value of time in the present emergency. </s>
<s>  whatever might be the extent of the self- delusion of his enemies, and however it had tended to assist his schemes, the slightest cause of suspicion, acting on the subtle nature of an indian, would be likely to prove fatal. </s>
<s>  taking the path, therefore, that was most likely to avoid observation, he rather skirted than entered the village. </s>
<s>  the warriors were still to be seen in the distance, by the fading light of the fires, stalking from lodge to lodge. </s>
<s>  but the children had abandoned their sports for their beds of skins, and the quiet of night was already beginning to prevail over the turbulence and excitement of so busy and important an evening. </s>
<s>  alice revived under the renovating influence of the open air,  as her physical rather than her mental powers had been the subject of weakness, she stood in no need of any explanation of that which had occurred. </s>
<s>  "now let me make an effort to walk," she said, when they had entered the forest, blushing, though unseen, that she had not been sooner able to quit the arms of duncan. </s>
<s>  "i am indeed restored. </s>
<s> " "nay, alice, you are yet too weak. </s>
<s> " the maiden struggled gently to release herself, and heyward was compelled to part with his precious burden. </s>
<s>  the representative of the bear had certainly been an entire stranger to the delicious emotions of the lover while his arms encircled his mistress. </s>
<s>  and he was, perhaps, a stranger also to the nature of that feeling of ingenuous shame that oppressed the trembling alice. </s>
<s>  but when he found himself at a suitable distance from the lodges he made a halt, and spoke on a subject of which he was thoroughly the master. </s>
<s>  "this path will lead you to the brook," he said. </s>
<s>  "follow its northern bank until you come to a fall. </s>
<s>  mount the hill on your right, and you will see the fires of the other people. </s>
<s>  there you must go and demand protection. </s>
<s>  if they are true delawares you will be safe. </s>
<s>  a distant flight with that gentle one, just now, is impossible. </s>
<s>  the hurons would follow up our trail, and master our scalps before we had got a dozen miles. </s>
<s>  go, and providence be with you. </s>
<s> " "and you!" demanded heyward, in surprise. </s>
<s>  "surely we part not here?" "the hurons hold the pride of the delawares. </s>
<s>  the last of the high blood of the mohicans is in their power," returned the scout. </s>
<s>  "i go to see what can be done in his favor. </s>
<s>  had they mastered your scalp, major, a knave should have fallen for every hair it held, as i promised. </s>
<s>  but if the young sagamore is to be led to the stake, the indians shall see also how a man without a cross can die. </s>
<s> " not in the least offended with the decided preference that the sturdy woodsman gave to one who might, in some degree, be called the child of his adoption, duncan still continued to urge such reasons against so desperate an effort as presented themselves. </s>
<s>  he was aided by alice, who mingled her entreaties with those of heyward that he would abandon a resolution that promised so much danger, with so little hope of success. </s>
<s>  their eloquence and ingenuity were expended in vain. </s>
<s>  the scout heard them attentively, but impatiently, and finally closed the discussion, by answering, in a tone that instantly silenced alice, while it told heyward how fruitless any further remonstrances would be. </s>
<s>  "i have heard," he said, "that there is a feeling in youth which binds man to woman closer than the father is tied to the son. </s>
<s>  it may be so. </s>
<s>  i have seldom been where women of my color dwell. </s>
<s>  but such may be the gifts of nature in the settlements. </s>
<s>  you have risked life, and all that is dear to you, to bring off this gentle one, and i suppose that some such disposition is at the bottom of it all. </s>
<s>  as for me, i taught the lad the real character of a rifle. </s>
<s>  and well has he paid me for it. </s>
<s>  i have fou't at his side in many a bloody scrimmage. </s>
<s>  and so long as i could hear the crack of his piece in one ear, and that of the sagamore in the other, i knew no enemy was on my back. </s>
<s>  winters and summer, nights and days, have we roved the wilderness in company, eating of the same dish, one sleeping while the other watched. </s>
<s>  and afore it shall be said that uncas was taken to the torment, and i at hand--there is but a single ruler of us all, whatever may the color of the skin. </s>
<s>  and him i call to witness, that before the mohican boy shall perish for the want of a friend, good faith shall depart the 'arth, and 'killdeer' become as harmless as the tooting we'pon of the singer!" duncan released his hold on the arm of the scout, who turned, and steadily retraced his steps toward the lodges. </s>
<s>  after pausing a moment to gaze at his retiring form, the successful and yet sorrowful heyward and alice took their way together toward the distant village of the delawares. </s>
<s>  chapter 26 "bot. </s>
<s> --let me play the lion too. </s>
<s> "--midsummer night's dream notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur. </s>
<s>  in his return to the camp, his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies, that he knew were, in no degree, inferior to his own. </s>
<s>  nothing but the color of his skin had saved the lives of magua and the conjurer, who would have been the first victims sacrificed to his own security, had not the scout believed such an act, however congenial it might be to the nature of an indian, utterly unworthy of one who boasted a descent from men that knew no cross of blood. </s>
<s>  accordingly, he trusted to the withes and ligaments with which he had bound his captives, and pursued his way directly toward the center of the lodges. </s>
<s>  as he approached the buildings, his steps become more deliberate, and his vigilant eye suffered no sign, whether friendly or hostile, to escape him. </s>
<s>  a neglected hut was a little in advance of the others, and appeared as if it had been deserted when half completed-- most probably on account of failing in some of the more important requisites. </s>
<s>  such as wood or water. </s>
<s>  a faint light glimmered through its cracks, however, and announced that, notwithstanding its imperfect structure, it was not without a tenant. </s>
<s>  thither, then, the scout proceeded, like a prudent general, who was about to feel the advanced positions of his enemy, before he hazarded the main attack. </s>
<s>  throwing himself into a suitable posture for the beast he represented, hawkeye crawled to a little opening, where he might command a view of the interior. </s>
<s>  it proved to be the abiding place of david gamut. </s>
<s>  hither the faithful singing- master had now brought himself, together with all his sorrows, his apprehensions, and his meek dependence on the protection of providence. </s>
<s>  at the precise moment when his ungainly person came under the observation of the scout, in the manner just mentioned, the woodsman himself, though in his assumed character, was the subject of the solitary being's profounded reflections. </s>
<s>  however implicit the faith of david was in the performance of ancient miracles, he eschewed the belief of any direct supernatural agency in the management of modern morality. </s>
<s>  in other words, while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam's ass to speak, he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear's singing. </s>
<s>  and yet he had been assured of the latter, on the testimony of his own exquisite organs. </s>
<s>  there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind. </s>
<s>  he was seated on a pile of brush, a few twigs from which occasionally fed his low fire, with his head leaning on his arm, in a posture of melancholy musing. </s>
<s>  the costume of the votary of music had undergone no other alteration from that so lately described, except that he had covered his bald head with the triangular beaver, which had not proved sufficiently alluring to excite the cupidity of any of his captors. </s>
<s>  the ingenious hawkeye, who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman, was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation. </s>
<s>  first making the circuit of the hut, and ascertaining that it stood quite alone, and that the character of its inmate was likely to protect it from visitors, he ventured through its low door, into the very presence of gamut. </s>
<s>  the position of the latter brought the fire between them. </s>
<s>  and when hawkeye had seated himself on end, near a minute elapsed, during which the two remained regarding each other without speaking. </s>
<s>  the suddenness and the nature of the surprise had nearly proved too much for--we will not say the philosophy--but for the pitch and resolution of david. </s>
<s>  he fumbled for his pitch- pipe, and arose with a confused intention of attempting a musical exorcism. </s>
<s>  "dark and mysterious monster!" he exclaimed, while with trembling hands he disposed of his auxiliary eyes, and sought his never-failing resource in trouble, the gifted version of the psalms. </s>
<s>  "i know not your nature nor intents. </s>
<s>  but if aught you meditate against the person and rights of one of the humblest servants of the temple, listen to the inspired language of the youth of israel, and repent. </s>
<s> " the bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well-known voice replied: "put up the tooting we'pon, and teach your throat modesty. </s>
<s>  five words of plain and comprehendible english are worth just now an hour of squalling. </s>
<s> " "what art thou?" demanded david, utterly disqualified to pursue his original intention, and nearly gasping for breath. </s>
<s>  "a man like yourself. </s>
<s>  and one whose blood is as little tainted by the cross of a bear, or an indian, as your own. </s>
<s>  have you so soon forgotten from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand?" "can these things be?" returned david, breathing more freely, as the truth began to dawn upon him. </s>
<s>  "i have found many marvels during my sojourn with the heathen, but surely nothing to excel this. </s>
<s> " "come, come," returned hawkeye, uncasing his honest countenance, the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion. </s>
<s>  "you may see a skin, which, if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones, has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed. </s>
<s>  now let us to business. </s>
<s> " "first tell me of the maiden, and of the youth who so bravely sought her," interrupted david. </s>
<s>  "ay, they are happily freed from the tomahawks of these varlets. </s>
<s>  but can you put me on the scent of uncas?" "the young man is in bondage, and much i fear his death is decreed. </s>
<s>  i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance, and i have sought a goodly hymn--" "can you lead me to him?" "the task will not be difficult," returned david, hesitating. </s>
<s>  "though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes. </s>
<s> " "no more words, but lead on," returned hawkeye, concealing his face again, and setting the example in his own person, by instantly quitting the lodge. </s>
<s>  as they proceeded, the scout ascertained that his companion found access to uncas, under privilege of his imaginary infirmity, aided by the favor he had acquired with one of the guards, who, in consequence of speaking a little english, had been selected by david as the subject of a religious conversion. </s>
<s>  how far the huron comprehended the intentions of his new friend may well be doubted. </s>
<s>  but as exclusive attention is as flattering to a savage as to a more civilized individual, it had produced the effect we have mentioned. </s>
<s>  it is unnecessary to repeat the shrewd manner with which the scout extracted these particulars from the simple david. </s>
<s>  neither shall we dwell in this place on the nature of the instruction he delivered, when completely master of all the necessary facts. </s>
<s>  as the whole will be sufficiently explained to the reader in the course of the narrative. </s>
<s>  the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village, and in a situation, perhaps, more difficult than any other to approach, or leave, without observation. </s>
<s>  but it was not the policy of hawkeye to affect the least concealment. </s>
<s>  presuming on his disguise, and his ability to sustain the character he had assumed, he took the most plain and direct route to the place. </s>
<s>  the hour, however, afforded him some little of that protection which he appeared so much to despise. </s>
<s>  the boys were already buried in sleep, and all the women, and most of the warriors, had retired to their lodges for the night. </s>
<s>  four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas, wary by close observers of the manner of their captive. </s>
<s>  at the sight of gamut, accompanied by one in the well-known masquerade of their most distinguished conjurer, they readily made way for them both. </s>
<s>  still they betrayed no intention to depart. </s>
<s>  on the other h they were evidently disposed to remain bound to the place by an additional interest in the mysterious mummeries that they of course expected from such a visit. </s>
<s>  from the total inability of the scout to address the hurons in their own language, he was compelled to trust the conversation entirely to david. </s>
<s>  notwithstanding the simplicity of the latter, he did ample justice to the instructions he had received, more than fulfilling the strongest hopes of his teacher. </s>
<s>  "the delawares are women!" he exclaimed, addressing himself to the savage who had a slight understanding of the language in which he spoke. </s>
<s>  "the yengeese, my foolish countrymen, have told them to take up the tomahawk, and strike their fathers in the canadas, and they have forgotten their sex. </s>
<s>  does my brother wish to hear 'le cerf agile' ask for his petticoats, and see him weep before the hurons, at the stake?" the exclamation "hugh!" delivered in a strong tone of assent, announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared. </s>
<s>  "then let him step aside, and the cunning man will blow upon the dog. </s>
<s>  tell it to my brothers. </s>
<s> " the huron explained the meaning of david to his fellows, who, in their turn, listened to the project with that sort of satisfaction that their untamed spirits might be expected to find in such a refinement in cruelty. </s>
<s>  they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter. </s>
<s>  but the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and growled: "the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers, and take away their courage too," continued david, improving the hint he received. </s>
<s>  "they must stand further off. </s>
<s> " the hurons, who would have deemed such a misfortune the heaviest calamity that could befall them, fell back in a body, taking a position where they were out of earshot, though at the same time they could command a view of the entrance to the lodge. </s>
<s>  then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position, and slowly entered the place. </s>
<s>  it was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire, which had been used for the purposed of cookery. </s>
<s>  uncas occupied a distant corner, in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound, both hands and feet, by strong and painful withes. </s>
<s>  when the frightful object first presented itself to the young mohican, he did not deign to bestow a single glance on the animal. </s>
<s>  the scout, who had left david at the door, to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy. </s>
<s>  instead of speaking, therefore, he exerted himself to enact one of the antics of the animal he represented. </s>
<s>  the young mohican, who at first believed his enemies had sent in a real beast to torment him, and try his nerves, detected in those performances that to heyward had appeared so accurate, certain blemishes, that at once betrayed the counterfeit. </s>
<s>  had hawkeye been aware of the low estimation in which the skillful uncas held his representations, he would probably have prolonged the entertainment a little in pique. </s>
<s>  but the scornful expression of the young man's eye admitted of so many constructions, that the worthy scout was spared the mortification of such a discovery. </s>
<s>  as soon, therefore, as david gave the preconcerted signal, a low hissing sound was heard in the lodge in place of the fierce growlings of the bear. </s>
<s>  uncas had cast his body back against the wall of the hut and closed his eyes, as if willing to exclude so contemptible and disagreeable an object from his sight. </s>
<s>  but the moment the noise of the serpent was heard, he arose, and cast his looks on each side of him, bending his head low, and turning it inquiringly in every direction, until his keen eye rested on the shaggy monster, where it remained riveted, as though fixed by the power of a charm. </s>
<s>  again the same sounds were repeated, evidently proceeding from the mouth of the beast. </s>
<s>  once more the eyes of the youth roamed over the interior of the lodge, and returning to the former resting place, he uttered, in a deep, suppressed voice: "hawkeye!" "cut his bands," said hawkeye to david, who just then approached them. </s>
<s>  the singer did as he was ordered, and uncas found his limbs released. </s>
<s>  at the same moment the dried skin of the animal rattled, and presently the scout arose to his feet, in proper person. </s>
<s>  the mohican appeared to comprehend the nature of the attempt his friend had made, intuitively, neither tongue nor feature betraying another symptom of surprise. </s>
<s>  when hawkeye had cast his shaggy vestment, which was done by simply loosing certain thongs of skin, he drew a long, glittering knife, and put it in the hands of uncas. </s>
<s>  "the red hurons are without," he said. </s>
<s>  "let us be ready. </s>
<s> " at the same time he laid his finger significantly on another similar weapon, both being the fruits of his prowess among their enemies during the evening. </s>
<s>  "we will go," said uncas. </s>
<s>  "whither?" "to the tortoises. </s>
<s>  they are the children of my grandfathers. </s>
<s> " "ay, lad," said the scout in english--a language he was apt to use when a little abstracted in mind. </s>
<s>  "the same blood runs in your veins, i believe. </s>
<s>  but time and distance has a little changed its color. </s>
<s>  what shall we do with the mingoes at the door? they count six, and this singer is as good as nothing. </s>
<s> " "the hurons are boasters," said uncas, scornfully. </s>
<s>  "their 'totem' is a moose, and they run like snails. </s>
<s>  the delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer. </s>
<s> " "ay, lad, there is truth in what you say. </s>
<s>  and i doubt not, on a rush, you would pass the whole nation. </s>
<s>   in a straight race of two miles, would be in, and get your breath again, afore a knave of them all was within hearing of the other village. </s>
<s>  but the gift of a white man lies more in his arms than in his legs. </s>
<s>  as for myself, i can brain a huron as well as a better man. </s>
<s>  but when it comes to a race the knaves would prove too much for me. </s>
<s> " uncas, who had already approached the door, in readiness to lead the way, now recoiled, and placed himself, once more, in the bottom of the lodge. </s>
<s>  but hawkeye, who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement, continued speaking more to himself than to his companion. </s>
<s>  "after all," he said, "it is unreasonable to keep one man in bondage to the gifts of another. </s>
<s>  so, uncas, you had better take the lead, while i will put on the skin again, and trust to cunning for want of speed. </s>
<s> " the young mohican made no reply, but quietly folded his arms, and leaned his body against one of the upright posts that supported the wall of the hut. </s>
<s>  "well," said the scout looking up at him, "why do you tarry? there will be time enough for me, as the knaves will give chase to you at first. </s>
<s> " "uncas will stay," was the calm reply. </s>
<s>  "for what?" "to fight with his father's brother, and die with the friend of the delawares. </s>
<s> " "ay, lad," returned hawkeye, squeezing the hand of uncas between his own iron fingers. </s>
<s>  "'twould have been more like a mingo than a mohican had you left me. </s>
<s>  but i thought i would make the offer, seeing that youth commonly loves life. </s>
<s>  well, what can't be done by main courage, in war, must be done by circumvention. </s>
<s>  put on the skin. </s>
<s>  i doubt not you can play the bear nearly as well as myself. </s>
<s> " whatever might have been the private opinion of uncas of their respective abilities in this particular, his grave countenance manifested no opinion of his superiority. </s>
<s>  he silently and expeditiously encased himself in the covering of the beast, and then awaited such other movements as his more aged companion saw fit to dictate. </s>
<s>  "now, friend," said hawkeye, addressing david, "an exchange of garments will be a great convenience to you, inasmuch as you are but little accustomed to the make-shifts of the wilderness. </s>
<s>  here, take my hunting shirt and cap, and give me your blanket and hat. </s>
<s>  you must trust me with the book and spectacles, as well as the tooter, too. </s>
<s>  if we ever meet again, in better times, you shall have all back again, with many thanks into the bargain. </s>
<s> " david parted with the several articles named with a readiness that would have done great credit to his liberality, had he not certainly profited, in many particulars, by the exchange. </s>
<s>  hawkeye was not long in assuming his borrowed garments. </s>
<s>  and when his restless eyes were hid behind the glasses, and his head was surmounted by the triangular beaver, as their statures were not dissimilar, he might readily have passed for the singer, by starlight. </s>
<s>  as soon as these dispositions were made, the scout turned to david, and gave him his parting instructions. </s>
<s>  "are you much given to cowardice?" he bluntly asked, by way of obtaining a suitable understanding of the whole case before he ventured a prescription. </s>
<s>  "my pursuits are peaceful, and my temper, i humbly trust, is greatly given to mercy and love," returned david, a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood. </s>
<s>  "but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord, even in the greatest straits. </s>
<s> " "your chiefest danger will be at the moment when the savages find out that they have been deceived. </s>
<s>  if you are not then knocked on the head, your being a non-composser will protect you. </s>
<s>  and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed. </s>
<s>  if you stay, it must be to sit down here in the shadow, and take the part of uncas, until such times as the cunning of the indians discover the cheat, when, as i have already said, your times of trial will come. </s>
<s>  so choose for yourself--to make a rush or tarry here. </s>
<s> " "even so," said david, firmly. </s>
<s>  "i will abide in the place of the delaware. </s>
<s>  bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf, and this, and more, will i dare in his service. </s>
<s> " "you have spoken as a man, and like one who, under wiser schooling, would have been brought to better things. </s>
<s>  hold your head down, and draw in your legs. </s>
<s>  their formation might tell the truth too early. </s>
<s>  keep silent as long as may be. </s>
<s>  and it would be wise, when you do speak, to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings, which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be. </s>
<s>  if however, they take your scalp, as i trust and believe they will not, depend on it, uncas and i will not forget the deed, but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends. </s>
<s> " "hold!" said david, perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him. </s>
<s>  "i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge. </s>
<s>  should i fall, therefore, seek no victims to my manes, but rather forgive my destroyers. </s>
<s>  and if you remember them at all, let it be in prayers for the enlightening of their minds, and for their eternal welfare. </s>
<s> " the scout hesitated, and appeared to muse. </s>
<s>  "there is a principle in that," he said, "different from the law of the woods. </s>
<s>  and yet it is fair and noble to reflect upon. </s>
<s> " then heaving a heavy sigh, probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned, he added: "it is what i would wish to practise myself, as one without a cross of blood, though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian. </s>
<s>  god bless you, friend. </s>
<s>  i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong, when the matter is duly considered, and keeping eternity before the eyes, though much depends on the natural gifts, and the force of temptation. </s>
<s> " so saying, the scout returned and shook david cordially by the hand. </s>
<s>  after which act of friendship he immediately left the lodge, attended by the new representative of the beast. </s>
<s>  the instant hawkeye found himself under the observation of the hurons, he drew up his tall form in the rigid manner of david, threw out his arm in the act of keeping time, and commenced what he intended for an imitation of his psalmody. </s>
<s>  happily for the success of this delicate adventure, he had to deal with ears but little practised in the concord of sweet sounds, or the miserable effort would infallibly have been detected. </s>
<s>  it was necessary to pass within a dangerous proximity of the dark group of the savages, and the voice of the scout grew louder as they drew nigher. </s>
<s>  when at the nearest point the huron who spoke the english thrust out an arm, and stopped the supposed singing-master. </s>
<s>  "the delaware dog!" he said, leaning forward, and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features. </s>
<s>  "is he afraid? will the hurons hear his groans?" a growl, so exceedingly fierce and natural, proceeded from the beast, that the young indian released his hold and started aside, as if to assure himself that it was not a veritable bear, and no counterfeit, that was rolling before him. </s>
<s>  hawkeye, who feared his voice would betray him to his subtle enemies, gladly profited by the interruption, to break out anew in such a burst of musical expression as would, probably, in a more refined state of society have been termed "a grand crash. </s>
<s> " among his actual auditors, however, it merely gave him an additional claim to that respect which they never withhold from such as are believed to be the subjects of mental alienation. </s>
<s>  the little knot on indians drew back in a body, and suffered, as they thought, the conjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed. </s>
<s>  it required no common exercise of fortitude in uncas and the scout to continue the dignified and deliberate pace they had assumed in passing the lodge. </s>
<s>  especially as they immediately perceived that curiosity had so far mastered fear, as to induce the watchers to approach the hut, in order to witness the effect of the incantations. </s>
<s>  the least injudicious or impatient movement on the part of david might betray them, and time was absolutely necessary to insure the safety of the scout. </s>
<s>  the loud noise the latter conceived it politic to continue, drew many curious gazers to the doors of the different huts as thy passed. </s>
<s>  and once or twice a dark- looking warrior stepped across their path, led to the act by superstition and watchfulness. </s>
<s>  they were not, however, interrupted, the darkness of the hour, and the boldness of the attempt, proving their principal friends. </s>
<s>  the adventurers had got clear of the village, and were now swiftly approaching the shelter of the woods, when a loud and long cry arose from the lodge where uncas had been confined. </s>
<s>  the mohican started on his feet, and shook his shaggy covering, as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort. </s>
<s>  "hold!" said the scout, grasping his friend by the shoulder, "let them yell again! 'twas nothing but wonderment. </s>
<s> " he had no occasion to delay, for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air, and ran along the whole extent of the village. </s>
<s>  uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions. </s>
<s>  hawkeye tapped him lightly on the shoulder, and glided ahead. </s>
<s>  "now let the devils strike our scent!" said the scout, tearing two rifles, with all their attendant accouterments, from beneath a bush, and flourishing "killdeer" as he handed uncas his weapon. </s>
<s>  "two, at least, will find it to their deaths. </s>
<s> " then, throwing their pieces to a low trail, like sportsmen in readiness for their game, they dashed forward, and were soon buried in the somber darkness of the forest. </s>
<s>  chapter 27 "ant. </s>
<s>  i shall remember: when c‘sar says do this, it is performed. </s>
<s> "--julius caesar the impatience of the savages who lingered about the prison of uncas, as has been seen, had overcome their dread of the conjurer's breath. </s>
<s>  they stole cautiously, and with beating hearts, to a crevice, through which the faint light of the fire was glimmering. </s>
<s>  for several minutes they mistook the form of david for that of the prisoner. </s>
<s>  but the very accident which hawkeye had foreseen occurred. </s>
<s>  tired of keeping the extremities of his long person so near together, the singer gradually suffered the lower limbs to extend themselves, until one of his misshapen feet actually came in contact with and shoved aside the embers of the fire. </s>
<s>  at first the hurons believed the delaware had been thus deformed by witchcraft. </s>
<s>  but when david, unconscious of being observed, turned his head, and exposed his simple, mild countenance, in place of the haughty lineaments of their prisoner, it would have exceeded the credulity of even a native to have doubted any longer. </s>
<s>  they rushed together into the lodge,  laying their hands, with but little ceremony, on their captive, immediately detected the imposition. </s>
<s>  they arose the cry first heard by the fugitives. </s>
<s>  it was succeeded by the most frantic and angry demonstrations of vengeance. </s>
<s>  david, however, firm in his determination to cover the retreat of his friends, was compelled to believe that his own final hour had come. </s>
<s>  deprived of his book and his pipe, he was fain to trust to a memory that rarely failed him on such subjects. </s>
<s>  and breaking forth in a loud and impassioned strain, he endeavored to smooth his passage into the other world by singing the opening verse of a funeral anthem. </s>
<s>  the indians were seasonably reminded of his infirmity,  rushing into the open air, they aroused the village in the manner described. </s>
<s>  a native warrior fights as he sleeps, without the protection of anything defensive. </s>
<s>  the sounds of the alarm were, therefore, hardly uttered before two hundred men were afoot, and ready for the battle or the chase, as either might be required. </s>
<s>  the escape was soon known. </s>
<s>  and the whole tribe crowded, in a body, around the council-lodge, impatiently awaiting the instruction of their chiefs. </s>
<s>  in such a sudden demand on their wisdom, the presence of the cunning magua could scarcely fail of being needed. </s>
<s>  his name was mentioned, and all looked round in wonder that he did not appear. </s>
<s>  messengers were then despatched to his lodge requiring his presence. </s>
<s>  in the meantime, some of the swiftest and most discreet of the young men were ordered to make the circuit of the clearing, under cover of the woods, in order to ascertain that their suspected neighbors, the delawares, designed no mischief. </s>
<s>  women and children ran to and fro. </s>
<s>   in short, the whole encampment exhibited another scene of wild and savage confusion. </s>
<s>  gradually, however, these symptoms of disorder diminished. </s>
<s>  and in a few minutes the oldest and most distinguished chiefs were assembled in the lodge, in grave consultation. </s>
<s>  the clamor of many voices soon announced that a party approached, who might be expected to communicate some intelligence that would explain the mystery of the novel surprise. </s>
<s>  the crowd without gave way, and several warriors entered the place, bringing with them the hapless conjurer, who had been left so long by the scout in duress. </s>
<s>  notwithstanding this man was held in very unequal estimation among the hurons, some believing implicitly in his power, and others deeming him an impostor, he was now listened to by all with the deepest attention. </s>
<s>  when his brief story was ended, the father of the sick woman stepped forth,  in a few pithy expression, related, in his turn, what he knew. </s>
<s>  these two narratives gave a proper direction to the subsequent inquiries, which were now made with the characteristic cunning of savages. </s>
<s>  instead of rushing in a confused and disorderly throng to the cavern, ten of the wisest and firmest among the chiefs were selected to prosecute the investigation. </s>
<s>  as no time was to be lost, the instant the choice was made the individuals appointed rose in a body and left the place without speaking. </s>
<s>  on reaching the entrance, the younger men in advance made way for their seniors. </s>
<s>  and the whole proceeded along the low, dark gallery, with the firmness of warriors ready to devote themselves to the public good, though, at the same time, secretly doubting the nature of the power with which they were about to contend. </s>
<s>  the outer apartment of the cavern was silent and gloomy. </s>
<s>  the woman lay in her usual place and posture, though there were those present who affirmed they had seen her borne to the woods by the supposed "medicine of the white men. </s>
<s> " such a direct and palpable contradiction of the tale related by the father caused all eyes to be turned on him. </s>
<s>  chafed by the silent imputation, and inwardly troubled by so unaccountable a circumstance, the chief advanced to the side of the bed,  stooping, cast an incredulous look at the features, as if distrusting their reality. </s>
<s>  his daughter was dead. </s>
<s>  the unerring feeling of nature for a moment prevailed and the old warrior hid his eyes in sorrow. </s>
<s>  then, recovering his self-possession, he faced his companions,  pointing toward the corpse, he said, in the language of his people: "the wife of my young man has left us! the great spirit is angry with his children. </s>
<s> " the mournful intelligence was received in solemn silence. </s>
<s>  after a short pause, one of the elder indians was about to speak, when a dark-looking object was seen rolling out of an adjoining apartment, into the very center of the room where they stood. </s>
<s>  ignorant of the nature of the beings they had to deal with, the whole party drew back a little,  rising on end, exhibited the distorted but still fierce and sullen features of magua. </s>
<s>  the discovery was succeeded by a general exclamation of amazement. </s>
<s>  as soon, however, as the true situation of the chief was understood, several knives appeared, and his limbs and tongue were quickly released. </s>
<s>  the huron arose, and shook himself like a lion quitting his lair. </s>
<s>  not a word escaped him, though his hand played convulsively with the handle of his knife, while his lowering eyes scanned the whole party, as if they sought an object suited to the first burst of his vengeance. </s>
<s>  it was happy for uncas and the scout, and even david, that they were all beyond the reach of his arm at such a moment. </s>
<s>  for, assuredly, no refinement in cruelty would then have deferred their deaths, in opposition to the promptings of the fierce temper that nearly choked him. </s>
<s>  meeting everywhere faces that he knew as friends, the savage grated his teeth together like rasps of iron, and swallowed his passion for want of a victim on whom to vent it. </s>
<s>  this exhibition of anger was noted by all present. </s>
<s>  and from an apprehension of exasperating a temper that was already chafed nearly to madness, several minutes were suffered to pass before another word was uttered. </s>
<s>  when, however, suitable time had elapsed, the oldest of the party spoke. </s>
<s>  "my friend has found an enemy," he said. </s>
<s>  "is he nigh that the hurons might take revenge?" "let the delaware die!" exclaimed magua, in a voice of thunder. </s>
<s>  another longer and expressive silence was observed, and was broken, as before, with due precaution, by the same individual. </s>
<s>  "the mohican is swift of foot, and leaps far," he said. </s>
<s>  "but my young men are on his trail. </s>
<s> " "is he gone?" demanded magua, in tones so deep and guttural, that they seemed to proceed from his inmost chest. </s>
<s>  "an evil spirit has been among us, and the delaware has blinded our eyes. </s>
<s> " "an evil spirit!" repeated the other, mockingly. </s>
<s>  "'tis the spirit that has taken the lives of so many hurons. </s>
<s>  the spirit that slew my young men at 'the tumbling river'. </s>
<s>  that took their scalps at the 'healing spring'. </s>
<s>  and who has, now, bound the arms of le renard subtil!" "of whom does my friend speak?" "of the dog who carries the heart and cunning of a huron under a pale skin--la longue carabine. </s>
<s> " the pronunciation of so terrible a name produced the usual effect among his auditors. </s>
<s>  but when time was given for reflection, and the warriors remembered that their formidable and daring enemy had even been in the bosom of their encampment, working injury, fearful rage took the place of wonder, and all those fierce passions with which the bosom of magua had just been struggling were suddenly transferred to his companions. </s>
<s>  some among them gnashed their teeth in anger, others vented their feelings in yells, and some, again, beat the air as frantically as if the object of their resentment were suffering under their blows. </s>
<s>  but this sudden outbreaking of temper as quickly subsided in the still and sullen restraint they most affected in their moments of inaction. </s>
<s>  magua, who had in his turn found leisure for reflection, now changed his manner, and assumed the air of one who knew how to think and act with a dignity worthy of so grave a subject. </s>
<s>  "let us go to my people," he said. </s>
<s>  "they wait for us. </s>
<s> " his companions consented in silence, and the whole of the savage party left the cavern and returned to the council- lodge. </s>
<s>  when they were seated, all eyes turned on magua, who understood, from such an indication, that, by common consent, they had devolved the duty of relating what had passed on him. </s>
<s>  he arose, and told his tale without duplicity or reservation. </s>
<s>  the whole deception practised by both duncan and hawkeye was, of course, laid naked, and no room was found, even for the most superstitious of the tribe, any longer to affix a doubt on the character of the occurrences. </s>
<s>  it was but too apparent that they had been insultingly, shamefully, disgracefully deceived. </s>
<s>  when he had ended, and resumed his seat, the collected tribe--for his auditors, in substance, included all the fighting men of the party--sat regarding each other like men astonished equally at the audacity and the success of their enemies. </s>
<s>  the next consideration, however, was the means and opportunities for revenge. </s>
<s>  additional pursuers were sent on the trail of the fugitives. </s>
<s>  and then the chiefs applied themselves, in earnest, to the business of consultation. </s>
<s>  many different expedients were proposed by the elder warriors, in succession, to all of which magua was a silent and respectful listener. </s>
<s>  that subtle savage had recovered his artifice and self-comm and now proceeded toward his object with his customary caution and skill. </s>
<s>  it was only when each one disposed to speak had uttered his sentiments, that he prepared to advance his own opinions. </s>
<s>  they were given with additional weight from the circumstance that some of the runners had already returned, and reported that their enemies had been traced so far as to leave no doubt of their having sought safety in the neighboring camp of their suspected allies, the delawares. </s>
<s>  with the advantage of possessing this important intelligence, the chief warily laid his plans before his fellows,  as might have been anticipated from his eloquence and cunning, they were adopted without a dissenting voice. </s>
<s>  they were, briefly, as follows, both in opinions and in motives. </s>
<s>  it has been already stated that, in obedience to a policy rarely departed from, the sisters were separated so soon as they reached the huron village. </s>
<s>  magua had early discovered that in retaining the person of alice, he possessed the most effectual check on cora. </s>
<s>  when they parted, therefore, he kept the former within reach of his h consigning the one he most valued to the keeping of their allies. </s>
<s>  the arrangement was understood to be merely temporary, and was made as much with a view to flatter his neighbors as in obedience to the invariable rule of indian policy. </s>
<s>  while goaded incessantly by these revengeful impulses that in a savage seldom slumber, the chief was still attentive to his more permanent personal interests. </s>
<s>  the follies and disloyalty committed in his youth were to be expiated by a long and painful penance, ere he could be restored to the full enjoyment of the confidence of his ancient people. </s>
<s>  and without confidence there could be no authority in an indian tribe. </s>
<s>  in this delicate and arduous situation, the crafty native had neglected no means of increasing his influence. </s>
<s>  and one of the happiest of his expedients had been the success with which he had cultivated the favor of their powerful and dangerous neighbors. </s>
<s>  the result of his experiment had answered all the expectations of his policy. </s>
<s>  for the hurons were in no degree exempt from that governing principle of nature, which induces man to value his gifts precisely in the degree that they are appreciated by others. </s>
<s>   while he was making this ostensible sacrifice to general considerations, magua never lost sight of his individual motives. </s>
<s>  the latter had been frustrated by the unlooked-for events which had placed all his prisoners beyond his control. </s>
<s>  and he now found himself reduced to the necessity of suing for favors to those whom it had so lately been his policy to oblige. </s>
<s>  several of the chiefs had proposed deep and treacherous schemes to surprise the delawares  by gaining possession of their camp, to recover their prisoners by the same blow. </s>
<s>  for all agreed that their honor, their interests, and the peace and happiness of their dead countrymen, imperiously required them speedily to immolate some victims to their revenge. </s>
<s>  but plans so dangerous to attempt, and of such doubtful issue, magua found little difficulty in defeating. </s>
<s>  he exposed their risk and fallacy with his usual skill. </s>
<s>  and it was only after he had removed every impediment, in the shape of opposing advice, that he ventured to propose his own projects. </s>
<s>  he commenced by flattering the self-love of his auditors. </s>
<s>  a never-failing method of commanding attention. </s>
<s>  when he had enumerated the many different occasions on which the hurons had exhibited their courage and prowess, in the punishment of insults, he digressed in a high encomium on the virtue of wisdom. </s>
<s>  he painted the quality as forming the great point of difference between the beaver and other brutes. </s>
<s>  between the brutes and men. </s>
<s>   finally, between the hurons, in particular, and the rest of the human race. </s>
<s>  after he had sufficiently extolled the property of discretion, he undertook to exhibit in what manner its use was applicable to the present situation of their tribe. </s>
<s>  on the one h he said, was their great pale father, the governor of the canadas, who had looked upon his children with a hard eye since their tomahawks had been so red. </s>
<s>  on the other, a people as numerous as themselves, who spoke a different language, possessed different interests, and loved them not, and who would be glad of any pretense to bring them in disgrace with the great white chief. </s>
<s>  then he spoke of their necessities. </s>
<s>  of the gifts they had a right to expect for their past services. </s>
<s>  of their distance from their proper hunting-grounds and native villages. </s>
<s>  and of the necessity of consulting prudence more, and inclination less, in so critical circumstances. </s>
<s>  when he perceived that, while the old men applauded his moderation, many of the fiercest and most distinguished of the warriors listened to these politic plans with lowering looks, he cunningly led them back to the subject which they most loved. </s>
<s>  he spoke openly of the fruits of their wisdom, which he boldly pronounced would be a complete and final triumph over their enemies. </s>
<s>  he even darkly hinted that their success might be extended, with proper caution, in such a manner as to include the destruction of all whom they had reason to hate. </s>
<s>  in short, he so blended the warlike with the artful, the obvious with the obscure, as to flatter the propensities of both parties, and to leave to each subject of hope, while neither could say it clearly comprehended his intentions. </s>
<s>  the orator, or the politician, who can produce such a state of things, is commonly popular with his contemporaries, however he may be treated by posterity. </s>
<s>  all perceived that more was meant than was uttered, and each one believed that the hidden meaning was precisely such as his own faculties enabled him to underst or his own wishes led him to anticipate. </s>
<s>  in this happy state of things, it is not surprising that the management of magua prevailed. </s>
<s>  the tribe consented to act with deliberation, and with one voice they committed the direction of the whole affair to the government of the chief who had suggested such wise and intelligible expedients. </s>
<s>  magua had now attained one great object of all his cunning and enterprise. </s>
<s>  the ground he had lost in the favor of his people was completely regained, and he found himself even placed at the head of affairs. </s>
<s>  he was, in truth, their ruler. </s>
<s>   so long as he could maintain his popularity, no monarch could be more despotic, especially while the tribe continued in a hostile country. </s>
<s>  throwing off, therefore, the appearance of consultation, he assumed the grave air of authority necessary to support the dignity of his office. </s>
<s>  runners were despatched for intelligence in different directions. </s>
<s>  spies were ordered to approach and feel the encampment of the delawares. </s>
<s>  the warriors were dismissed to their lodges, with an intimation that their services would soon be needed. </s>
<s>  and the women and children were ordered to retire, with a warning that it was their province to be silent. </s>
<s>  when these several arrangements were made, magua passed through the village, stopping here and there to pay a visit where he thought his presence might be flattering to the individual. </s>
<s>  he confirmed his friends in their confidence, fixed the wavering, and gratified all. </s>
<s>  then he sought his own lodge. </s>
<s>  the wife the huron chief had abandoned, when he was chased from among his people, was dead. </s>
<s>  children he had none. </s>
<s>  and he now occupied a hut, without companion of any sort. </s>
<s>  it was, in fact, the dilapidated and solitary structure in which david had been discovered, and whom he had tolerated in his presence, on those few occasions when they met, with the contemptuous indifference of a haughty superiority. </s>
<s>  hither, then, magua retired, when his labors of policy were ended. </s>
<s>  while others slept, however, he neither knew or sought repose. </s>
<s>  had there been one sufficiently curious to have watched the movements of the newly elected chief, he would have seen him seated in a corner of his lodge, musing on the subject of his future plans, from the hour of his retirement to the time he had appointed for the warriors to assemble again. </s>
<s>  occasionally the air breathed through the crevices of the hut, and the low flame that fluttered about the embers of the fire threw their wavering light on the person of the sullen recluse. </s>
<s>  at such moments it would not have been difficult to have fancied the dusky savage the prince of darkness brooding on his own fancied wrongs, and plotting evil. </s>
<s>  long before the day dawned, however, warrior after warrior entered the solitary hut of magua, until they had collected to the number of twenty. </s>
<s>  each bore his rifle, and all the other accouterments of war, though the paint was uniformly peaceful. </s>
<s>  the entrance of these fierce-looking beings was unnoticed: some seating themselves in the shadows of the place, and others standing like motionless statues, until the whole of the designated band was collected. </s>
<s>  then magua arose and gave the signal to proceed, marching himself in advance. </s>
<s>  they followed their leader singly, and in that well-known order which has obtained the distinguishing appellation of "indian file. </s>
<s> " unlike other men engaged in the spirit-stirring business of war, they stole from their camp unostentatiously and unobserved resembling a band of gliding specters, more than warriors seeking the bubble reputation by deeds of desperate daring. </s>
<s>  instead of taking the path which led directly toward the camp of the delawares, magua led his party for some distance down the windings of the stream, and along the little artificial lake of the beavers. </s>
<s>  the day began to dawn as they entered the clearing which had been formed by those sagacious and industrious animals. </s>
<s>  though magua, who had resumed his ancient garb, bore the outline of a fox on the dressed skin which formed his robe, there was one chief of his party who carried the beaver as his peculiar symbol, or "totem. </s>
<s> " there would have been a species of profanity in the omission, had this man passed so powerful a community of his fancied kindred, without bestowing some evidence of his regard. </s>
<s>  accordingly, he paused, and spoke in words as kind and friendly as if he were addressing more intelligent beings. </s>
<s>  he called the animals his cousins, and reminded them that his protecting influence was the reason they remained unharmed, while many avaricious traders were prompting the indians to take their lives. </s>
<s>  he promised a continuance of his favors, and admonished them to be grateful. </s>
<s>  after which, he spoke of the expedition in which he was himself engaged, and intimated, though with sufficient delicacy and circumlocution, the expediency of bestowing on their relative a portion of that wisdom for which they were so renowned. </s>
<s>   these harangues of the beasts were frequent among the indians. </s>
<s>  they often address their victims in this way, reproaching them for cowardice or commending their resolution, as they may happen to exhibit fortitude or the reverse, in suffering. </s>
<s>  during the utterance of this extraordinary address, the companions of the speaker were as grave and as attentive to his language as though they were all equally impressed with its propriety. </s>
<s>  once or twice black objects were seen rising to the surface of the water, and the huron expressed pleasure, conceiving that his words were not bestowed in vain. </s>
<s>  just as he ended his address, the head of a large beaver was thrust from the door of a lodge, whose earthen walls had been much injured, and which the party had believed, from its situation, to be uninhabited. </s>
<s>  such an extraordinary sign of confidence was received by the orator as a highly favorable omen. </s>
<s>  and though the animal retreated a little precipitately, he was lavish of his thanks and commendations. </s>
<s>  when magua thought sufficient time had been lost in gratifying the family affection of the warrior, he again made the signal to proceed. </s>
<s>  as the indians moved away in a body, and with a step that would have been inaudible to the ears of any common man, the same venerable-looking beaver once more ventured his head from its cover. </s>
<s>  had any of the hurons turned to look behind them, they would have seen the animal watching their movements with an interest and sagacity that might easily have been mistaken for reason. </s>
<s>  indeed, so very distinct and intelligible were the devices of the quadruped, that even the most experienced observer would have been at a loss to account for its actions, until the moment when the party entered the forest, when the whole would have been explained, by seeing the entire animal issue from the lodge, uncasing, by the act, the grave features of chingachgook from his mask of fur. </s>
<s>  chapter 28 "brief, i pray for you. </s>
<s>  for you see, 'tis a busy time with me. </s>
<s> "--much ado about nothing the tribe, or rather half tribe, of delawares, which has been so often mentioned, and whose present place of encampment was so nigh the temporary village of the hurons, could assemble about an equal number of warriors with the latter people. </s>
<s>  like their neighbors, they had followed montcalm into the territories of the english crown, and were making heavy and serious inroads on the hunting-grounds of the mohawks. </s>
<s>  though they had seen fit, with the mysterious reserve so common among the natives, to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most required. </s>
<s>  the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on the part of their ally in various ways. </s>
<s>  it was the prevalent opinion, however, that they had been influenced by veneration for the ancient treaty, that had once made them dependent on the six nations for military protection, and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their former masters. </s>
<s>  as for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce to montcalm, through his emissaries, with indian brevity, that their hatchets were dull, and time was necessary to sharpen them. </s>
<s>  the politic captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a passive friend, than by any acts of ill-judged severity to convert him into an open enemy. </s>
<s>  on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of the beavers into the forests, in the manner described, the sun rose upon the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people, actively employed in all the customary avocations of high noon. </s>
<s>  the women ran from lodge to lodge, some engaged in preparing their morning's meal, a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their habits, but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with their friends. </s>
<s>  the warriors were lounging in groups, musing more than they conversed and when a few words were uttered, speaking like men who deeply weighed their opinions. </s>
<s>  the instruments of the chase were to be seen in abundance among the lodges. </s>
<s>  but none departed. </s>
<s>  here and there a warrior was examining his arms, with an attention that is rarely bestowed on the implements, when no other enemy than the beasts of the forest is expected to be encountered. </s>
<s>  and occasionally, the eyes of a whole group were turned simultaneously toward a large and silent lodge in the center of the village, as if it contained the subject of their common thoughts. </s>
<s>  during the existence of this scene, a man suddenly appeared at the furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the village. </s>
<s>  he was without arms, and his paint tended rather to soften than increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance. </s>
<s>  when in full view of the delawares he stopped, and made a gesture of amity, by throwing his arm upward toward heaven, and then letting it fall impressively on his breast. </s>
<s>  the inhabitants of the village answered his salute by a low murmur of welcome, and encouraged him to advance by similar indications of friendship. </s>
<s>  fortified by these assurances, the dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace, where it had stood a moment, drawn in a strong outline against the blushing morning sky, and moved with dignity into the very center of the huts. </s>
<s>  as he approached, nothing was audible but the rattling of the light silver ornaments that loaded his arms and neck, and the tinkling of the little bells that fringed his deerskin moccasins. </s>
<s>  he made, as he advanced, many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed, neglecting to notice the women, however, like one who deemed their favor, in the present enterprise, of no importance. </s>
<s>  when he had reached the group in which it was evident, by the haughtiness of their common mien, that the principal chiefs were collected, the stranger paused, and then the delawares saw that the active and erect form that stood before them was that of the well-known huron chief, le renard subtil. </s>
<s>  his reception was grave, silent, and wary. </s>
<s>  the warriors in front stepped aside, opening the way to their most approved orator by the action. </s>
<s>  one who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern aborigines. </s>
<s>  "the wise huron is welcome," said the delaware, in the language of the maquas. </s>
<s>  "he is come to eat his 'succotash', with his brothers of the lakes. </s>
<s> "  a dish composed of cracked corn and beans. </s>
<s>  it is much used also by the whites. </s>
<s>  by corn is meant maise. </s>
<s>  "he is come," repeated magua, bending his head with the dignity of an eastern prince. </s>
<s>  the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist, they once more exchanged friendly salutations. </s>
<s>  then the delaware invited his guest to enter his own lodge, and share his morning meal. </s>
<s>  the invitation was accepted. </s>
<s>  and the two warriors, attended by three or four of the old men, walked calmly away, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit, and yet not betraying the least impatience by sign or word. </s>
<s>  during the short and frugal repast that followed, the conversation was extremely circumspect, and related entirely to the events of the hunt, in which magua had so lately been engaged. </s>
<s>  it would have been impossible for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of considering the visit as a thing of course, than did his hosts, notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware that it must be connected with some secret object and that probably of importance to themselves. </s>
<s>  when the appetites of the whole were appeased, the squaws removed the trenchers and gourds, and the two parties began to prepare themselves for a subtle trial of their wits. </s>
<s>  "is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron children?" demanded the orator of the delawares. </s>
<s>  "when was it ever otherwise?" returned magua. </s>
<s>  "he calls my people 'most beloved'. </s>
<s> " the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false, and continued: "the tomahawks of your young men have been very red. </s>
<s> " "it is so. </s>
<s>  but they are now bright and dull. </s>
<s>  for the yengeese are dead, and the delawares are our neighbors. </s>
<s> " the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the h and remained silent. </s>
<s>  then magua, as if recalled to such a recollection, by the allusion to the massacre, demanded: "does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers?" "she is welcome. </s>
<s> " "the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open. </s>
<s>  let her be sent to my squaws, if she gives trouble to my brother. </s>
<s> " "she is welcome," returned the chief of the latter nation, still more emphatically. </s>
<s>  the baffled magua continued silent several minutes, apparently indifferent, however, to the repulse he had received in this his opening effort to regain possession of cora. </s>
<s>  "do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their hunts?" he at length continued. </s>
<s>  "the lenape are rulers of their own hills," returned the other a little haughtily. </s>
<s>  "it is well. </s>
<s>  justice is the master of a red-skin. </s>
<s>  why should they brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other? are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of flowers?" "good!" exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time. </s>
<s>  magua waited a little, to permit his words to soften the feelings of the delawares, before he added: "have there not been strange moccasins in the woods? have not my brothers scented the feet of white men?" "let my canada father come," returned the other, evasively. </s>
<s>  "his children are ready to see him. </s>
<s> " "when the great chief comes, it is to smoke with the indians in their wigwams. </s>
<s>  the hurons say, too, he is welcome. </s>
<s>  but the yengeese have long arms, and legs that never tire! my young men dreamed they had seen the trail of the yengeese nigh the village of the delawares!" "they will not find the lenape asleep. </s>
<s> " "it is well. </s>
<s>  the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy," said magua, once more shifting his ground, when he found himself unable to penetrate the caution of his companion. </s>
<s>  "i have brought gifts to my brother. </s>
<s>  his nation would not go on the warpath, because they did not think it well, but their friends have remembered where they lived. </s>
<s> " when he had thus announced his liberal intention, the crafty chief arose, and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his hosts. </s>
<s>  they consisted principally of trinkets of little value, plundered from the slaughtered females of william henry. </s>
<s>  in the division of the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their selection. </s>
<s>  while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most distinguished warriors, one of whom was his host, he seasoned his offerings to their inferiors with such well- timed and apposite compliments, as left them no ground of complaint. </s>
<s>  in short, the whole ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the flattering, that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read the effect of a generosity so aptly mingled with praise, in the eyes of those he addressed. </s>
<s>  this well-judged and politic stroke on the part of magua was not without instantaneous results. </s>
<s>  the delawares lost their gravity in a much more cordial expression. </s>
<s>  and the host, in particular, after contemplating his own liberal share of the spoil for some moments with peculiar gratification, repeated with strong emphasis, the words: "my brother is a wise chief. </s>
<s>  he is welcome. </s>
<s> " "the hurons love their friends the delawares," returned magua. </s>
<s>  "why should they not? they are colored by the same sun, and their just men will hunt in the same grounds after death. </s>
<s>  the red-skins should be friends, and look with open eyes on the white men. </s>
<s>  has not my brother scented spies in the woods?" the delaware, whose name in english signified "hard heart," an appellation that the french had translated into "le coeur- dur," forgot that obduracy of purpose, which had probably obtained him so significant a title. </s>
<s>  his countenance grew very sensibly less stern and he now deigned to answer more directly. </s>
<s>  "there have been strange moccasins about my camp. </s>
<s>  they have been tracked into my lodges. </s>
<s> " "did my brother beat out the dogs?" asked magua, without adverting in any manner to the former equivocation of the chief. </s>
<s>  "it would not do. </s>
<s>  the stranger is always welcome to the children of the lenape. </s>
<s> " "the stranger, but not the spy. </s>
<s> " "would the yengeese send their women as spies? did not the huron chief say he took women in the battle?" "he told no lie. </s>
<s>  the yengeese have sent out their scouts. </s>
<s>  they have been in my wigwams, but they found there no one to say welcome. </s>
<s>  then they fled to the delawares--for, say they, the delawares are our friends. </s>
<s>  their minds are turned from their canada father!" this insinuation was a home thrust, and one that in a more advanced state of society would have entitled magua to the reputation of a skillful diplomatist. </s>
<s>  the recent defection of the tribe had, as they well knew themselves, subjected the delawares to much reproach among their french allies. </s>
<s>  and they were now made to feel that their future actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust. </s>
<s>  there was no deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee that such a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their future movements. </s>
<s>  their distant villages, their hunting-grounds and hundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of their physical force, were actually within the limits of the french territory. </s>
<s>  accordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as magua intended, with manifest disapprobation, if not with alarm. </s>
<s>  "let my father look in my face," said le coeur-dur. </s>
<s>  "he will see no change. </s>
<s>  it is true, my young men did not go out on the war-path. </s>
<s>  they had dreams for not doing so. </s>
<s>  but they love and venerate the great white chief. </s>
<s> " "will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the camp of his children? when he is told a bloody yengee smokes at your fire? that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in and out among the delawares? go! my great canada father is not a fool!" "where is the yengee that the delawares fear?" returned the other. </s>
<s>  "who has slain my young men? who is the mortal enemy of my great father?" "la longue carabine!" the delaware warriors started at the well-known name, betraying by their amazement, that they now learned, for the first time, one so famous among the indian allies of france was within their power. </s>
<s>  "what does my brother mean?" demanded le coeur-dur, in a tone that, by its wonder, far exceeded the usual apathy of his race. </s>
<s>  "a huron never lies!" returned magua, coldly, leaning his head against the side of the lodge, and drawing his slight robe across his tawny breast. </s>
<s>  "let the delawares count their prisoners. </s>
<s>  they will find one whose skin is neither red nor pale. </s>
<s> " a long and musing pause succeeded. </s>
<s>  the chief consulted apart with his companions, and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the most distinguished men of the tribe. </s>
<s>  as warrior after warrior dropped in, they were each made acquainted, in turn, with the important intelligence that magua had just communicated. </s>
<s>  the air of surprise, and the usual low, deep, guttural exclamation, were common to them all. </s>
<s>  the news spread from mouth to mouth, until the whole encampment became powerfully agitated. </s>
<s>  the women suspended their labors, to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the consulting warriors. </s>
<s>  the boys deserted their sports, and walking fearlessly among their fathers, looked up in curious admiration, as they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the temerity of their hated foe. </s>
<s>  in short, every occupation was abandoned for the time, and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the tribe might freely indulge, after their own peculiar manner, in an open expression of feeling. </s>
<s>  when the excitement had a little abated, the old men disposed themselves seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their tribe to perform, under circumstances of so much delicacy and embarrassment. </s>
<s>  during all these movements, and in the midst of the general commotion, magua had not only maintained his seat, but the very attitude he had originally taken, against the side of the lodge, where he continued as immovable,  apparently, as unconcerned, as if he had no interest in the result. </s>
<s>  not a single indication of the future intentions of his hosts, however, escaped his vigilant eyes. </s>
<s>  with his consummate knowledge of the nature of the people with whom he had to deal, he anticipated every measure on which they decided. </s>
<s>  and it might almost be said, that, in many instances, he knew their intentions, even before they became known to themselves. </s>
<s>  the council of the delawares was short. </s>
<s>  when it was ended, a general bustle announced that it was to be immediately succeeded by a solemn and formal assemblage of the nation. </s>
<s>  as such meetings were rare, and only called on occasions of the last importance, the subtle huron, who still sat apart, a wily and dark observer of the proceedings, now knew that all his projects must be brought to their final issue. </s>
<s>  he, therefore, left the lodge and walked silently forth to the place, in front of the encampment, whither the warriors were already beginning to collect. </s>
<s>  it might have been half an hour before each individual, including even the women and children, was in his place. </s>
<s>  the delay had been created by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and unusual a conference. </s>
<s>  but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops of that mountain, against whose bosom the delawares had constructed their encampment, most were seated. </s>
<s>  and as his bright rays darted from behind the outline of trees that fringed the eminence, they fell upon as grave, as attentive, and as deeply interested a multitude, as was probably ever before lighted by his morning beams. </s>
<s>  its number somewhat exceeded a thousand souls. </s>
<s>  in a collection of so serious savages, there is never to be found any impatient aspirant after premature distinction, standing ready to move his auditors to some hasty,  perhaps, injudicious discussion, in order that his own reputation may be the gainer. </s>
<s>  an act of so much precipitancy and presumption would seal the downfall of precocious intellect forever. </s>
<s>  it rested solely with the oldest and most experienced of the men to lay the subject of the conference before the people. </s>
<s>  until such a one chose to make some movement, no deeds in arms, no natural gifts, nor any renown as an orator, would have justified the slightest interruption. </s>
<s>  on the present occasion, the aged warrior whose privilege it was to speak, was silent, seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of his subject. </s>
<s>  the delay had already continued long beyond the usual deliberative pause that always preceded a conference. </s>
<s>  but no sign of impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy. </s>
<s>  occasionally an eye was raised from the earth, where the looks of most were riveted, and strayed toward a particular lodge, that was, however, in no manner distinguished from those around it, except in the peculiar care that had been taken to protect it against the assaults of the weather. </s>
<s>  at length one of those low murmurs, that are so apt to disturb a multitude, was heard, and the whole nation arose to their feet by a common impulse. </s>
<s>  at that instant the door of the lodge in question opened, and three men, issuing from it, slowly approached the place of consultation. </s>
<s>  they were all aged, even beyond that period to which the oldest present had reached. </s>
<s>  but one in the center, who leaned on his companions for support, had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is seldom permitted to attain. </s>
<s>  his frame, which had once been tall and erect, like the cedar, was now bending under the pressure of more than a century. </s>
<s>  the elastic, light step of an indian was gone, and in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground, inch by inch. </s>
<s>  his dark, wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders, in such thickness, as to announce that generations had probably passed away since they had last been shorn. </s>
<s>  the dress of this patriarch--for such, considering his vast age, in conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people, he might very properly be termed--was rich and imposing, though strictly after the simple fashions of the tribe. </s>
<s>  his robe was of the finest skins, which had been deprived of their fur, in order to admit of a hieroglyphical representation of various deeds in arms, done in former ages. </s>
<s>  his bosom was loaded with medals, some in massive silver, and one or two even in gold, the gifts of various christian potentates during the long period of his life. </s>
<s>  he also wore armlets, and cinctures above the ankles, of the latter precious metal. </s>
<s>  his head, on the whole of which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having so long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in its turn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich feathers, dyed a deep black, in touching contrast to the color of his snow-white locks. </s>
<s>  his tomahawk was nearly hid in silver, and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold. </s>
<s>  so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure, which the sudden appearance of this venerated individual created, had a little subsided, the name of "tamenund" was whispered from mouth to mouth. </s>
<s>  magua had often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware. </s>
<s>  a reputation that even proceeded so far as to bestow on him the rare gift of holding secret communion with the great spirit, and which has since transmitted his name, with some slight alteration, to the white usurpers of his ancient territory, as the imaginary tutelar saint of a vast empire. </s>
<s>  the huron chief, therefore, stepped eagerly out a little from the throng, to a spot whence he might catch a nearer glimpse of the features of the man, whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his own fortunes. </s>
<s>   the americans sometimes called their tutelar saint tamenay, a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here introduced. </s>
<s>  there are many traditions which speak of the character and power of tamenund. </s>
<s>  the eyes of the old man were closed, as though the organs were wearied with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human passions. </s>
<s>  the color of his skin differed from that of most around him, being richer and darker, the latter having been produced by certain delicate and mazy lines of complicated and yet beautiful figures, which had been traced over most of his person by the operation of tattooing. </s>
<s>  notwithstanding the position of the huron, he passed the observant and silent magua without notice, and leaning on his two venerable supporters proceeded to the high place of the multitude, where he seated himself in the center of his nation, with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a father. </s>
<s>  nothing could surpass the reverence and affection with which this unexpected visit from one who belongs rather to another world than to this, was received by his people. </s>
<s>  after a suitable and decent pause, the principal chiefs arose,  approaching the patriarch, they placed his hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat a blessing. </s>
<s>  the younger men were content with touching his robe, or even drawing nigh his person, in order to breathe in the atmosphere of one so aged, so just, and so valiant. </s>
<s>  none but the most distinguished among the youthful warriors even presumed to far as to perform the latter ceremony, the great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness to look upon a form so deeply venerated, and so well beloved. </s>
<s>  when these acts of affection and respect were performed, the chiefs drew back again to their several places, and silence reigned in the whole encampment. </s>
<s>  after a short delay, a few of the young men, to whom instructions had been whispered by one of the aged attendants of tamenund, arose, left the crowd, and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the object of so much attention throughout that morning. </s>
<s>  in a few minutes they reappeared, escorting the individuals who had caused all these solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment. </s>
<s>  the crowd opened in a lane. </s>
<s>  and when the party had re- entered, it closed in again, forming a large and dense belt of human bodies, arranged in an open circle. </s>
<s>  chapter 29 "the assembly seated, rising o'er the rest, achilles thus the king of men addressed. </s>
<s> "--pope's illiad cora stood foremost among the prisoners, entwining her arms in those of alice, in the tenderness of sisterly love. </s>
<s>  notwithstanding the fearful and menacing array of savages on every side of her, no apprehension on her own account could prevent the nobler-minded maiden from keeping her eyes fastened on the pale and anxious features of the trembling alice. </s>
<s>  close at their side stood heyward, with an interest in both, that, at such a moment of intense uncertainty, scarcely knew a preponderance in favor of her whom he most loved. </s>
<s>  hawkeye had placed himself a little in the rear, with a deference to the superior rank of his companions, that no similarity in the state of their present fortunes could induce him to forget. </s>
<s>  uncas was not there. </s>
<s>  when perfect silence was again restored, and after the usual long, impressive pause, one of the two aged chiefs who sat at the side of the patriarch arose, and demanded aloud, in very intelligible english: "which of my prisoners is la longue carabine?" neither duncan nor the scout answered. </s>
<s>  the former, however, glanced his eyes around the dark and silent assembly, and recoiled a pace, when they fell on the malignant visage of magua. </s>
<s>  he saw, at once, that this wily savage had some secret agency in their present arraignment before the nation, and determined to throw every possible impediment in the way of the execution of his sinister plans. </s>
<s>  he had witnessed one instance of the summary punishments of the indians, and now dreaded that his companion was to be selected for a second. </s>
<s>  in this dilemma, with little or no time for reflection, he suddenly determined to cloak his invaluable friend, at any or every hazard to himself. </s>
<s>  before he had time, however, to speak, the question was repeated in a louder voice, and with a clearer utterance. </s>
<s>  "give us arms," the young man haughtily replied, "and place us in yonder woods. </s>
<s>  our deeds shall speak for us!" "this is the warrior whose name has filled our ears!" returned the chief, regarding heyward with that sort of curious interest which seems inseparable from man, when first beholding one of his fellows to whom merit or accident, virtue or crime, has given notoriety. </s>
<s>  "what has brought the white man into the camp of the delawares?" "my necessities. </s>
<s>  i come for food, shelter, and friends. </s>
<s> " "it cannot be. </s>
<s>  the woods are full of game. </s>
<s>  the head of a warrior needs no other shelter than a sky without clouds. </s>
<s>  and the delawares are the enemies, and not the friends of the yengeese. </s>
<s>  go, the mouth has spoken, while the heart said nothing. </s>
<s> " duncan, a little at a loss in what manner to proceed, remained silent. </s>
<s>  but the scout, who had listened attentively to all that passed, now advanced steadily to the front. </s>
<s>  "that i did not answer to the call for la longue carabine, was not owing either to shame or fear," he said, "for neither one nor the other is the gift of an honest man. </s>
<s>  but i do not admit the right of the mingoes to bestow a name on one whose friends have been mindful of his gifts, in this particular. </s>
<s>  especially as their title is a lie, 'killdeer' being a grooved barrel and no carabyne. </s>
<s>  i am the man, however, that got the name of nathaniel from my kin. </s>
<s>  the compliment of hawkeye from the delawares, who live on their own river. </s>
<s>  and whom the iroquois have presumed to style the 'long rifle', without any warranty from him who is most concerned in the matter. </s>
<s> " the eyes of all present, which had hitherto been gravely scanning the person of duncan, were now turned, on the instant, toward the upright iron frame of this new pretender to the distinguished appellation. </s>
<s>  it was in no degree remarkable that there should be found two who were willing to claim so great an honor, for impostors, though rare, were not unknown among the natives. </s>
<s>  but it was altogether material to the just and severe intentions of the delawares, that there should be no mistake in the matter. </s>
<s>  some of their old men consulted together in private, and then, as it would seem, they determined to interrogate their visitor on the subject. </s>
<s>  "my brother has said that a snake crept into my camp," said the chief to magua. </s>
<s>  "which is he?" the huron pointed to the scout. </s>
<s>  "will a wise delaware believe the barking of a wolf?" exclaimed duncan, still more confirmed in the evil intentions of his ancient enemy: " a dog never lies, but when was a wolf known to speak the truth?" the eyes of magua flashed fire. </s>
<s>  but suddenly recollecting the necessity of maintaining his presence of mind, he turned away in silent disdain, well assured that the sagacity of the indians would not fail to extract the real merits of the point in controversy. </s>
<s>  he was not deceived. </s>
<s>  for, after another short consultation, the wary delaware turned to him again, and expressed the determination of the chiefs, though in the most considerate language. </s>
<s>  "my brother has been called a liar," he said, "and his friends are angry. </s>
<s>  they will show that he has spoken the truth. </s>
<s>  give my prisoners guns, and let them prove which is the man. </s>
<s> " magua affected to consider the expedient, which he well knew proceeded from distrust of himself, as a compliment, and made a gesture of acquiescence, well content that his veracity should be supported by so skillful a marksman as the scout. </s>
<s>  the weapons were instantly placed in the hands of the friendly opponents, and they were bid to fire, over the heads of the seated multitude, at an earthen vessel, which lay, by accident, on a stump, some fifty yards from the place where they stood. </s>
<s>  heyward smiled to himself at the idea of a competition with the scout, though he determined to persevere in the deception, until apprised of the real designs of magua. </s>
<s>  raising his rifle with the utmost care, and renewing his aim three several times, he fired. </s>
<s>  the bullet cut the wood within a few inches of the vessel. </s>
<s>  and a general exclamation of satisfaction announced that the shot was considered a proof of great skill in the use of a weapon. </s>
<s>  even hawkeye nodded his head, as if he would say, it was better than he expected. </s>
<s>   instead of manifesting an intention to contend with the successful marksman, he stood leaning on his rifle for more than a minute, like a man who was completely buried in thought. </s>
<s>  from this reverie, he was, however, awakened by one of the young indians who had furnished the arms, and who now touched his shoulder, saying in exceedingly broken english: "can the pale face beat it?" "yes, huron!" exclaimed the scout, raising the short rifle in his right h and shaking it at magua, with as much apparent ease as if it were a reed. </s>
<s>  "yes, huron, i could strike you now, and no power on earth could prevent the deed! the soaring hawk is not more certain of the dove than i am this moment of you, did i choose to send a bullet to your heart! why should i not? why!--because the gifts of my color forbid it, and i might draw down evil on tender and innocent heads. </s>
<s>  if you know such a being as god, thank him, therefore, in your inward soul. </s>
<s>  for you have reason!" the flushed countenance, angry eye and swelling figure of the scout, produced a sensation of secret awe in all that heard him. </s>
<s>  the delawares held their breath in expectation. </s>
<s>  but magua himself, even while he distrusted the forbearance of his enemy, remained immovable and calm, where he stood wedged in by the crowd, as one who grew to the spot. </s>
<s>  "beat it," repeated the young delaware at the elbow of the scout. </s>
<s>  "beat what, fool!--what?" exclaimed hawkeye, still flourishing the weapon angrily above his head, though his eye no longer sought the person of magua. </s>
<s>  "if the white man is the warrior he pretends," said the aged chief, "let him strike nigher to the mark. </s>
<s> " the scout laughed aloud--a noise that produced the startling effect of an unnatural sound on heyward. </s>
<s>  then dropping the piece, heavily, into his extended left h it was discharged, apparently by the shock, driving the fragments of the vessel into the air, and scattering them on every side. </s>
<s>  almost at the same instant, the rattling sound of the rifle was heard, as he suffered it to fall, contemptuously, to the earth. </s>
<s>  the first impression of so strange a scene was engrossing admiration. </s>
<s>  then a low, but increasing murmur, ran through the multitude, and finally swelled into sounds that denoted a lively opposition in the sentiments of the spectators. </s>
<s>  while some openly testified their satisfaction at so unexampled dexterity, by far the larger portion of the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the shot was the result of accident. </s>
<s>  heyward was not slow to confirm an opinion that was so favorable to his own pretensions. </s>
<s>  "it was chance!" he exclaimed. </s>
<s>  "none can shoot without an aim!" "chance!" echoed the excited woodsman, who was now stubbornly bent on maintaining his identity at every hazard, and on whom the secret hints of heyward to acquiesce in the deception were entirely lost. </s>
<s>  "does yonder lying huron, too, think it chance? give him another gun, and place us face to face, without cover or dodge, and let providence, and our own eyes, decide the matter atween us! i do not make the offer, to you, major. </s>
<s>  for our blood is of a color, and we serve the same master. </s>
<s> " "that the huron is a liar, is very evident," returned heyward, coolly. </s>
<s>  "you have yourself heard him asset you to be la longue carabine. </s>
<s> " it were impossible to say what violent assertion the stubborn hawkeye would have next made, in his headlong wish to vindicate his identity, had not the aged delaware once more interposed. </s>
<s>  "the hawk which comes from the clouds can return when he will," he said. </s>
<s>  "give them the guns. </s>
<s> " this time the scout seized the rifle with avidity. </s>
<s>  nor had magua, though he watched the movements of the marksman with jealous eyes, any further cause for apprehension. </s>
<s>  "now let it be proved, in the face of this tribe of delawares, which is the better man," cried the scout, tapping the butt of his piece with that finger which had pulled so many fatal triggers. </s>
<s>  "you see that gourd hanging against yonder tree, major. </s>
<s>  if you are a marksman fit for the borders, let me see you break its shell!" duncan noted the object, and prepared himself to renew the trial. </s>
<s>  the gourd was one of the usual little vessels used by the indians, and it was suspended from a dead branch of a small pine, by a thong of deerskin, at the full distance of a hundred yards. </s>
<s>  so strangely compounded is the feeling of self-love, that the young soldier, while he knew the utter worthlessness of the suffrages of his savage umpires, forgot the sudden motives of the contest in a wish to excel. </s>
<s>  it had been seen, already, that his skill was far from being contemptible, and he now resolved to put forth its nicest qualities. </s>
<s>  had his life depended on the issue, the aim of duncan could not have been more deliberate or guarded. </s>
<s>  he fired. </s>
<s>  and three or four young indians, who sprang forward at the report, announced with a shout, that the ball was in the tree, a very little on one side of the proper object. </s>
<s>  the warriors uttered a common ejaculation of pleasure, and then turned their eyes, inquiringly, on the movements of his rival. </s>
<s>  "it may do for the royal americans!" said hawkeye, laughing once more in his own silent, heartfelt manner. </s>
<s>  "but had my gun often turned so much from the true line, many a marten, whose skin is now in a lady's muff, would still be in the woods. </s>
<s>  ay, and many a bloody mingo, who has departed to his final account, would be acting his deviltries at this very day, atween the provinces. </s>
<s>  i hope the squaw who owns the gourd has more of them in her wigwam, for this will never hold water again!" the scout had shook his priming, and cocked his piece, while speaking. </s>
<s>   as he ended, he threw back a foot, and slowly raised the muzzle from the earth: the motion was steady, uniform, and in one direction. </s>
<s>  when on a perfect level, it remained for a single moment, without tremor or variation, as though both man and rifle were carved in stone. </s>
<s>  during that stationary instant, it poured forth its contents, in a bright, glancing sheet of flame. </s>
<s>  again the young indians bounded forward. </s>
<s>  but their hurried search and disappointed looks announced that no traces of the bullet were to be seen. </s>
<s>  "go!" said the old chief to the scout, in a tone of strong disgust. </s>
<s>  "thou art a wolf in the skin of a dog. </s>
<s>  i will talk to the 'long rifle' of the yengeese. </s>
<s> " "ah! had i that piece which furnished the name you use, i would obligate myself to cut the thong, and drop the gourd without breaking it!" returned hawkeye, perfectly undisturbed by the other's manner. </s>
<s>  "fools, if you would find the bullet of a sharpshooter in these woods, you must look in the object, and not around it!" the indian youths instantly comprehended his meaning--for this time he spoke in the delaware tongue--and tearing the gourd from the tree, they held it on high with an exulting shout, displaying a hole in its bottom, which had been but by the bullet, after passing through the usual orifice in the center of its upper side. </s>
<s>  at this unexpected exhibition, a loud and vehement expression of pleasure burst from the mouth of every warrior present. </s>
<s>  it decided the question, and effectually established hawkeye in the possession of his dangerous reputation. </s>
<s>  those curious and admiring eyes which had been turned again on heyward, were finally directed to the weather-beaten form of the scout, who immediately became the principal object of attention to the simple and unsophisticated beings by whom he was surrounded. </s>
<s>  when the sudden and noisy commotion had a little subsided, the aged chief resumed his examination. </s>
<s>  "why did you wish to stop my ears?" he said, addressing duncan. </s>
<s>  "are the delawares fools that they could not know the young panther from the cat?" "they will yet find the huron a singing-bird," said duncan, endeavoring to adopt the figurative language of the natives. </s>
<s>  "it is good. </s>
<s>  we will know who can shut the ears of men. </s>
<s>  brother," added the chief turning his eyes on magua, "the delawares listen. </s>
<s> " thus singled, and directly called on to declare his object, the huron arose. </s>
<s>  and advancing with great deliberation and dignity into the very center of the circle, where he stood confronted by the prisoners, he placed himself in an attitude to speak. </s>
<s>  before opening his mouth, however, he bent his eyes slowly along the whole living boundary of earnest faces, as if to temper his expressions to the capacities of his audience. </s>
<s>  on hawkeye he cast a glance of respectful enmity. </s>
<s>  on duncan, a look of inextinguishable hatred. </s>
<s>  the shrinking figure of alice he scarcely deigned to notice. </s>
<s>  but when his glance met the firm, commanding, and yet lovely form of cora, his eye lingered a moment, with an expression that it might have been difficult to define. </s>
<s>  then, filled with his own dark intentions, he spoke in the language of the canadas, a tongue that he well knew was comprehended by most of his auditors. </s>
<s>  "the spirit that made men colored them differently," commenced the subtle huron. </s>
<s>  "some are blacker than the sluggish bear. </s>
<s>  these he said should be slaves. </s>
<s>  and he ordered them to work forever, like the beaver. </s>
<s>  you may hear them groan, when the south wind blows, louder than the lowing buffaloes, along the shores of the great salt lake, where the big canoes come and go with them in droves. </s>
<s>  some he made with faces paler than the ermine of the forests. </s>
<s>  and these he ordered to be traders. </s>
<s>  dogs to their women, and wolves to their slaves. </s>
<s>  he gave this people the nature of the pigeon. </s>
<s>  wings that never tire. </s>
<s>  young, more plentiful than the leaves on the trees, and appetites to devour the earth. </s>
<s>  he gave them tongues like the false call of the wildcat. </s>

<s>  bertie and billy wrote the full time allotted, and found that they could have filled an hour more without coming to the end of their thoughts. </s>
<s>  comparing notes at lunch, their information was discovered to have been lacking here and there. </s>
<s>  nevertheless, it was no failure. </s>
<s>  their inner convictions were sure of fifty per cent at least, and this was all they asked of the gods. </s>
<s>  "i was ripping about the ego," said bertie. </s>
<s>  "i was rather splendid myself," said billy, "when i got going. </s>
<s>  and i gave him a huge steer about memory. </s>
<s> " after lunch both retired to their beds and fell into sweet oblivion until seven o'clock, when they rose and dined, and after playing a little poker went to bed again pretty early. </s>
<s>  some six mornings later, when the professor returned their papers to them, their minds were washed almost as clear of plato and thales as were their bodies of yesterday's dust. </s>
<s>  the dates and doctrines, hastily memorized to rattle off upon the great occasion, lay only upon the surface of their minds, and after use they quickly evaporated. </s>
<s>  to their pleasure and most genuine astonishment, the professor paid them high compliments. </s>
<s>  bertie's discussion of the double personality had been the most intelligent which had come in from any of the class. </s>
<s>  the illustration of the intoxicated hack-driver who had fallen from his hack and inquired who it was that had fallen, and then had pitied himself, was, said the professor, as original and perfect an illustration of our subjective-objectivity as he had met with in all his researches. </s>
<s>  and billy's suggestions concerning the inherency of time and space in the mind the professor had also found very striking and independent, particularly his reasoning based upon the well-known distortions of time and space which hashish and other drugs produce in us. </s>
<s>  this was the sort of thing which the professor had wanted from his students: free comment and discussions, the spirit of the course, rather than any strict adherence to the letter. </s>
<s>  he had constructed his questions to elicit as much individual discussion as possible and had been somewhat disappointed in his hopes. </s>
<s>  yes, bertie and billy were astonished. </s>
<s>  but their astonishment did not equal that of oscar, who had answered many of the questions in the professor's own language. </s>
<s>  oscar received seventy-five per cent for this achievement--a good mark. </s>
<s>  but billy's mark was eighty-six and bertie's ninety. </s>
<s>  "there is some mistake," said oscar to them when they told him . </s>
<s>  and he hastened to the professor with his tale. </s>
<s>  "there is no mistake," said the professor. </s>
<s>  oscar smiled with increased deference. </s>
<s>  "" he urged, "i assure you, sir, those young men knew absolutely nothing. </s>
<s>  i was their tutor, and they knew nothing at all. </s>
<s>  i taught them all their information myself. </s>
<s> " "in that case," replied the professor, not pleased with oscar's tale-bearing, "you must have given them more than you could spare. </s>
<s>  good morning. </s>
<s> " oscar never understood. </s>
<s>  but he graduated considerably higher than bertie and billy, who were not able to discover many other courses so favorable to "orriginal rresearch" as was philosophy 4. </s>
<s>  that is twenty years ago, to-day bertie is treasurer of the new amsterdam trust company, in wall street. </s>
<s>  billy is superintendent of passenger traffic of the new york and chicago air line. </s>
<s>  oscar is successful too. </s>
<s>  he has acquired a lot of information. </s>

<s>  209 the bobbsey twins at school chapter i a circus train "mamma, how much longer have we got to ride?" asked nan bobbsey, turning in her seat in the railroad car, to look at her parents, who sat behind her. </s>
<s>  "are you getting tired?" asked nan's brother bert. </s>
<s>  "if you are i'll sit next to the window, and watch the telegraph poles and trees go by. </s>
<s>   maybe that's what tires you, nan," he added, and his father smiled, for he saw that bert had two thoughts for himself, and one for his sister. </s>
<s>  "no, i am not tired of the scenery," answered the brownhaired and browneyed girl, "but you may sit next the window, bert, if you like. </s>
<s> " "thanks!" he exclaimed as he scrambled over to the place his sister gave up. </s>
<s>  "are you tired, dearie?" asked mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, leaning forward and smoothing out her daughter's hair with her hand. </s>
<s>  "if you would like to sit with me and put your head in my lap, papa can go to another seat and  -" "oh, no, mamma, i am not as tired as that," and nan laughed. </s>
<s>  "i was just wondering how soon we'd be home. </s>
<s> " "i would rather be back at the seashore," said bert, not turning his gaze from the window, for the train was passing along some fields just then, and in one a boy was driving home some cows to be milked, as evening was coming on. </s>
<s>  bert was wondering if one of the cows might not chase the boy. </s>
<s>  bert didn't really want to see the boy hurt by a cow, of course, but he thought that if the cow was going to take after the boy, anyhow, he might just as well see it. </s>
<s>  but the cows were very well-behaved, and went along slowly. </s>
<s>  "yes, the seashore was nice," murmured nan, as she leaned her head back on the cushioned seat, "but i am glad to be going home again. </s>
<s>  i want to see some of the girls, and -" "yes, and i'll be looking for some of the boys, too," put in bert. </s>
<s>  "but school will soon begin, and that's no fun!" mr. </s>
<s>  and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey smiled at each other, and mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, taking out a timetable, looked to see how much longer they would be on the train. </s>
<s>  "it's about an hour yet," he said to nan, and she sighed. </s>
<s>  really she was more tired than she cared to let her mother know. </s>
<s>  just ahead of the two bobbsey children were another set of them. </s>
<s>  i say "set" for the bobbsey children came "in sets. </s>
<s> " there were two pairs of twins, bert and nan, nearly nine years of age, and flossie and freddie, almost five. </s>
<s>   whereas the two older children were rather tall and slim, with dark brown hair and eyes, the littler twins were short and fat, and had light hair and blue eyes. </s>
<s>  the two pairs of twins were quite a contrast, and many persons stopped to look at them as they passed along the street together. </s>
<s>  "no, sir," went on bert musingly, "school's no fun, and it starts about a week after we get home. </s>
<s>  no chance to have a good time!" "we've had fun all summer," replied his sister. </s>
<s>  "i rather like school. </s>
<s> " "mamma, are we going to school this year?" asked flossie, as she looked back with a quick turning of her head that set her yellow curls to dancing. </s>
<s>  "if we are, i am going to sit with flossie - can't i?" asked freddie, kneeling in the seat so that he could face back to his father and mother. </s>
<s>  indeed his request was not strange, since the two younger twins were always together even more so than their brother and sister. </s>
<s>  "yes, i think you and freddie will start school regularly this term," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, " if it can be arranged, you may sit together. </s>
<s>   we'll see about that. </s>
<s>  be careful, freddie, don't put your head out of the window," she cautioned quickly, for the little chap had turned in his seat again, and was leaning forward to see a horse galloping about a field, kicking up its heels at the sound of the puffing engine. </s>
<s>  "it's my turn to sit by the window, anyhow," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "it is not! we haven't passed a station yet," disputed freddie. </s>
<s>  "oh, we have so!" cried his little sister. </s>
<s>  "freddie bobbsey!" and she pointed her finger at him. </s>
<s>  "children - children," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, reprovingly. </s>
<s>  "are you two taking turns?" asked bert, smiling with an older brother's superior wisdom. </s>
<s>  "yes," answered flossie, "he was to have the seat next to the window until we came to a station, and then it's to be my turn until we pass another station, and we have passed one, but he won't change over. </s>
<s> " "well, it was only a little station, anyhow," asserted freddie, "and it came awful quick after the last one. </s>
<s>  it isn't fair!" "there's a seat up ahead for you, bert," suggested mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, as a gentleman got up, when the train approached a station. </s>
<s> " you can sit there, and let flossie or freddie take your place. </s>
<s> " "all right," answered bert goodnaturedly, as he got up. </s>
<s>  the train rolled on, the two younger twins each having a window now, and nan occupying the seat with her little brother. </s>
<s>  for a time there was quietness, until mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey said to her husband: "hadn't you better get some of the satchels together, richard, and tell dinah what she is to carry?" "i think i will," he answered, as he went up the car aisle a little way to where a very fat colored woman sat. </s>
<s>  she was dinah, the bobbsey cook, and they took her with them always when going away for the summer. </s>
<s>  now they were on their way to their city house, and of course dinah came back, too. </s>
<s>  "mamma, i am thirsty," said flossie, after a bit. </s>
<s>  "please may i get a drink?" "i want one, too," said freddie quicky. </s>
<s>  "come on, flossie, we'll both go down to the end of the car where the water cooler is. </s>
<s> " "there's no cup," nan said. </s>
<s>  "i went a little while ago, but a lady let me take her glass. </s>
<s> " "and if there was a cup, i would rather they didn't use it," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "one never knows who has last handled a public cup. </s>
<s> " "but i want a drink," insisted flossie, a bit fretfully, for she was tired from the long journey. </s>
<s>  "i know it, dear," said her mamma gently, "and i am getting out the silver cup for you. </s>
<s>  only you must be very careful of it, and not drop it, for it is solid silver and will dent, or mar, easily. </s>
<s> " she was searching in her bag, and presently took out a very valuable drinking cup, gold lined and with much engraving on it. </s>
<s>  the cup had been presented to flossie and freddie on their first birthday, and bore each of their names. </s>
<s>  they were very proud of it. </s>
<s>  "now be careful," warned mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, as she held out the cup. </s>
<s>  "hold on to the seats as you walk along. </s>
<s> " "i'll carry the cup," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "i am the biggest. </s>
<s> " "you are not!" declared his sister quickly. </s>
<s>  "i am just as big. </s>
<s> " "well, anyhow, i am a boy," went on freddie, and flossie could not deny this. </s>
<s>  "and boys always carries things," her brother went on. </s>
<s>  "i'll carry the cup. </s>
<s> " "very well, but be careful of it," said his mother with a smile, as she handed it to him. </s>
<s>  the two children went down the aisle of the car. </s>
<s>   they stopped for a moment at the seat where dinah was. </s>
<s>  "is snoop all right?" asked freddie, peering into a box that was made of slats, with spaces between them for air. </s>
<s>  "'deed an' he am, honey," said dinah with a smile, laughing so that she shook all over her big, fleshy body. </s>
<s>  "i 'specs he is lonesome. </s>
<s>  aren't you, snoop?" asked flossie, poking her finger in one of the cracks, to caress, as well as she could, a fat, black cat. </s>
<s>  the cat, like dinah the cook, went with the bobbseys on all their summer outings. </s>
<s>  "well, maybe he am lonesome," admitted dinah, with another laugh, "but he is been real good. </s>
<s>  he hadn't yowled once - not once!" "he'll soon be out of his cage. </s>
<s>  won't you, snoop?" said freddie, and then he and his sister went on to the water cooler. </s>
<s>  near it they saw something else to look at. </s>
<s>  this was the sight of a very, very fat lady who occupied nearly all of one seat in the end of the car. </s>
<s>  she was so large that only a very little baby could have found room beside her. </s>
<s>  "look - look at her," whispered flossie to freddie, as they paused. </s>
<s>  the fat woman's back was toward them, and she seemed to be much interested in looking out of the window. </s>
<s>  "she is fat," admitted freddie. </s>
<s>  "did you ever see one so big before?" "only in a circus," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "she would make make two of dinah," went on her brother. </s>
<s>  "she would not," contradicted flossie quickly. </s>
<s>  "'cause dinah's black, and this lady is white. </s>
<s> " "that's so," admitted freddie, with smile. </s>
<s>  "i didn't think of that. </s>
<s> " a sway of the train nearly made flossic fall, and she caught quickly at her brother. </s>
<s>  "look out!" he cried. </s>
<s>  "you 'mos knocked the cup down. </s>
<s> " "i didn't mean to," spoke flossie. </s>
<s>  "oh, there goes my hat! get it, freddie, before someone steps on it!" her brother managed to get the hat just as it was sliding under the seat where the fat lady sat. </s>
<s>  after some confusion the hat was placed on flossie's head, and once more she and her brother moved on toward the water cooler. </s>
<s>  it was getting dusk now, and some of the lamps in the car had been lighted. </s>
<s>  freddie, carrying the cup, filled it with water at the little faucet,  very politely, offered it to his sister first. </s>
<s>  freddie was no better than most boys of his age, but he did not forget some of the little polite ways his mamma was continually teaching him. </s>
<s>  one of these was "ladies first," though freddie did not always carry it out, especially when he was in a hurry. </s>
<s>  "do you want any more?" he asked, before he would get himself a drink. </s>
<s>  "just a little," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "the silver cup doesn't hold much. </s>
<s> " "no, i guess it's 'cause there's so much silver in it," replied her brother. </s>
<s>  "it's worth a lot of money, mamma said. </s>
<s> " "yes, and it's all ours. </s>
<s>  when i grow up i am going to have my half made into a bracelet. </s>
<s> " "you are?" said freddie slowly. </s>
<s>  "if you do there won't be enough left for me to drink out of. </s>
<s> " "well, you can have your share of it made into a watch, and drink out of a glass. </s>
<s> " "that's so," agreed freddie, his face brightening. </s>
<s>  he gave his sister more water, and then took some himself. </s>
<s>  as he drank his eyes were constantly looking at the very fat lady who filled so much of her seat. </s>
<s>   she turned from the window and looked at the two children, smiling broadly. </s>
<s>  freddie was somewhat confused, and looked down quickly. </s>
<s>  just then the train gave another lurch and freddie suddenly spilled some of the water on his coat. </s>
<s>  "oh, look what you did!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "and that's your best coat!" "i - i couldn't help it," stammered freddie. </s>
<s>  "never mind, little boy," said the fat lady. </s>
<s>  "it's only clean water. </s>
<s>   come here and i'll wipe it off with my handkerchief. </s>
<s>  i would come to you, only i am so stout it's hard enough for me to walk anyhow, and when the train is moving i simply can't do it. </s>
<s> " freddie and flossie went to her seat, and with a handkerchief, that flossie said afterward was almost as big as a table cloth, the fat lady wiped the water off freddie's coat. </s>
<s>  the little boy held the silver cup in his h and feeling, somehow, that he ought to repay the fat lady's kindness in some way, after thanking her, he asked: "would you like a drink of water? i can bring it to you if you would. </s>
<s> " "thank you," she answered. </s>
<s>  "what a kind little boy you are! i saw you give your sister a drink first, too. </s>
<s>  yes, i would like a drink. </s>
<s>  i have been wanting one some time, but i didn't dare get up to go after it. </s>
<s> " "i'll get it!" cried freddie, eager to show what a little man he was. </s>
<s>   he made his way to the cooler without accident, and then, moving slowly, taking hold of the seat on the way back, so as not to spill the water, he brought the silver cup brimful to the fat lady. </s>
<s>  "oh, what a beautiful cup," she said, as she took it. </s>
<s>  "and it cost a lot of money, too," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "it's ours - our birthday cup, and when i grow up i am going to have a bracelet made from my half. </s>
<s> " "that will be nice," said the fat lady, as she prepared to drink. </s>
<s>  but she never got more than a sip of the water freddie had so kindly brought her, for, no sooner did her lips touch the cup than there was a grinding, shrieking sound, a jar to the railway coach, and the train came to such a sudden stop that many passengers were thrown from their seats. </s>
<s>  flossie and freddie sat down suddenly in the aisle, but they were so fat that they did not mind it in the least. </s>
<s>  as surprised as he was, freddie noticed that the fat lady was so large that she could not be thrown out of her seat, no matter how suddenly the train stopped. </s>
<s>  the little bobbsey boy saw the water from the cup spill all over the fat lady, and she held the silver vessel in her big, pudgy h looking curiously at it, as though wondering what had so quickly become of the water. </s>
<s>  "it's a wreck - the train's off the track!" a man exclaimed. </s>
<s>  "we've hit something!" cried another. </s>
<s>  "it's an accident, anyhow," said still a third, and then every one seemed to be talking at once. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey came running down the aisle to where flossie and freddie still sat, dazed. </s>
<s>  "are you hurt?" he cried, picking them both up together, which was rather hard to do. </s>
<s>  "no - no," said freddie slowly. </s>
<s>  "oh, papa, what is it?" asked flossie, wondering whether she was going to cry. </s>
<s>  "i don't know, my dear. </s>
<s>  nothing serious, i guess. </s>
<s>  the engineer must have put the brakes on too quickly. </s>
<s>  i'll look out and see. </s>
<s> " knowing that his children were safe, mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey put them down and led them back to where his wife was anxiously waiting. </s>
<s>  "they are all right," he called. </s>
<s>  "no one seems to be hurt. </s>
<s> " bert bobbsey looked out of the window. </s>
<s>  though darkness had fallen there seemed to be many lights up ahead of the stopped train. </s>
<s>  and in the light bert could see some camels, an elephant or two, a number of horses, and cages containing lions and tigers strung out along the track. </s>
<s>  "why - why, what's this - a circus?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "look, nan! see those monkeys!" "why, it is a circus - and the train must have been wrecked!" exclaimed his sister. </s>
<s>  "oh mamma, what can it be?" a brakeman came into the car where the bobbseys were. </s>
<s>  "there's no danger," he said. </s>
<s>  "please keep your seats. </s>
<s>  a circus train that was running ahead of us got off the track, and some of the animals are loose. </s>
<s>  our train nearly ran into an elephant, and that's why the engineer had to stop so suddenly. </s>
<s>  we will go on i soon. </s>
<s> " "a circus, eh?" said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "well, well! this is an adventure, children. </s>
<s>  we've run into a circus train! let's watch them catch the animals. </s>
<s> " chapter ii snoop is gone "papa, do you think a tiger would come in here?" asked freddie, remembering all the stories of wild animals he had heard in his four years. </s>
<s>  "or a lion?" asked flossie. </s>
<s>  "of course not!" exclaimed nan. </s>
<s>  "can't you see that all the wild animals are still in their cages?" "maybe some of 'em are loose," suggested freddie, and he almost hoped so, as long as his father was there to protect him. </s>
<s>  "i guess the circus men can look after them," said bert. </s>
<s>  "may i get off, father, and look around?" "i would rather you wouldn't, son. </s>
<s>  you can't tell what may happen. </s>
<s> " "oh, look at that man after the monkey!" cried nan. </s>
<s>  "yes, and the monkey's gone up on top of the tiger's cage," added bert. </s>
<s>  "say, this is as good as a circus, anyhow!" some of the big, flaring lights, used in the tents at night, had been set going so the circus and railroad men could see to work, and this glare gave the bobbseys and other passengers on the train a chance to see what was going on. </s>
<s>  "there's a big elephant!" cried freddie. </s>
<s>  "see him push the lion's cage around. </s>
<s>  elephants are awful strong!" "they couldn't push a railroad train," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "they could too!" cried her little brother, quickly. </s>
<s>  "they could not. </s>
<s>  could they, papa?" "what?" asked mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, absentmindedly. </s>
<s>  "could an elephant push a railroad train?" asked flossie. </s>
<s>  "i know they could," declared freddie. </s>
<s>  "couldn't they, papa?" "now, children, don't argue. </s>
<s>  look out of the windows," adivsed their mother. </s>
<s>  and while the circus men are trying to catch the escaped animals i will tell you something more about the bobbseys, and about the other books, before this one, relating to their doings. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  richard bobbsey, and his wife mary, the parents of the bobbsey twins, lived in an eastern city called lakeport, on lake metoka. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey was in the lumber business, and the yard, with its great piles of logs and boards, was near the lake, on which the twins often went in boats. </s>
<s>  there was also a river running into the lake, not far from the saw mill. </s>
<s>  their house was about a quarter of a mile away from the lumber yard, on a fashionable street, and about it was a large lawn, while in the back sam johnson, the colored man of all work, and the husband of dinah, had a fine garden. </s>
<s>  the bobbseys had many vegetables from this garden. </s>
<s>  there was also a barn near the house, and in this the children had many good times. </s>
<s>  flossie and freddie played there more than did nan and bert, who were growing too old for games of that sort. </s>
<s>  as i have said, bert and nan were rather tall and thin, while flossie and freddie were short and fat. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey used often to call flossie his "fat fairy," which always made her laugh. </s>
<s>  and freddie had a pet name, too. </s>
<s>  it was "fat fireman," for he often played that he was a fireman. </s>
<s>  putting out makebelieve fires, and pretending he was a fire engine. </s>
<s>  once or twice his father had taken him to see a real one, and this pleased freddie very much. </s>
<s>  in the first book of this series, called "the bobbsey twins," i told you something of the fun the four children had in their home town. </s>
<s>  they had troubles, too, and danny rugg, one of the few bad boys in lakeport, was the cause of some. </s>
<s>  also about a certain broken window. </s>
<s>  what happened when the twins went coasting, how they had a good time in an ice boat, and how they did many other things. </s>
<s>  snoop, the fat, black kitten, played a part in the story also. </s>
<s>  the bobbsey twins were very fond of snoop, and had kept him so many years that i suppose he ought to be called cat, instead of a kitten, now. </s>
<s>  after the first winter's fun, told of in the book that began an account of the doings of the bobbseys, the twins and their parents went to the home of uncle daniel bobbsey, and his wife, aunt sarah, in meadow brook. </s>
<s>  in the book called "the bobbsey twins in the country," i wrote down many of the things that happened during the summer. </s>
<s>  if they had fun going off to the country, taking snoop with them, of course, they had many more good times on arriving at the farm. </s>
<s>  there was a picnic, jolly times in the woods, a fourth of july celebration, and though a midnight scare alarmed them for a time, still they did not mind that. </s>
<s>   though the twins liked the country very much, they soon had a chance to see something of the ocean, and in the third book of the series, called "the bobbsey twins at the seashore," my readers will find out what happened there. </s>
<s>  there was fun on the s and more fun in the water, and once the little ones got lost on an island. </s>
<s>  a great storm came up, and a ship was wrecked, and this gave the twins a chance to see the life savers, those brave men who risk their lives to help others. </s>
<s>  then came closing days at ocean cliff, the home of uncle william and aunt emily minturn at sunset beach. </s>
<s>  school was soon to open, and mr. </s>
<s>  and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey were anxious to get back to their town home, for flossie and freddie were to start regular lessons now, even though it was but in the kindergarten class. </s>
<s>  so goodbyes were said to the ocean, and though dorothy minturn cried a little when her cousins nan and flossie, and bert and freddie, had to leave, still she said she hoped they would come again. </s>
<s>  and so the bobbseys were on their way home in the train when the circus accident happened that brought them to a stop. </s>
<s>  "and so we nearly ran into an elephant, eh?" said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey to the brakeman, who had brought in the news. </s>
<s>  "yes, sir. </s>
<s>  our engineer stopped just in time. </s>
<s> " "if we had hit him we'd gone off the track," said freddy. </s>
<s>  "no, we wouldn't," declared flossie, who seemed bound to start a dispute. </s>
<s>  perhaps she was so tired that she was fretful. </s>
<s>  "say, can't you two stop disputing all the while?" asked bert, in a low voice. </s>
<s>  "you make papa and mamma nervous. </s>
<s> " "well, an elephant is big, anyhow," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "so he is, little fat fireman," said nan, "come and sit with me, and we can see the men catch the monkeys. </s>
<s> " the work of getting the escaped animals back into their cages was going on rapidly. </s>
<s>  some of the passengers went out to watch, but the bobbseys stayed in their seats, mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey thinking this best. </s>
<s>  the catching of the monkeys was the hardest work, but soon even this was accomplished. </s>
<s>  the wait seemed very tiresome when there was nothing more to watch, and mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey looked about for some railroad man of whom he could inquire how much longer delay there would be. </s>
<s>  the conductor came through the car. </s>
<s>  "when will we start?" asked mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "not for some time, i am afraid," spoke the tickettaker. </s>
<s>  "the wreck is a worse one than i thought at first, and some of the cars of the circus train are across the track so we can't get by. </s>
<s>  we may be here two hours yet. </s>
<s> " "that's too bad. </s>
<s>  where are we?" "just outside of whitewood. </s>
<s> " "oh, that's near home!" exclaimed mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "why can't we get out, richard, walk across the fields to the trolley line, and take that home? it won't be far, and we'll be there ever so much quicker. </s>
<s> " "well, we could do that, i suppose," said her husb slowly. </s>
<s>  "that's what a number of passengers did," said the conductor. </s>
<s>  "there's no danger in going out now - all the animals are back in their cages. </s>
<s> " "then that's what we'll do, children," said their father. </s>
<s>  "gather up your things, and we'll take the trolley home. </s>
<s>  the moon is coming up, and it will soon be light. </s>
<s> " "i am hungry," said freddie, fretfully. </s>
<s>  "so am i," added his twin sister. </s>
<s>  "well, i have some crackers and cookies in my bag," replied mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s> " you can eat those on the way. </s>
<s>  nan, go tell dinah that we're going to take a trolley. </s>
<s>  we can each carry something. </s>
<s> " "i'll carry snoop," exclaimed freddie. </s>
<s>  he hurried down the aisle to where the cook was now standing, intending to get the box containing his pet cat. </s>
<s> " "where's snoop, dinah? " he asked. </s>
<s>  "heah he am!" she said, lifting up the slatbox. </s>
<s>  "he ain't made a sound in all dis confusion, nuther. </s>
<s> " the next moment freddie gave a cry of dismay: "snoop's gone!" he wailed. </s>
<s>  "he broke open the box and he is gone! oh, where is snoop?" "ma sakes alive!" cried dinah. </s>
<s>  the box was empty! a hurried search of the car did not bring forth the black pet. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, and some of the passengers, joined in the hunt. </s>
<s>  but there was no snoop, and a slat that had pulled loose from one side of the box showed how he had gotten out. </s>
<s>  "most likely snoop got frightened when the train stopped so suddenly, and broke loose," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "we may find him outside. </s>
<s> " "i - i hope an elephant didn't step on him" said flossie, with a catch in her breath. </s>
<s>  "ohooo! maybe a tiger or a lion has him!" wailed freddie. </s>
<s>  "oh, snoop!" "be quiet, dear, we'll find him for you," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, as she opened her satchel to get out some cookies. </s>
<s>  then she remembered something. </s>
<s>  "freddie, where is that silver cup?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "you had it to get a drink. </s>
<s>  did you give it back to me?" "no, mamma, i - i" "he gave the fat lady a drink from it," spoke flossie, "and she didn't give it back. </s>
<s> " "the train stopped just as she was drinking," went on freddie. </s>
<s>  "i sat down on the floor - hard, and i saw the water spill on her. </s>
<s>  the fat lady has our silver cup! oh, dear!" "and she is gone - and snoop is gone!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "oh! oh!" "is that so - did you let her take your cup, freddie?" asked his papa. </s>
<s>  freddie only nodded. </s>
<s>  he could not speak. </s>
<s>  "that fat lady was with the circus," said one of the men passengers. </s>
<s>   "maybe you can see her outside. </s>
<s> " "i'll look," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, quickly. </s>
<s>  "that cup is too valuable to lose. </s>
<s>  come, children, we'll see if we can't find snoop also, and then we'll take a trolley car for home. </s>
<s> " chapter iii a queer dog papa bobbsey first looked for some of the circus men of whom he might inquire about the fat lady. </s>
<s>  there was much confusion, for a circus wreck is about as bad a kind as can happen, and for some time mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey could find no one who could tell him what he wanted to know. </s>
<s>  meanwhile mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey kept the four children and dinah with her, surrounding their little pile of baggage off to one side of the tracks. </s>
<s>  some of the big torches were still burning, and the full moon was coming up, so that there was plenty of light, even if it was night. </s>
<s>  "oh, but if we could only find snoop!" cried freddie. </s>
<s>  "here, snoop! snoop!" he called. </s>
<s>  "i had much rather find the fat lady, and get back your lovely silver cup," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i hope she hasn't taken it away with her. </s>
<s> " "she had it in her hand when the train, stopped with such a jerk," explained flossie. </s>
<s>  "oh, but mamma, don't you want us to find snoop -  dear snoop?" "of course i do. </s>
<s>  but i want that silver cup very much, too. </s>
<s>  i hope your father finds it. </s>
<s> " "but there never could be another snoop," cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "could there, freddie? and we could get another silver cup. </s>
<s> " "don't be silly," advised bert, rather shortly. </s>
<s>  "oh, don't talk that way to them," said nan. </s>
<s>  "they do love that cat so. </s>
<s>  never mind, flossie and freddie. </s>
<s>  i am sure we'll find him soon. </s>
<s>  here comes papa. </s>
<s> " mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey came back, looking somewhat worried. </s>
<s>  "did you find her?" asked mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey anxiously. </s>
<s>  "no," he replied, with a shake of his head. </s>
<s>  "she was the circus fat lady all right. </s>
<s>  it seems she missed the showtrain, and came on in ours. </s>
<s>    when we stopped she got out, and went up ahead. </s>
<s>  part of the circus train, carrying the performers, was not damaged and that has gone on. </s>
<s>   the fat lady is with that, so one of the men said. </s>
<s> " " very likely, she has carried off our silver cup," exclaimed mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "oh dear! can you find her later, richard?" "i think so. </s>
<s>  but it will take some time. </s>
<s>  the circus is going to danville - that's a hundred miles from here. </s>
<s>  but i will write to the managers there, and ask them to get our cup from the fat lady. </s>
<s> " "but where is snoop?" asked freddie, with much anxiety. </s>
<s>  "i don't know, my dear," answered mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i asked the circus men if they had seen him, but they were too busy to remember. </s>
<s>  he may be running around some where. </s>
<s>  but we can't wait any longer. </s>
<s>  we must get home. </s>
<s>  i'll speak to one of the switchmen, who stay around here, and if they see snoop i'll have them keep him for us. </s>
<s>  we'll come back tomorrow and inquire. </s>
<s> " "but we want snoop now!" exclaimed freddie, fretfully. </s>
<s>  "i am afraid we can't get him," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, gently. </s>
<s>  "come, children, let's go home now, and leave it to papa. </s>
<s>  oh, to think of your lovely silver cup being gone!" "snoop is worse," said flossie, almost crying. </s>
<s>  "i - i am sorry i let the fat lady take the cup," spoke freddie. </s>
<s>  "oh, you meant all right, my dear," said his mamma, "and it was very kind of you. </s>
<s>  but we really ought to start. </s>
<s>  we may miss a trolley. </s>
<s>   come, dinah, can you carry all you have?" "'deed an' i can, mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  but i suah am sorry 'bout dat ar' snoop. </s>
<s> " "oh, it wasn't your fault, dinah," said nan quickly. </s>
<s>  "he is getting to be such a big cat that he can easily push the slats off his box, now. </s>
<s>   we must make it stronger next time. </s>
<s> " flossie and freddie wondered if there would be a "next time," for they feared snoop was gone forever. </s>
<s>  they did not worry so much about the silver cup, valuable as it was. </s>
<s>  with everyone in the little party carrying something, the bobbsey family set off across, the fields toward the distant trolley line that would take them nearly home. </s>
<s>  the moon was well up now, and there was a good path across the fields. </s>
<s>  nan and bert were talking about the wreck, and recalling some of the funny incidents of catching the circus animals. </s>
<s>  flossie and freddie were wondering whether they would ever see their pet cat again. </s>
<s>  they had had him so long that he seemed like one of the family. </s>
<s>  "maybe he ran off and joined the circus," said flossle. </s>
<s>  "maybe," spoke her brother. </s>
<s>  "but he can't do any tricks, so they won't want him in a show. </s>
<s> " "he can so do tricks! he can chase his tail and almost grab it. </s>
<s> " "that isn't a trick. </s>
<s> " "it is so - as much as standing on your head. </s>
<s> " "children - children - i don't know what i'll do with you if you don't stop that constant bickering," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "you must not dispute so. </s>
<s> " "well, mamma, but isn't chasing your tail a trick?" asked flossie. </s>
<s>  "freddie says it isn't. </s>
<s> " "well, it isn't a circus trick, anyhow," declared her brother. </s>
<s>  "i meant a circus trick. </s>
<s> " "well, snoop is a good cat, anyhow," went on flossie, "and i wish we had him back. </s>
<s> " "oh, so do i!" exclaimed freddie, and thus that little dispute ended. </s>
<s>  they were walking along through a little patch of woods now, when bert, who was the last one in line, suddenly called out: "something is coming after us!" "coming after us? what do you mean?" asked nan quickly, as she hurried to her father's side. </s>
<s>  "i mean i have been listening for two or three minutes now, to some animal following after us along the path. </s>
<s>  some big animal, too. </s>
<s> " flossie and freddie both ran back and took hold of their mother's hands. </s>
<s>  "don't scare the children, bert," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, a bit sternly. </s>
<s>  "did you really hear something?" "yes, father. </s>
<s>  it's some animal walking behind us. </s>
<s>  listen and you can hear it your self. </s>
<s> " they all listened. </s>
<s>  it was very quiet. </s>
<s>  then from down the hard dirt path they all heard the "pitpat, pitpat" of the footsteps of some animal. </s>
<s>  it was coming on slowly. </s>
<s>  for a moment mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey thought of the wild animals of the circus. </s>
<s>  in spite of what the men had said perhaps one of the beasts might have escaped from its cage. </s>
<s>  the others in the little party evidently thought the same thing. </s>
<s>  mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey drew her children more closely about her. </s>
<s>  "'deed an' if it's one ob dem elephants," said dinah, "an' if he comes fo' me i'll jab mah hat pin in his long nose - dat's what i will!" "it can't be an elephant," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "one of the big beasts would make more noise than that. </s>
<s>  it may be one of the monkeys - i don't see how they could catch them all - they were so lively and full of mischief. </s>
<s> " "oh, if it's a monkey, may we keep it?" begged flossie. </s>
<s>  "i just love a monkey. </s>
<s> " "mercy, child! what would we do with it around the house?" cried mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "richard, can you see what it is?" mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey peered down the road. </s>
<s>  "i can see something," he said. </s>
<s>  "it's coming nearer. </s>
<s> " "oh dear!" cried nan, trembling with fear. </s>
<s>  just then a bark sounded - a friendly bark. </s>
<s>  "it's a dog!" said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "oh, i am so glad it wasn't an elephant," and she hugged freddie and flossie. </s>
<s>  "pooh! i wasn't afraid!" cried freddie. </s>
<s>  "if it had been an elephant i  - i would give him a cookie, and maybe he would let me ride home on his back. </s>
<s> " the animal barked louder now, and a moment later he came into sight on a moonlit part of the path. </s>
<s>  the children could see that it was a big, shaggy white dog, who wagged his tail in greeting as he walked up to them. </s>
<s>  "oh, what a lovely dog!" cried nan. </s>
<s>  "i wonder where he belongs?" the fine animal came on. </s>
<s>  bert snapped his fingers, boy-fashion. </s>
<s>  instantly the dog stood up on his hind legs and began marching about in a circle on the path. </s>
<s>  "oh, what a queer dog!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "oh i wish he was ours!" chapter iv home in an auto down on his four legs dropped the big white dog, and with another wag of his fluffy tail he came straight for flossie. </s>
<s>  "be careful!" warned mamma bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "he won't hurt her!" declared bert. </s>
<s>  "that's a good dog, anyone can tell that. </s>

<s>  "you never can tell what dogs will do," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "it is best to be careful. </s>
<s> " "i guess he knew what flossie said to him," spoke up freddie. </s>
<s>  "he knows we like dogs. </s>
<s> " the dog barked a little,  coming up to where flossie was, again stood on his hind legs. </s>
<s>  "that's a queer trick," said mr. </s>

<s>  "i guess this dog has been trained. </s>
<s>  he probably belongs around here. </s>
<s> " "i wish he belonged to us," sighed nan. </s>

<s>  "maybe we can keep him if we don't find snoop?" suggested freddie. </s>
<s>  "oh, papa, will you get snoop back?" and freddie's voice sounded as though he was going to cry. </s>
<s>  "yes, yes, of course i will," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey quickly. </s>
<s>  he did not want the children to fret now, with still quite a distance yet to go home, and that in a trolley car. </s>
<s>  there were bundles to carry, weary children to look after, and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey was rather tired also. </s>
<s>  no wonder papa bobbsey thought he had many things to do that night. </s>
<s>  "come along, children," called mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, "it is getting late, and we are only about half way to the trolley. </s>
<s>  oh dear! if that circus had to be wrecked i wish it could have waited until our train passed. </s>
<s> " "are you very tired?" asked her husband. </s>
<s>  "i can take that valise. </s>
<s> " "indeed you'll not. </s>
<s>  you have enough. </s>
<s> " "lemme have it, massa bobbsey," pleaded dinah. </s>
<s>  "i ain't carryin' half enough. </s>

<s> " "nonsense, dinah!" said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbiey. </s>
<s>  "i can manage, and your arms are full. </s>
<s> " "i - i wish she had snoop," said freddie, but he was so interested in watching the queer dog that he half forgot his sorrow over the lost cat. </s>
<s>  the dog seemed to have made great friends with flossie. </s>
<s>  she was patting him on the head now, for the animal, after marching about on his hind legs, was down on all fours again. </s>
<s>  "oh, mamma, he is awful nice!" exclaimed flossie. </s>
<s>  "he is just as gentle, and he is soft, like the little toy lamb i used to have. </s>
<s> " "indeed he does seem to be a gentle dog," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "but come along now. </s>
<s>  don't pet him any more, or he may follow us. </s>
<s>  flossie, and whoever owns him would not like it. </s>
<s>  come on. </s>
<s> " "forward - march!" called freddie, strutting along the moonlit path as much like a soldier as he could imitate, tired as he was. </s>
<s>  the bobbseys and their faithful dinah started off again toward the distant trolley that would take them to their home. </s>
<s>  the dog sat down and looked after them. </s>
<s>  "i - i wish he was ours," said flossie wistfully, waving her hand to the dog. </s>
<s>  the bobbseys had not gone on very far before nan, looking back, called out: "oh, papa, that dog is following us!" "he is?" exclaimed mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "that's queer. </s>
<s>  he must have taken a sudden liking to us. </s>
<s>  but i guess he'll go back where he belongs pretty soon. </s>
<s>  are you getting tired, little fat fireman? and you, my fat fairy?" "oh, no, papa," laughed flossie. </s>
<s>  "i sat down so much in the train that i am glad to stand up now. </s>
<s> " "so am i," said freddie, who made up his mind that he would not say he was tired if his little sister did not. </s>
<s>  and yet, truth to tell, the little fat fireman was very weary. </s>
<s>  on and on went the bobbsey family, and soon bert happened to look back, and gave a whistle of surprise. </s>
<s>  "that dog isn't going home, papa," he said. </s>
<s>  "he is still after us, and look! now he is running. </s>
<s> " they all glanced back on hearing this. </s>
<s>  surely enough the big white dog was running after them, wagging his tail joyfully, and barking from time to time. </s>
<s>  "this will never do!" exclaimed mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "whoever owns him may think we are trying to take him away. </s>
<s>  i'll drive him back. </s>
<s>  go home!  go back, sir!" exclaimed papa bobbsey in stern tones. </s>
<s>  the dog stopped wagging his tail. </s>
<s>  then he sat down on the path, and calmly waited. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey walked toward him. </s>
<s>  "oh, don't - don't whip him, papa!" exclaimed flossie. </s>
<s>  "i don't intend to," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "but i must be stern with him or he will think i am only playing. </s>
<s>  go back!" he cried. </s>
<s>  the dog stretched out on the path, his head down between his fore paws. </s>
<s>  "he - he looks - sad," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "maybe he hasn't any home, papa. </s>
<s> " "oh, of course a valuable dog like that has a home," declared bert. </s>
<s>  "but maybe they didn't treat him kindly, and he is looking for a new one," suggested nan, hopefully. </s>
<s>  "he doesn't seem illtreated," spoke mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "oh, i do wish he would go back, so we could go on. </s>
<s> " mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey pretended to pick up a stone and throw it at the dog, as masters sometimes do when they do not want their dogs to follow them. </s>
<s>  this dog only wagged his tail, as though he thought it the best joke he had ever known. </s>
<s>  "go back! go back, i say!" cried papa bobbsey in a loud voice. </s>
<s>  the dog did not move. </s>
<s>  "i guess he won't follow us any more," went on mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "hurry along now, children. </s>
<s>  we are almost at the trolley. </s>
<s> " he turned away from the dog, who seemed to be asleep now, and the family went on. </s>
<s>  for a minute or two, as nan could tell by looking back, the dog did not follow, but just as the bobbseys were about to make a turn in the path, up jumped the animal and came trotting on after the children and their parents, wagging his tail so fast that it seemed as if it would come loose. </s>
<s>  "is he coming?" asked flossie. </s>
<s>  "he certainly is," answered bert, who was in the rear. </s>
<s>  "i guess he wants us to take him home with us. </s>
<s> " "oh, let's do it!" begged flossie. </s>
<s>  "please, papa," pleaded freddie. </s>
<s>  "we haven't got snoop now, so let us have a dog. </s>
<s>  and i am sure we could teach him to do tricks - he is so smart. </s>
<s> " "and so he is coming after us still!" exclaimed mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "well, well, i don't know what to do," and he came to a stop on the path. </s>
<s>  "couldn't we take him home just for to-night?" asked nan, "and then in the morning we could find out who owns him and return him. </s>
<s> " "oh, please do," begged freddie and flossie, impulsively. </s>
<s>  "but how can we take him on a trolley car?" asked mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "the conductor would not let us. </s>
<s> " "maybe he would - if he was a kind man," suggested freddie. </s>
<s>  "we could tell him how it was, and how we lost our cat. </s>
<s> " "and our silver cup," added flossie. </s>
<s>  "well, certainly the dog doesn't seem to want to go home," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, after he had tried two or three times more to drive the animal back. </s>
<s>  but it would not go. </s>
<s>  "go on a little farther," suggested mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "by the time we get to the trolley he may get tired, and go back. </s>
<s>  and if we want to lose him i think we can, by getting on the car quickly. </s>
<s> " "but we don't want to lose him!" cried freddie. </s>
<s>  "no, no!" said flossie. </s>
<s>  "we want to keep him. </s>
<s>  he can run along behind the trolley car. </s>
<s>  i'll ask the motorman to go slow, papa. </s>
<s> " "my! this has been a mixedup day!" sighed mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i really don't know what to do. </s>
<s> " the dog seemed to think that he was one of the family, now. </s>
<s>  he came up to flossie and freddie and let them pat him. </s>
<s>  his tail kept wagging all the while. </s>
<s>  "well, we'll see what happens where we get to the trolley," decided mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, thinking that there would be the best and only place to get rid of the dog. </s>
<s> " come along, children. </s>
<s> " freddie and flossie came on, the dog between them, and this seemed to suit the fine animal. </s>
<s>  he had found friends, now, he evidently thought. </s>
<s>   mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey wondered why so valuable a dog would leave its home. </s>
<s>  and he was very much puzzled as to what he should do if the children insisted on keeping the animal, and if it came aboard the trolley car. </s>
<s>  "there's the car!" exclaimed bert, as they went around another turn in the path and came to a road. </s>
<s>  down it could be seen the headlight of an approaching trolley, and also the twin lamps of an oncoming automobile. </s>
<s>  "look out for the auto, children!" cried mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  they stood at the side of the road, and as the auto came up the man in it slowed down his machine. </s>
<s>  it was a big car and he was alone in it. </s>
<s>  "well, i declare!" exclaimed the autoist, as his engine stopped. </s>
<s>  "if it isn't the bobbsey family - twins and all! what are you doing here, mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey?" "why, it's mr. </s>
<s>  blake!" exclaimed mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, seeing that the autoist was a neighbor, and a business friend of his. </s>
<s>  "oh, our train was held back by a circus wreck, so we walked across the lots to the car. </s>
<s>  we're homeward bound from the seashore. </s>
<s> " "well, well! a circus wreck, eh? where did you get the dog?" "oh, he followed us," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "and we're going to keep him, too!" exclaimed flossie. </s>
<s>  "and take him in the trolley with us," added her little brother. </s>
<s>  "well, well!" exclaimed mr. </s>
<s>  blake. </s>
<s>  "say, now, i have a better plan than that," he went on. </s>
<s>  "why should you folks go home in a trolley, when i have this big empty auto here? pile in, all of you, and i'll get you there in a jiffy. </s>
<s>  come, dinah, i see you, too. </s>
<s> " "yes, sah, massa blake, i'se heah! can't lose ole dinah!" "but we lost our cat, snoop!" said flossie regretfully. </s>
<s>  "and we nearly ran over an elephant," added freddie, bound that his sister should not tell all the news. </s>
<s>  "well, get in the auto," invited mr. </s>
<s>  blake. </s>
<s>  "do you really mean it?" asked mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "perhaps we are keeping you from going somewhere. </s>
<s> " "indeed not. </s>
<s>  pile in, and you'll soon be home. </s>
<s> " "can we bring the dog, too?" asked flossie. </s>
<s>  "yes, there's plenty of room for the dog," laughed mr. </s>
<s>  blake. </s>
<s>  "lift him in. </s>
<s> " but the strange dog did not need lifting. </s>
<s>  he sprang into the tonneau of the auto as soon as the door was opened. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey lifted in flossie and freddie, and nan and bert followed. </s>
<s>  then in got papa and mamma bobbsey and mr. </s>
<s>  blake started off. </s>
<s>  "this is lovely," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey with a sigh of relief. </s>
<s>  she was more tired than she had thought. </s>
<s>  "it certainly is kind of you, mr. </s>
<s>  blake," said papa bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i am only too glad i happened to meet you. </s>
<s>  are you children comfortable?" "yep!" chorused freddie and flossie. </s>
<s>  "and the dog?" "we're holding him so he won't fall out," explained flossie. </s>
<s>  she and her little brother had the dog between them. </s>
<s>  on went the auto, and with the telling of the adventures of the day the journey seemed very short. </s>
<s>  soon the bobbsey home was reached. </s>
<s>  there were lights in it, for sam, the colored man, had been telephoned to, to have the place opened for the family. </s>
<s>  sam came out on the stoop to greet them and his wife dinah. </s>
<s>  "here we are!" cried papa bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "come, flossie freddie we're home. </s>
<s> " flossie and freddie did not answer. </s>
<s>  they were fast asleep, their heads on the shaggy back of the big dog. </s>
<s>  chapter v snap does tricks "we'll have to carry them in," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, as he looked in the rear of the auto, and saw his two little twins fast asleep on the dog's back. </s>
<s>  "i'll take 'em," said sam kindly. </s>
<s>  "many a time i'se carried 'em in offen de porch when dey falled asleep. </s>
<s>  i'll carry 'em in. </s>
<s> " and he did, first taking flossie, and then freddie. </s>
<s>  then he and dinah brought in the bundles and valises, while nan and bert and mr. </s>
<s>  and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey followed, having bidden goodnight to mr. </s>
<s>  blake, and thanking him for the ride. </s>
<s>  "where - where are we?" asked flossie, rubbing her eyes and looking around the room which she had not seen in some months. </s>
<s>  "an' - an' where's our dog?" demanded freddie. </s>
<s>  "oh, bless your hearts - that dog!" cried mamma bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "sam took him out in the barn. </s>
<s>  you may see him in the morning, if he doesn't run away in the night. </s>
<s> " the twins looked worried over this suggestion, until sam said: "oh, i locked him up good an' proper in a box stall. </s>
<s>  'deed an' i did, mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  he won't get away tonight. </s>
<s> " "that's - good," murmured freddie, and then he fell asleep again. </s>
<s>  soon the little twins were undressed and put to bed. </s>
<s>  nan and bert soon followed, but mr. </s>
<s>  and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey stayed up a little later to talk over certain matters. </s>
<s>  "it's good to be home again," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, as he looked about the rooms of the town house. </s>
<s>  "yes, but we had a delightful summer," spoke his wife, "and the children are so well. </s>
<s>  the country was delightful, and so was the seashore. </s>
<s>  but i think i, too, am glad to be back. </s>
<s>  it will be quite a task, though, to get the children ready for school. </s>
<s>  flossie and freddie will go regularly now, i suppose, and with nan and bert in a higher class, it means plenty of work. </s>
<s> " "i suppose so," said her husband. </s>
<s>  "but dinah is a great help," went on mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, for she did not mean to complain. </s>
<s>  flossie and freddie had tried a few days in the kindergarten class at school, but flossie said she did not like it,  as freddie would not go without her, their parents had taken them both out in the spring. </s>
<s>  "there will be plenty of time to start them in the fall," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, and so it had been arranged. </s>
<s>  and now the four twins were all to attend the same school, which would open in about a week. </s>
<s>  flossie and freddie were both up early the next morning,  scarcely halfdressed, they hurried out to the barn. </s>
<s>  "whar yo' chillers gwine?" demanded dinah, as she prepared to get breakfast. </s>
<s>  "out to see our dog," answered freddie. </s>
<s>  "is sam around?" "yes, he is out dere somewheres, washin' de carriage. </s>
<s>  but don't yo' let dat dog bite yo'. </s>
<s> " "we won't," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "he wouldn't bite anyhow," declared flossie. </s>
<s>  sam opened the box stall for them, and out bounced the big white dog, barking in delight, and almost knocking down the twins, so glad was he to see them. </s>
<s>  "what shall we call him?" asked freddie. </s>
<s>  "maybe we'd better name him snoop, like our cat. </s>
<s>  i guess snoop is gone forever. </s>
<s> " "no, we mustn't call him snoop," said flossie, "for some day our cat might come back, and he would want his own name again. </s>
<s>  we'll call our dog snap, 'cause see how bright his eyes snap. </s>
<s>  then if our cat comes back we'll have snoop and snap. </s>
<s> " "that's a good name," decided freddie, after thinking it over. </s>
<s>  "snoop and snap. </s>
<s>  i wonder how we can make this dog stand on his hind legs like he did before?" "bert snapped his fingers and he did it," suggested flossie. </s>
<s>  "but maybe he'll do it now if you just ask him to. </s>
<s> " freddie tried to snap his fingers, but they were too short and fat. </s>
<s>   then he patted the dog an the head and said: "stand up!" at once the dog, with a bark, did so. </s>
<s>  he sat up on his hind legs and then walked around. </s>
<s>  both the children laughed. </s>
<s>  "i wonder if he can do any other tricks?" asked flossie. </s>
<s>  "i am going to try," said her brother. </s>
<s>  "what trick do you want him to do?" "make him lie down and roll over. </s>
<s> " "all right," spoke freddie. </s>
<s>  "now, snap, lie down and roll over!" he called. </s>
<s>  at once the fine animal did so, and then sprang up with a bark, and a wag of his tail, as much as to ask: "what shall i do next?" "oh, isn't he a fine dog!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "i wonder who taught him those tricks?" "let's see if he can do any more," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "there's a barrel hoop over there. </s>
<s>  maybe he'll jump through it if we hold it up" "oh, let's do it!" cried flossie, as she ran to get the hoop. </s>
<s>  snap barked at the sight of it, and capered about as though he knew just what it was for, and was pleased at the chance to do more of his tricks. </s>
<s>  the hoop was a large one, and freddie alone could not hold it very steady. </s>
<s>  so flossie took hold of one side. </s>
<s>  as soon as they were in position, freddie called: "come on now, snap. </s>
<s>  jump!" snap barked, ran back a little way, turned around and came racing straight for the twins. </s>
<s>  at that moment sam johnson came up running, a stick in his hand. </s>
<s>  "heah! heah!" shouted the colored man, "you let dem chillers alone, dog!  go 'way, i tells yo'!" "that's all right, sam," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "don't scare him. </s>
<s>  he is our new dog snap, and he is going to do a trick," for the colored gardener had supposed the dog was running at flossie and freddie to bite them. </s>
<s>  snap paid no attention to sam, but raced on. </s>
<s>  when a short distance from where flosxie and freddie held the hoop, snap jumped up into the air, and shot straight through the wooden circle, landing quite a way off. </s>
<s>  "mah gracious sakes alive!" gasped sam. </s>
<s>  "dat's a reg'lar circus trick`- at's what it am!" he scratched his head in surprise, and the stick he had picked up, intending to drive away the dog with, stuck straight out. </s>
<s>  in a moment snap raced up, and jumped over the stick. </s>
<s>  "oh, look!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "another trick!" exclaimed freddie. </s>
<s>  "mah gracious goodness!" cried sam. </s>
<s>  "dat suah am wonderful!" snap ran about barking in delight. </s>
<s>  he seemed happy to be doing tricks. </s>
<s>  "let's go tell papa," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "he'll want to know about this. </s>
<s> " "oh, i do hope he lets us keep him," said flossie. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey had not yet gone to his lumber office. </s>
<s>  he listened to what the little twins had to tell them about snap, who lay on the lawn, seeming to listen to his own praises. </s>
<s>  "a trick dog. </s>
<s>  eh?" exclaimed mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i wonder who owns him?" "maybe he escaped from the circus," suggested bert, who came out just then to see how his pigeons were getting along. </s>
<s>  "that's it!" cried mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i wonder i did not think of it before. </s>
<s>   the dog must have escaped from the wrecked circus train, and he followed us, not knowing what else to do. </s>
<s>  that accounts for his tricks. </s>
<s> " "but we can keep him. </s>
<s>  can't we?" begged flossie. </s>
<s>  "hum! i'll have to see about that," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey slowly. </s>
<s>  "i suppose the circus people will want him back, for he must be valuable. </s>
<s>   perhaps some clown trained him. </s>
<s> " "but if we can't have snoop, our cat, we ought to have a dog," asserted freddie. </s>
<s>  "i'll try to get snoop back," said mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i'll have one of my men go down to the place where the wreck was, today, and inquire of the railroad men. </s>
<s>  he may be wandering about there. </s>
<s> " "poor snoop!" said nan, coming out to feed some of her pet chickens, that sam had looked after all summer. </s>
<s>  "and while you are about it," suggested mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, who was on the front porch, "i wish, richard, that you would see if you can locate that fat lady, and get back the children's silver cup. </s>
<s> " "i will," replied mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "i will have to write to them anyhow, about the dog, and at the same time i'll ask about the cup. </s>
<s>  though i don't believe the fat lady meant to keep it. </s>
<s> " "oh, no," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "probably she just held it, in the excitement over the wreck, and she may have left it in the car. </s>
<s>  but please write about it. </s>
<s> " "i will," promised mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, as he started for the office, while the twins gathered about the new dog, who seemed ready to do more tricks. </s>
<s>  chapter vl danny rugg is mean that afternoon a small fire broke out in mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey's lumber yard. </s>
<s>  the alarm bell rang, and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, hearing it, and knowing by the number that the blaze must be near her husband's place of business, came hurrying down stairs. </s>
<s>  "oh, i must go and see how dangerous it is," she said to dinah. </s>
<s>  "it is too bad to have it happen just after mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey comes back from his summer vacation. </s>
<s> " "'deed it am!" cried the fat, colored cook. </s>
<s>  "but maybe it am only a little fire, mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s> " "i am sure i hope so," was the answer. </s>
<s>  as mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey was hurrying down the front walk flossie and freddie saw her. </s>
<s>  "where are you going, mamma?" they called. </s>
<s>  "down to papa's office," she answered. </s>
<s>  "there's a fire near his place, and - " "oh, a fire! then i am going!" cried freddie. </s>
<s>  "fire! fire! ding, dong"!  turn on the water!" and he raced about quite excitedly. </s>
<s>  "oh, i don't know," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, in doubt. </s>
<s>  "where are nan and bert?" she asked. </s>
<s>  "they went down to the lake," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "oh, mamma, do take us to the fire with you. </s>
<s>  we'll bring snap along. </s>
<s> " "sure," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "hi, snap!" he called. </s>
<s>  the trick dog came rushing from the stable, barking and wagging his tail. </s>
<s>  "well, i suppose i might as well take you," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "but you must stay near me. </s>
<s>  we'll leave snap home, though. </s>
<s> " "oh, no!" cried freddie. </s>
<s>  "he might get lost," said mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  that was enough for freddie. </s>
<s>  he did not want the new pet to get lost, so he did not make a fuss when sam came hurrying up to lock snap in the stable. </s>
<s>  poor snap howled, for he wanted very much to go with the children. </s>
<s>  the fire was, as i have said, a small one, in part of the planing mill. </s>
<s>   but the engines puffed away, and spurted water, and this pleased freddie. </s>
<s>  flossie stayed close to her mother, and mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, once she found out that the main lumber yard was not in danger, was ready to come back home. </s>
<s>  but freddie wanted to stay until the fire was wholly out. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey came from his office to give some directions to the firemen, and saw his wife and the two twins. </s>
<s>  then he took charge of them, and led them as close to the blaze as was safe. </s>
<s>  "it will soon be out," he said. </s>
<s>  "it was only some sawdust that got on fire. </s>
<s> " "i wish i could squirt some water!" sighed freddie. </s>
<s>  "what's that? do you want to be a fireman?" asked one of the men in a rubber coat and a big helmet. </s>
<s>  he smiled at mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, whom he knew quite well. </s>
<s>  "yes, i do," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "then come with me, and i'll let you help hold the hose," said the fireman. </s>
<s>  "i'll look after him," he went on, to mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, and she nodded to show that freddie could go. </s>
<s>  what a good time the little fellow had, standing beside a real fireman, and helping throw real water on a real fire! freddie never forgot that. </s>
<s>  of course the fire was almost out, and it was only one of the small hose lines that the fireman let the little fellow help hold,  for all that, freddie was very happy. </s>
<s>  "did you write to the circus people today about our silver cup, and that trick dog?" asked mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey of her husb that night. </s>
<s>  "i declare, i didn't!" he exclaimed. </s>
<s>  "the fire upset me so that it slipped my mind. </s>
<s>  i'll do it the first thing tomorrow. </s>
<s>  there is no special hurry. </s>
<s>  how is the dog, by the way?" "oh, he is just lovely!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  "and i do hope we can keep him forever!" exclaimed freddie. </s>
<s>  "'specially since snoop is gone. </s>
<s> " "did you hear anything about our cat?" asked nan, of her father. </s>
<s>  "no. </s>
<s>  i sent a man to the railroad company, but no stray cat had been found. </s>
<s>  i am afraid snoop is lost, children. </s>
<s> " "oh dear!" cried flossie. </s>
<s>  the next day, having learned from the railroad company where the circus had gone after the wreck, mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey sent a letter to the manager, explaining about the lost silver cup, and the found circus dog. </s>
<s>  he asked that the fat lady be requested to write to him, to let him know if she had taken the cup by accident, and mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey also wanted to know if the circus had lost a trick dog. </s>
<s>  "there!" he exclaimed as he sent the letter to be mailed, "now we'll just have to wait for an answer. </s>
<s> " nan and bert, and flossie and freddie were soon having almost as much fun as they had had at the seashore and in the country. </s>
<s>  their town playmates, who had come back from their vacations, called at the bobbsey home, and made up games and all sorts of sports. </s>
<s>  "for," said grace lavine, with whom nan sometimes played, "school will soon begin, and we want to have all the fun we can until then. </s>
<s> " "let's jump rope," proposed nan. </s>
<s>  "all right," agreed grace. </s>
<s>  "here comes nellie parks, and we'll see who can jump the most. </s>
<s> " "no, you mustn't do that," said nan. </s>
<s>  "don't you remember how you once tried to jump a hundred, and you fainted?" "indeed i do," said grace. </s>
<s>  "i am not going to be so silly as to try that again. </s>
<s>  we'll only jump a little. </s>
<s> " soon nan and her chums were having good time in the yard. </s>
<s>  charley mason, with whom bert sometimes played, came over, and the two boys went for a row on the lake, in bert's boat. </s>
<s>  some little friends of flossie and freddie came over, and they had fun watching snap do tricks. </s>
<s>  for the circus dog, as he had come to be called, seemed to be able to do some new trick each day. </s>
<s>  he could "play dead," and "say his prayers," besides turning a back somersault. </s>
<s>  the little twins, who seemed to claim more share in snap than did nan and bert, did not really know how many tricks their pet could do. </s>
<s>  "maybe you'll have to give him back to the circus," said willie flood, one of freddie's chums. </s>
<s>  "well, if we do, papa may buy him, or get another dog like him," spoke flossie. </s>
<s>  a few days after this, when bert was out in the front yard, watering the grass with a hose, along came danny rugg. </s>
<s>  now danny went to the same school that bert did, but few of the boys and none of the girls, liked danny, because he was often rough, and would hit them or want to fight, or would play mean tricks on them. </s>
<s>  still, sometimes danny behaved himself, and then the boys were glad to have him on their baseball nine as he was a good hitter and thrower, and he could run fast. </s>
<s>  "hello, bert!" exclaimed danny, leaning on the fence. </s>
<s>  "i hear you have a trick circus dog here. </s>
<s> " "who told you?" asked bert, wondering what danny would say next. </s>
<s>  "oh, jack parker. </s>
<s>  he says you found him. </s>
<s> " "i didn't," spoke bert, spraying a bed of geranium flowers. </s>
<s>  "he followed us the night of the circus wreck. </s>
<s> " "well, you took him all the same. </s>
<s>  i know who owns him, too. </s>
<s>  and i am going to tell that you've got him. </s>
<s> " "oh, are you?" asked bert. </s>
<s>  "well, we think he belongs to the circus, and my father has written about it, so you needn't trouble yourself. </s>
<s> " "he doesn't belong to any circus," went on danny. </s>
<s>  "that dog belongs to mr. </s>
<s>  peterson, who lives over in millville. </s>
<s>  he lost a trick dog, and he adverstised for it. </s>
<s>  he is going to give a reward. </s>
<s>  i am going to tell him, and get the money. </s>
<s> " "you can't take our dog away!" cried freddie, coming up just then. </s>
<s>  "don't you dare do it, danny rugg. </s>
<s> " "yes, i will!" exclaimed the mean boy, who often teased the smaller bobbsey twins. </s>
<s>  "you won't have that dog after today. </s>
<s> " "don't mind him, freddie," said bert in a low voice. </s>
<s>  "he is trying to scare you. </s>
<s> " "oh, i am eh?" cried danny. </s>
<s>  "i'll show you what i am trying to do. </s>
<s>  i'll tell on you for keeping a dog that don't belong to you, and you'll be arrested - all of you. </s>
<s> " freddie looked worried, and tears came into his eyes. </s>
<s>  bert saw this, and was angry at danny for being so mean. </s>
<s>  "don't be afraid, freddie," said bert, "look, i'll let you squirt the hose, and you can pretend to be a fireman. </s>
<s> " "oh, fine!" cried freddie, in delight, as he took the nozzle from his older brother. </s>
<s>  just how it happened neither of them could tell, but the stream of water shot right at danny rugg, and wet him all over in a second. </s>
<s>  "hi there!" he cried. </s>
<s>  "stop that! i'll pay you back for that, fred bobbsey," and he jumped over the fence and ran toward the little fellow. </s>
<s>  chapter vii at school freddie saw danny coming, and did the most natural thing in the world. </s>
<s>   he dropped the hose and ran. </s>
<s>  and you know what a hose, with water bursting from the nozzle will sometimes do if you don't hold it just right. </s>
<s>  well, this hose did that. </s>
<s>  it seemed to aim itself straight at danny, and again the rough boy received a charge of water full in the face. </s>
<s>  "ha—ha—here! you quit that!" he gasped. </s>
<s>  "i'll fix you for that!" the water got in his eyes and mouth, and for a moment he could not see. </s>
<s>  but with his handkerchief he soon had his eyes cleared, and then he came running toward bert. </s>
<s>  danny rugg was larger than bert, and stronger,  in addition, was a bullying sort of chap, almost always ready to fight some one smaller than himself. </s>
<s>  but what bert lacked in size and strength he made up in a bold spirit. </s>
<s>   he was not at all afraid of danny, even when the bully came rushing at him. </s>
<s>  bert stood his ground manfully. </s>
<s>  he had taken up the hose where freddie had dropped it, and the water was spurting out in a solid stream. </s>
<s>  freddie, having gotten a safe distance away, now turned and stood looking at danny. </s>
<s>  danny, too, had halted and was fairly glaring at bert, who looked at him a bit anxiously. </s>
<s>  more than once he and the bully had come to blows, and sometimes bert had gotten the best of it. </s>
<s>  still he did not like a fight. </s>
<s>  "i'll get you yet, freddie bobbsey!" cried danny, shaking his fist at the little fellow. </s>
<s>  whereupon freddie turned and ran toward the house. </s>
<s>  danny saw that he could not catch him in time, and so he turned to bert. </s>
<s>  "you put him up to do that - to douse me with water!" cried danny angrily. </s>
<s>  "i did not," said bert quietly. </s>
<s>  "it was just an accident. </s>
<s>  i am sorry. </s>
<s> " "you are not! i say you did that on purpose or you told freddie to, and i am going to pay you back!" "i tell you it was an accident," insisted bert. </s>
<s>  "but if you want to think freddie did it on purpose i can't stop you. </s>
<s> " "well, i am going to hit you just the same," growled danny, and he stepped toward bert. </s>
<s>  "you'd better look out," said bert, with just a little smile. </s>
<s>  "there's still a lot of water in this hose," and he brought the nozzle around in front, ready to squirt on danny if the bad boy should come too near. </s>
<s>  danny came to a stop. </s>
<s>  "don't you dare put any more water on me!" cried the bully. </s>
<s>  "if you do, i'll -" he doubled up his fists and glared at bert. </s>
<s>  "then don't you come any nearer if you don't want to get wet," said bert. </s>
<s>  "this hose might sprinkle you by accident, the same as it did when freddie had it," he added. </s>
<s>  "huh! i know what kind of an accident that was!" spoke danny, with a sneer. </s>
<s>  "you'd better get out of the way," went on bert quietly. </s>
<s>  "i want to sprinkle that flower bed near where you are, and if you're there you might get wet, and it wouldn't my fault. </s>
<s> " "i'll fix you!" growled danny, springing forward. </s>
<s>  bert got ready with the hose, and there might have been more trouble, except that sam, the colored man, came out on the lawn. </s>
<s>  he saw that something out of the ordinary was going on, and breaking into a run he called out: "am anything de mattah, massa bert? am yo' habin' trouble wif anybody?" "well, i guess it's all over now," said bert, as he saw danny turn and walk toward the gate. </s>
<s>  "if yo' need any help, jest remembah dat i am around," spoke sam, with a wide grin that showed his white teeth in his black, but kindly face. </s>
<s>   "i'l1 be right handy by, massa bert, yes, i will!" "all right," said bert, as he went on watering the flowers. </s>
<s>  "huh! you needn't think i am afraid of you!" boasted danny, but he kept on out of the gate just the same. </s>
<s>  sam went back to his work, of weeding the vegetable garden and bert watered the flowers. </s>
<s>  pretty soon freddie came back. </s>
<s>  "did - did danny do anything to you?" the little fellow wanted to know. </s>
<s>  "no, freddie, but the hose did something to him," said bert. </s>
<s>  "oh, did it wet him again?" "that's what it did. </s>
<s> " "ha! ha!" laughed freddie. </s>
<s>  "i wish i would been here to see it, bert. </s>
<s> " "well, why did you run?" "oh, i - i thought maybe - mamma might want me," answered freddie, but bert understood, and smiled. </s>
<s>  then he let freddie finish watering the flowers, after which freddie played he was a fireman, saving houses from burning by means of the hose. </s>
<s>  snap, the trick dog came running out, followed by flossie, who had just been washed and combed, her mother having put a clean dress on her. </s>
<s>  "oh, freddie," said the little girl, "let's make snap do some tricks. </s>
<s>   see if he will jump over the stream of water from the hose. </s>
<s> " "all right," agreed her little brother. </s>
<s>  "i'll squirt the water out straight, and you stand on one side of it and call snap over. </s>
<s>  then he'll jump. </s>
<s> " flossie tried this, but at first the dog did not seem to want to do this particular trick. </s>
<s>  he played soldier, said his prayers, stood on his hind legs, and turned a somersault. </s>
<s>  but he would not jump over the water. </s>
<s>  "come, snap, snap!" called flossie. </s>
<s>  "jump!" snap raced about and barked, and seemed to be having all sorts of fun, but jump he would not until he got ready. </s>
<s>  then, when he did freddie accidentally lowered the nozzle and snap was soaked. </s>
<s>  but the dog did not mind the water in the least. </s>
<s>  in fact he seemed to like it, for the day was warm, and he stood still and let freddie wet him all over. </s>
<s>  then snap rolled about on the lawn, freddie and flossie taking turns sprinkling. </s>
<s>   as might be expected, considerable water got on the two children, and when snap shook himself, as he often did, to get some of the drops off his shaggy coat, he gave flossie and her clean dress a regular shower bath. </s>
<s>  nan, coming from the house saw this. </s>
<s>  she ran up to flossie, who had the hose just then, crying: "flossie bobbsey! oh, you'll get it when mamma sees you! she cleaned you all up and now look at yourself!" "she can't see - there's no looking glass here," said freddie, with a laugh. </s>
<s>  "and you're just as bad!" cried nan. </s>
<s>  "you'd both better go in the house right away, and stop playing with the hose. </s>
<s> " "we're through, anyhow," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "you ought to see snap jump over the water. </s>
<s> " "oh, you children!" cried nan, with a shake of her head. </s>
<s>  she seemed like a little mother to them at times, though she was only four years older. </s>
<s>  mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey was very sorry to see flossie so wet and bedraggled, and said: "you should have known better than to play with water with a clean dress on, flossie. </s>
<s>  now i must punish you. </s>
<s>  you will have to stay in the house for an hour, and so will freddie. </s>
<s> " poor little bobbsey twins! but then it was not a very severe punishment, and really some was needed. </s>
<s>  it was hard when two of their little playmates came and called for them to come out. </s>
<s>  but mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey insisted on the two remaining in until the hour was at an end. </s>
<s>  then, when they had on dry garments, and could go out, there was no one with whom to play. </s>
<s>  "i am not going to squirt the hose ever again," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "neither am i," said his sister. </s>
<s>  "never, never!" snap didn't say anything. </s>
<s>  he lay on the porch asleep, being cooled off after his sport with the water. </s>
<s>  "i - i wish we had our cat, snoop, back," said flossie. </s>
<s>  "then we wouldn't have played in the water. </s>
<s> " "that's so," agreed freddie. </s>
<s>  "i wonder where he can be?" they asked their father that night if any of the railroad men had seen their pet, but he said none had, and added: "i am afraid you'll have to get along without snoop. </s>
<s>  he seems to have disappeared. </s>
<s>   anyhow, you have snap. </s>
<s> " "but some one may come along and claim him," said freddie. </s>
<s>  "that danny rugg says he belongs to mr. </s>
<s>  peterson in millville, father," said bert. </s>
<s>  "well, i'll call mr. </s>
<s>  peterson up on the telephone tomorrow, and find out," spoke mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "that much will be settled, at any rate. </s>
<s> " "did you hear anything from the circus people about the fat lady?" asked mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "yes, but no news," was her husband's answer. </s>
<s>  "the circus has gone to cuba and porto rico for the winter, and i will have to write there. </s>
<s>  it will be some time before we can expect an answer, though, as i suppose the show will be traveling from place to place and mail down there is not like it is up here. </s>
<s>  but we may find the fat lady and the cup some day. </s>
<s> " "and snoop, too," put in nan. </s>
<s>  "yes, snoop too. </s>
<s> " one fact consoled the bobbseys in their trouble over their lost pet and cup. </s>
<s>  this was the answer received by mr. </s>
<s>  bobbsey from mr. </s>
<s>  peterson. </s>
<s>  that gentleman had lost a valuable dog, but it was a small poodle, and unlike big snap. </s>
<s>  so far no one had claimed the trick dog, and it seemed likely that the children could keep him. </s>
<s>  they were very glad about this. </s>
<s>  "oh dear!" exclaimed bert, one afternoon a few days following the fun with the hose, "school begins monday. </s>
<s>  only three more days of vacation!" "i think you have had a long vacation," returned mrs. </s>
<s>  bobbsey, "and if freddie and flossie are going to do such tricks as they did the other day, with the hose, i, for one, shall be glad that you are in school. </s>
<s> " "i like school," said nan. </s>
<s>  "there are lot of new girls coming this term, i hear. </s>
<s> " "any new fellows?" asked bert, more interested. </s>
<s>  "i don't know. </s>
<s>  there is a new teacher in the kindergarten, though, where flossie and freddie will go. </s>
<s>  nellie parks has met her, and says she is awfully nice. </s>
<s> " "that's good," spoke flossie. </s>
<s>  "i like nice teachers. </s>
<s> " "well, i hope you and freddie will get along well," said mamma bobbsey. </s>
<s>  "you are getting older you know, and you must soon begin to study hard. </s>
<s> " "we will," they promised. </s>
<s>  the school bell, next monday morning, called to many rather unwilling children. </s>
<s>  the long vacation was over and class days had begun once more. </s>
<s>  the four bobbseys went off together to the building, which was only a few blocks from their home. </s>
<s>  mr. </s>
<s>  tetlow was the principal, and there were half a dozen lady teachers. </s>
<s>  "hello, nan," greeted grace lavine. </s>
<s>  "may i sit with you this term?" "oh, i was going to ask her," said nellie parks. </s>
<s>  "well, i was first," spoke grace, with a pout. </s>
<s>  "we'll be in the room where there are three seated desks," said nan with a smile. </s>
<s>  "maybe we three can be together. </s>
<s> " "oh, we'll ask teacher!" cried nellie. </s>
<s>  "that will be lovely!" "i am going to sit with freddie," declared flossie. </s>
<s>  "we're to be together - mamma said so. </s>
<s> " "of course, dear," agreed nan. </s>
<s>  "i'll speak to your teacher about it. </s>
<s> " bert was walking in the rear with charley mason, when danny rugg came around a corner. </s>
<s>  "i know what i am going to do to you after school, bert bobbsey!" called the bully. </s>
<s>  "you just wait and see. </s>
<s> " "a11 right - i'll wait" spoke bert quietly. </s>
<s>  "i am not afraid. </s>
<s> " by this time they were at the school, and it was nearly time for the last bell to ring. </s>
<s>  danny went off to join some of his particular chums, shaking his fist at bert as he went. </s>
<s>  chapter viii bert sees something lessons were not very well learned that first day in school, but this is generally the case when the fall term opens after the summer vacation. </s>
<s>  just as were the bobbsey twins, nearly all the other pupils were thinking of what good times they had had in the country, or at the seashore, and in consequence little attention was paid to reading, spelling, arithmetic and geography. </s>
<s>  but principal tetlow and his teachers were prepared for this, and they were sure that, in another day or so, the boys and girls would settle down and do good owrk  pay a trademark license fee to the project of 20% of the   net profits you derive calculated using the method you   already use to calculate your applicable taxes. </s>
<s>  if you   don't derive profits, no royalty is due. </s>
<s>  royalties are   payable to "project gutenberg association/carnegie-mellon   university" within the 60 days following each   date you prepare  since the monster had broken his fast. </s>
<s>   as was natural enough, his appetite had grown to be enormous, and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had just eaten up. </s>
<s>  when he caught sight of cadmus, therefore, he set up another abominable hiss, and flung back his immense jaws, until his mouth looked like a great red cavern, at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his last victim, whom he had hardly had time to swallow. </s>
<s>  but cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragon's jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth. </s>
<s>  drawing his sword, he rushed at the monster, and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth. </s>
<s>  this bold method of attacking him took the dragon by surprise. </s>
<s>  for, in fact, cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat, that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him, nor do him the least harm in the world. </s>
<s>  thus, though the struggle was a tremendous one, and though the dragon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail, yet, as cadmus was all the while slashing and stabbing at his very vitals, it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away. </s>
<s>  he had not gone his length, however, when the brave cadmus gave him a sword thrust that finished the battle. </s>
<s>  and creeping out of the gateway of the creature's jaws, there he beheld him still wriggling his vast bulk, although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child. </s>
<s>  but do not you suppose that it made cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor, friendly people, who had followed the cow along with him? it seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved, or to see them perish in one way or another. </s>
<s>  and here he was, after all his toils and troubles, in a solitary place, with not a single human being to help him build a hut. </s>
<s>  "what shall i do?" cried he aloud. </s>
<s>  "it were better for me to have been devoured by the dragon, as my poor companions were. </s>
<s> " "cadmus," said a voice but whether it came from above or below him, or whether it spoke within his own breast, the young man could not tell--"cadmus, pluck out the dragon's teeth, and plant them in the earth. </s>
<s> " this was a strange thing to do. </s>
<s>  nor was it very easy, i should imagine, to dig out all those deep-rooted fangs from the dead dragon's jaws. </s>
<s>  but cadmus toiled and tugged, and after pounding the monstrous head almost to pieces with a great stone, he at last collected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two. </s>
<s>  the next thing was to plant them. </s>
<s>  this, likewise, was a tedious piece of work, especially as cadmus was already exhausted with killing the dragon and knocking his head to pieces, and had nothing to dig the earth with, that i know of, unless it were his sword blade. </s>
<s>  finally, however, a sufficiently large tract oœ ground was turned up, and sown with this new kind of seed. </s>
<s>  although half of the dragon's teeth still remained to be planted some other day. </s>
<s>  cadmus, quite out of breath, stood leaning upon his sword, and wondering what was to happen next. </s>
<s>  he had waited but a few moments, when he began to see a sight, which was as great a marvel as the most marvelous thing i ever told you about. </s>
<s>  the sun was shining slantwise over the field, and showed all the moist, dark soil just like any other newly-planted piece of ground. </s>
<s>  all at once, cadmus fancied he saw something glisten very brightly, first at one spot, then at another, and then at a hundred and a thousand spots together. </s>
<s>  soon he perceived them to be the steel heads of spears, sprouting up everywhere like so many stalks of grain, and continually growing taller and taller. </s>
<s>  next appeared a vast number of bright sword blades, thrusting themselves up in the same way. </s>
<s>  a moment afterwards, the whole surface of the ground was broken by a multitude of polished brass helmets, coming up like a crop of enormous beans. </s>
<s>  so rapidly did they grow, that cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one. </s>
<s>  in short, before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was, he beheld an abundant harvest of what looked like human beings, armed with helmets and breastplates, shields, swords, and spears. </s>
<s>  and before they were well out of the earth, they brandished their weapons, and clashed them one against another, seeming to think, little while as they had yet lived, that they had wasted too much of life without a battle. </s>
<s>  every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief. </s>
<s>  up sprouted also a great many trumpeters. </s>
<s>  and with the first breath that they drew, they put their brazen trumpets to their lips, and sounded a tremendous and ear-shattering blast, so that the whole space, just now so quiet and solitary, reverberated with the clash and clang of arms, the bray of warlike music, and the shouts of angry men. </s>
<s>  so enraged did they all look, that cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword. </s>
<s>  how fortunate would it be for a great conqueror, if he could get a bushel of the dragon's teeth to sow! "cadmus," said the same voice which he had before heard, "throw a stone into the midst of the armed men. </s>
<s> " so cadmus seized a large stone, and flinging it into the middle of the earth army, saw it strike the breastplate of a gigantic and fierce-looking warrior. </s>
<s>  immediately on feeling the blow, he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had struck him. </s>
<s>   uplifting his weapon, he smote his next neighbor a blow that cleft his helmet asunder, and stretched him on the ground. </s>
<s>  in an instant, those nearest the fallen warrior began to strike at one another with their swords, and stab with their spears. </s>
<s>  the confusion spread wider and wider. </s>
<s>  each man smote down his brother, and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory. </s>
<s>  the trumpeters, all the while, blew their blasts shriller and shriller. </s>
<s>  each soldier shouted a battle cry, and often fell with it on his lips. </s>
<s>  it was the strangest spectacle of causeless wrath, and of mischief for no good end, that had ever been witnessed. </s>
<s>   after all, it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought, in which men have slain their brothers with just as little reason as these children of the dragon's teeth. </s>
<s>  it ought to be considered, too, that the dragon people were made for nothing else. </s>
<s>  whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another. </s>
<s>  well, this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off. </s>
<s>  of all the thousands that began the fight, there were only five left standing. </s>
<s>  these now rushed from different parts of the field,  meeting in the middle of it, clashed their swords, and struck at each other's hearts as fiercely as ever. </s>
<s>  "cadmus," said the voice again, "bid those five warriors sheathe their swords. </s>
<s>  they will help you to build the city. </s>
<s> " without hesitating an instant, cadmus stepped forward, with the aspect of a king and a leader, and extending his drawn sword amongst them, spoke to the warriors in a stern and commanding voice. </s>
<s>  "sheathe your weapons!" said he. </s>
<s>  and forthwith, feeling themselves bound to obey him, the five remaining sons of the dragon's teeth made him a military salute with their swords, returned them to the scabbards, and stood before cadmus in a rank, eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain, while awaiting the word of command. </s>
<s>  these five men had probably sprung from the biggest of the dragon's teeth, and were the boldest and strongest of the whole army. </s>
<s>  they were almost giants indeed, and had good need to be so, else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight. </s>
<s>  they still had a very furious look,  if cadmus happened to glance aside, would glare at one another, with fire flashing out of their eyes. </s>
<s>  it was strange, too, to observe how the earth, out of which they had so lately grown, was incrusted, here and there, on their bright breastplates, and even, begrimed their faces. </s>
<s>  just as you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots, when pulled out of their native soil. </s>
<s>  cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men, or some odd kind of vegetable. </s>
<s>  although, on the whole, he concluded that there was human nature in them, because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons, and so ready to shed blood. </s>
<s>  they looked him earnestly in the face, waiting for his next order, and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another, all over the wide world. </s>
<s>  but cadmus was wiser than these earth-born creatures, with the dragon's fierceness in them, and knew better how to use their strength and hardihood. </s>
<s>  "come!" said he. </s>
<s>  "you are sturdy fellows. </s>
<s>  make yourselves useful! quarry some stones with those great swords of yours, and help me to build a city. </s>
<s> " the five soldiers grumbled a little, and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities, not to build them up. </s>
<s>  but cadmus looked at them with a stern eye, and spoke to them in a tone of authority, so that they knew him for their master, and never again thought of disobeying his commands. </s>
<s>  they set to work in good earnest, and toiled so diligently, that, in a very short time, a city began to make its appearance. </s>
<s>  at first, to be sure, the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition. </s>
<s>  like savage beasts, they would doubtless have done one another a mischief, if cadmus had not kept watch over them, and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts, when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes. </s>
<s>   in course of time, they got accustomed to honest labor, and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living at peace, and doing good to one's neighbor, than in striking at him with a two-edged sword. </s>
<s>  it may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earth-begrimed warriors, who sprang from the dragon's teeth. </s>
<s>  and now the city was built, and there was a home in it for each of the workmen. </s>
<s>  but the palace of cadmus was not yet erected, because they had left it till the last, meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture, and make it very commodious, as well as stately and beautiful. </s>
<s>  after finishing the rest of their labors, they all went to bed betimes, in order to rise in the gray of the morning, and get at least the foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall. </s>
<s>   when cadmus arose, and took his way towards the site where the palace was to be built, followed by his five sturdy workmen marching all in a row, what do you think he saw? what should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world. </s>
<s>  it was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stone, and rose high into the air, with a splendid dome and a portico along the front, and carved pillars, and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king. </s>
<s>  it had grown up out of the earth in almost as short a time as it had taken the armed host to spring from the dragon's teeth. </s>
<s>  and what made the matter more strange, no seed of this stately edifice ever had been planted. </s>
<s>  when the five workmen beheld the dome, with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious, they gave a great shout. </s>
<s>  "long live king cadmus," they cried, "in his beautiful palace. </s>
<s> " and the new king, with his five faithful followers at his heels, shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank  "oh!" said graham, and became quiet. </s>
<s>  it was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar dress knew what they were about. </s>
<s>  yet they were odd and the room was odd. </s>
<s>  it seemed he was in some newly established place. </s>
<s>  he had a sudden flash of suspicion. </s>
<s>  surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition! if it was he would give warming a piece of his mind. </s>
<s>  but it scarcely had that character. </s>
<s>  and in a place of public exhibition he would not have discovered himself naked. </s>
<s>  then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened. </s>
<s>  there was no perceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge. </s>
<s>  abruptly he knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval. </s>
<s>  as if by some processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that peered into his. </s>
<s>  he looked at them strangely, full of intense emotion. </s>
<s>  it seemed they read his eyes. </s>
<s>  he framed his lips to speak and could not. </s>
<s>  a queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the moment of his discovery. </s>
<s>  he looked at his bare feet, regarding then silently. </s>
<s>  his impulse to speak passed. </s>
<s>  he was trembling exceedingly. </s>
<s>  they gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty taste, and the assurance of returning strength grew. </s>
<s>  "that--that makes me feel better," he said hoarsely, and there were murmurs of respectful approval. </s>
<s>  he knew now quite clearly. </s>
<s>  he made to speak again, and again he could not. </s>
<s>  he pressed his throat and tried a third time. </s>
<s>  "how long? " he asked in a level voice. </s>
<s>  "how long have i been asleep? " "some considerable time," said the flaxen-bearded man, glancing quickly at the others. </s>
<s>  "how long? " "a very long time. </s>
<s> " "yes--yes," said graham, suddenly testy. </s>
<s>  "but i want-- is it--it is--some years? many years? there was something--i forget what. </s>
<s>  i feel-- confused. </s>
<s>  but you--" he sobbed. </s>
<s>  "you need not fence with me. </s>
<s>  how long--?" he stopped, breathing irregularly. </s>
<s>  he squeezed his eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer. </s>
<s>  they spoke in undertones. </s>
<s>  "five or six?" he asked faintly. </s>
<s>  "more?" "very much more than that. </s>
<s> " "morel " "more. </s>
<s> " he looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles of his face. </s>
<s>  he looked his question. </s>
<s>  "many years," said the man with the red beard. </s>
<s>  graham struggled into a sitting position. </s>
<s>  he wiped a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand. </s>
<s>  "many years!" he repeated. </s>
<s>  he shut his eyes tight, opened them, and sat looking about him, from one unfamiliar thing to another. </s>
<s>  "how many years?" he asked. </s>
<s>  "you must be prepared to be surprised. </s>
<s> " "well? " "more than a gross of years. </s>
<s> " he was irritated at the strange word. </s>
<s> " more than a __what__?" two of them spoke together. </s>
<s>  some quick remarks that were made about "decimal" he did not catch. </s>
<s>  "how long did you say? " asked graham. </s>
<s>  "how long? don't look like that. </s>
<s>  tell me. </s>
<s> " among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: "more than a couple of centuries. </s>
<s> " __"whats?"__ he cried, turning on the youth who he thought had spoken. </s>
<s>  "who says--? what was that? a couple of centuries!" "yes," said the man with the red beard. </s>
<s>  "two hundred years. </s>
<s> " graham repeated the words. </s>
<s>  he had been prepared to hear of a vast repose, and yet these concrete centuries defeated him. </s>
<s>  "two hundred years," he said again, with the figure of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind. </s>
<s>  and then, "oh, but--!" they said nothing. </s>
<s>  "you--did you say--? " "two hundred years. </s>
<s>  two centuries of years," said the man with the red beard. </s>
<s>  there was a pause. </s>
<s>  graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had heard was indeed true. </s>
<s>  "but it can't be," he said querulously. </s>
<s>  "i am dreaming. </s>
<s>  trances. </s>
<s>  trances don't last. </s>
<s>  that is not right--this is a joke you have played upon me! tell me--some days ago, perhaps, i was walking along the coast of cornwall--? " his voice failed him. </s>
<s>  the man with the flaxen beard hesitated. </s>
<s>  "i am not very strong in history, sir," he said weakly, and glanced at the others. </s>
<s>  "that was it, sir," said the youngster. </s>
<s>  "boscastle, in the old duchy of cornwall--it's in the southwest country beyond the dairy meadows. </s>
<s>  there is a house there still. </s>
<s>  i have been there. </s>
<s> " "boscastle!" graham turned his eyes to the youngster. </s>
<s>  "that was it--boscastle. </s>
<s>  little boscastle. </s>
<s>  i fell asleep--somewhere there. </s>
<s>  i don't exactly remember. </s>
<s>  i don't exactly remember. </s>
<s> " he pressed his brows and whispered," more than two hundred years!"        i he began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was cold within him. </s>
<s>  "but if it is two hundred years, every soul i know, every human being that ever i saw or spoke to before i went to sleep, must be dead. </s>
<s> " they did not answer him. </s>
<s>  "the queen and the royal family, her ministers, of church and state. </s>
<s>  high and low, rich and poor, one with another--" "is there england still?" "that's a comfort! is there london?" e "this __is__ london, eh? and you are my assistant-- custodian. </s>
<s>  assistant-custodian. </s>
<s>  and these--? eh? assistant-custodians to?" he sat with a gaunt stare on his face. </s>
<s>  "but why am i here? no! don't talk. </s>
<s>  be quiet. </s>
<s>  let me--" he sat silent, rubbed his eyes,  uncovering them, found another little glass of pinkish fluid held towards him. </s>
<s>  he took the dose. </s>
<s>  it was almost immediately sustaining. </s>
<s>  directly he had taken it he began to weep naturally and refreshingly. </s>
<s>  presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears, a little foolishly. </s>
<s>  "but--two-- hun--dred--years ! " he said. </s>
<s>  he grimaced hysterically and covered up his face again. </s>
<s>  after a space he grew calm. </s>
<s>  he sat up, his hands hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same attitude in which isbister had found him on the cliff at pentargen. </s>
<s>  his attention was attracted by a thick domineering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage. </s>
<s>  "what are you doing? why was i not warned? surely you could tell? someone will suffer for this. </s>
<s>  the man must be kept quiet. </s>
<s>  are the doorways closed? all the doorways? he must be kept perfectly quiet. </s>
<s>  he must not be told. </s>
<s>  has he been told anything?" the man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and graham looking over his shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and thickset beardless man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. </s>
<s>  very thick black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression. </s>
<s>  he scowled momentarily at graham and then his regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard. </s>
<s>  "these others," he said in a voice of extreme irritation. </s>
<s>  "you had better go. </s>
<s> " "go? " said the red-bearded man. </s>
<s>  "certainly--go now. </s>
<s>  but see the doorways are closed as you go. </s>
<s> " the two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance at graham, and instead of going through the archway as he expected, walked straight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway. </s>
<s>  and then came a strange thing. </s>
<s>  a long strip of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap, hung over the two retreating men and fell again, and immediately graham was alone with the new comer and the purple-robed man with the flaxen beard. </s>
<s>  for a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of graham, but proceeded to interrogate the other--obviously his subordinate--upon the treatment of their charge. </s>
<s>  he spoke clearly, but in phrases only partially intelligible to graham. </s>
<s>  the awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him. </s>
<s>  he was evidently profoundly excited. </s>
<s>  "you must not confuse his mind by telling him things," he repeated again and again. </s>
<s>  "you must not confuse his mind. </s>
<s> " his questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression. </s>
<s>  "feel queer? " he asked. </s>
<s>  "very. </s>
<s> " "the world, what you see of it, seems strange to you? " "i suppose i have to live in it, strange as it seems. </s>
<s> " "i suppose so, now. </s>
<s> " "in the first place, hadn't i better have some clothes? " "they--" said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxen-bearded man met his eye and went away. </s>
<s>  "you will very speedily have clothes," said the thickset man. </s>
<s>  "is it true indeed, that i have been asleep two hundred--?" asked graham. </s>
<s>  "they have told you that, have they? two hundred and three, as a matter of fact. </s>
<s> " graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed mouth. </s>
<s>  he sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, "is there a mill or dynamo near here?" he did not wait for an answer. </s>
<s>  "things have changed tremendously, i suppose?" he said. </s>
<s>  "what is that shouting? " he asked abruptly. </s>
<s>  "nothing," said the thickset man impatiently. </s>
<s>  "it's people. </s>
<s>  you'll understand better later--perhaps. </s>
<s>  as you say, things have changed. </s>
<s> " he spoke shortly, his brows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man trying to decide in an emergency. </s>
<s>  "we must get you clothes and so forth, at any rate. </s>
<s>  better wait here until some can come. </s>
<s>  no one will come near you. </s>
<s>  you want shaving. </s>
<s> " graham rubbed his chin. </s>
<s>  the man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly, listened for a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried off through the archway towards the balcony. </s>
<s>  the tumult of shouting grew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened also. </s>
<s>  he cursed suddenly under his breath, and turned his eyes upon graham with an unfriendly expression. </s>
<s>  it was a surge of many voices, rising and falling, shouting and screaming, and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of dry sticks. </s>
<s>  graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult. </s>
<s>  then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. </s>
<s>  for a time he doubted his ears. </s>
<s>  but surely these were the words: " how us the sleeper! show us the sleeper!" the thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway. </s>
<s>  "wild! " he cried, "how do they know? do they know? or is it guessing? " there was perhaps an answer. </s>
<s>  "i can't come," said the thickset man. </s>
<s>  "i have __him__ to see to. </s>
<s>  but shout from the balcony. </s>
<s> " there was an inaudible reply. </s>
<s>  "say he is not awake. </s>
<s>  anything! i leave it to you. </s>
<s> " he came hurrying back to graham. </s>
<s>  "you must have clothes at once," he said. </s>
<s>  "you cannot stop here--and it will be impossible to--" he rushed away, graham shouting unanswered questions after him. </s>
<s>  in a moment he was back. </s>
<s>  "i can't tell you what is happening. </s>
<s>  it is too complex to explain. </s>
<s>  in a moment you shall have your clothes made. </s>
<s>  yes--in a moment. </s>
<s>  and then i can take you away from here. </s>
<s>  you will find out our troubles soon enough. </s>
<s> " "but those voices. </s>
<s>  they were shouting--?" "something about the sleeper--that's you. </s>
<s>  they have some twisted idea. </s>
<s>  i don't know what it is. </s>
<s>  i know nothing. </s>
<s> " a shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote noises, and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room. </s>
<s>  he listened for a moment, regarding a ball of crystal, nodded, and said a few indistinct words. </s>
<s>  then he walked to the wall through which the two men had vanished. </s>
<s>  it rolled up again like a curtain, and he stood waiting. </s>
<s>  graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the restoratives had given him. </s>
<s>  he thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the other. </s>
<s>  his head no longer swam. </s>
<s>  he could scarcely credit his rapid recovery. </s>
<s>  he sat feeling his limbs. </s>
<s>  the man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did so the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man, and a lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a tightly-fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein. </s>
<s>  "this is the tailor," said the thickset man with an introductory gesture. </s>
<s> " it will never do for you to wear that black. </s>
<s>  i cannot understand how it got here. </s>
<s>  but i shall. </s>
<s>  i shall. </s>
<s>  you will be as rapid as possible? " he said to the tailor. </s>
<s>  the man in green bowed,  advancing, seated himself by graham on the bed. </s>
<s>  his manner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity. </s>
<s>  "you will find the fashions altered, sire," he said. </s>
<s>  he glanced from under his brows at the thickset man. </s>
<s>  , he opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his knees. </s>
<s>  "you lived, sire, in a period essentially cylindrical-- the victorian. </s>
<s>  with a tendency to the hemisphere in hats. </s>
<s>  circular curves always. </s>
<s>  now--" he flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of a keyless watch, whirled the knob, and behold--a little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial, walking and turning. </s>
<s>  the tailor caught up a pattern of bluish white satin. </s>
<s>  "that is my conception of your immediate treatment," he said. </s>
<s>  the thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of graham. </s>
<s>  "we have very little time," he said. </s>
<s>  "trust me," said the tailor. </s>
<s>  "my machine follows. </s>
<s>  what do you think of this? " "what is that?" asked the man from the nineteenth century. </s>
<s>  "in your days they showed you a fashion-plate," said the tailor," but this is our modern development see here. </s>
<s> " the little figure repeated its evolutions, but in a different costume. </s>
<s>  "or this," and with a click another small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to the dial. </s>
<s>  the tailor was very quick in his movements, and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these things. </s>
<s>  it rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with features of the chinese type, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with a complicated machine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the room. </s>
<s>  incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, graham was invited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some instructions to the crop-haired lad, who answered in guttural tones and with words graham did not recognise. </s>
<s>  the boy then went to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in the corner, and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in little discs, pulling them out until the discs were flat against the body of graham, one at each shoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so forth, so that at last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon his body and limbs. </s>
<s>  at the same time, some other person entered the room by the lift, behind graham. </s>
<s>  the tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint-sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine, and in another moment he was knocking up the levers and graham was released. </s>
<s>  the tailor replaced his cloak of black, and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some refreshing fluid. </s>
<s>  graham saw over the rim of the glass a pale-faced young man regarding him with a singular fixity. </s>
<s>  the thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned and went through the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of a distant crowd still came in gusts and cadences. </s>
<s>  the cropheaded lad handed the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine. </s>
<s>  then they ran the entire thing on its easy, noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall. </s>
<s>  they made some connexion and the machine became energetic and swift. </s>
<s>  "what is that doing?" asked graham, pointing with the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer. </s>
<s>  " is that-- some sort of force--laid on? " "yes," said the man with the flaxen beard. </s>
<s>  "who is that?" he indicated the archway behind him. </s>
<s>  the man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered in an undertone, "he is howard, your chief guardian. </s>
<s>  you see, sire,--it's a little difficult to explain. </s>
<s>  the council appoints a guardian and assistants. </s>
<s>  this hall has under certain restrictions been public. </s>
<s>  in order that people might satisfy themselves. </s>
<s>  we have barred the doorways for the first time. </s>
<s>  but i think--if you don't mind, i will leave him to explain. </s>
<s> " "odd" said graham. </s>
<s>  " guardian? council?" then turning his back on the new comer, he asked in an undertone, "why is this man glaring at me? is he a mesmerist? " "mesmerist! he is a capillotomist. </s>
<s> " "capillotomist!" "yes--one of the chief. </s>
<s>  his yearly fee is sixdoz lions. </s>
<s> " it sounded sheer nonsense. </s>
<s>  graham snatched at the last phrase with an unsteady mind. </s>
<s>  "sixdoz lions?" he said. </s>
<s>  "didn't you have lions? i suppose not. </s>
<s>  you had the old pounds? they are our monetary units. </s>
<s> " "but what was that you said--sixdoz? " "yes. </s>
<s>  six dozen, sire. </s>
<s>  of course things, even these little things, have altered. </s>
<s>  you lived in the days of the decimal system, the arab system--tens, and little hundreds and thousands. </s>
<s>  we have eleven numerals now. </s>
<s>  we have single figures for both ten and eleven, two figures for a dozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross, a great hundred, you know, a dozen gross a doz and a dozand dozand a myriad. </s>
<s>  very simple?" "i suppose so," said graham. </s>
<s>  "but about this cap--what was it? " the man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder. </s>
<s>  "here are your clothes!" he said. </s>
<s>  graham turned round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow smiling, and holding some palpably new garments over his arm. </s>
<s>  the crop-headed boy, by means of one finger, was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had arrived. </s>
<s>  graham stared at the completed suit. </s>
<s>  "you don't mean to say--!" "just made," said the tailor. </s>
<s>  he dropped the garments at the feet of graham, walked to the bed on which graham had so recently been iying, flung out the translucent mattress, and turned up the looking glass. </s>
<s>  as he did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner. </s>
<s>  the man with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by the archway. </s>
<s>  the tailor was assisting graham into a dark purple combination garment, stockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the balcony. </s>
<s>  they began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing had an unmistakable quality of anxiety. </s>
<s>  over the purple under-garment came a i complex but graceful garment of bluish white, and i graham was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced, unshaven and shaggy still, but at least naked no longer, and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful. </s>
<s>  "i must shave," he said regarding himself in the glass. </s>
<s>  "in a moment," said howard. </s>
<s>  the persistent stare ceased. </s>
<s>  the young man closed his eyes, reopened them, and with a lean hand extended, advanced on graham. </s>
<s>  then he stopped, with his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about him. </s>
<s>  "a seat," said howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind graham. </s>
<s>  "sit down, please," said howard. </s>
<s>  graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wildeyed man he saw the glint of steel. </s>
<s>  "don't you underst sire?" cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurried politeness. </s>
<s>  "he is going to cut your hair. </s>
<s> " "oh!" cried graham enlightened. </s>
<s>  "but you called him-- "a capillotomist--precisely ! he is one of the finest artists in the world. </s>
<s> " graham sat down abruptly. </s>
<s>  the flaxen-bearded man disappeared. </s>
<s>  the capillotomist came forward with graceful gestures, examined graham's ears and surveyed him, felt the back of his head, and would have sat down again to regard him but for howard's audible impatience. </s>
<s>  forthwith with rapid movements and a succession of deftly handled implements he shaved graham's chin, clipped his moustache, and cut and arranged his hair. </s>
<s>  all this he did without a word, with something of the rapt air of a poet inspired. </s>
<s>  and as soon as he had finished graham was handed a pair of shoes. </s>
<s>  suddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a piece of machinery in the corner--"at once--at once. </s>
<s>  the people know all over the city. </s>
<s>  work is being stopped. </s>
<s>  work is being stopped. </s>
<s>  wait for nothing, but come. </s>
<s> " this shout appeared to perturb howard exceedingly. </s>
<s>  by his gestures it seemed to graham that he hesitated between two directions. </s>
<s>  abruptly he went towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the little crystal ball. </s>
<s>  as he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the archway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound, roared as if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding swiftly. </s>
<s>  it drew graham after it with an irresistible attraction. </s>
<s>  he glanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse. </s>
<s>  in two strides he was down the steps and in the passage,  in a score he was out upon the balcony upon which | the three men had been standing. </s>
<s>  chapter v the moving ways he went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. </s>
<s>  an exclamation of surprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number of people came from the spacious area below. </s>
<s>  his first impression was of overwhelming architecture. </s>
<s>  the place into which he looked was an aisle of titanic buildings, curving spaciously in either direction. </s>
<s>  overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material shut out the sky. </s>
<s>  gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down through the girders and wires. </s>
<s>  here and there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. </s>
<s>  a cliff of edifice hung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and the opposite facade was grey and dim and broken by great archings, circular perforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vast windows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief. </s>
<s>  athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering. </s>
<s>  here and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened, and drooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the opposite side of the space, and even as graham noted these a remote and tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention. </s>
<s>  this little figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher fastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward from a little ledge of masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent from the line. </s>
<s>  then suddenly, with a swoop that sent graham's heart into his mouth, this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round opening on the hither side of the way. </s>
<s>  graham had been looking up as he came out upon the balcony, and the things he saw above and opposed to him had at first seized his attention to the exclusion of anything else. </s>
<s>  then suddenly he discovered the roadway! it was not a roadway at all, as graham understood such things, for in the nineteenth century the only roads and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling rivulets of vehicles between narrow footways. </s>
<s>  but this roadway was three hundred feet across, and it moved. </s>
<s>  it moved, all save the middle, the lowest part. </s>
<s>  for a moment, the motion dazzled his mind. </s>
<s>  then he understood. </s>
<s>  under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to graham's right, an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century express train, an endless platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curvatures of the street. </s>
<s>  upon it were seats, and here and there little kiosks, but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might be therein. </s>
<s>  from this nearest and swiftest platform a series of others descended to the centre of the space. </s>
<s>  each moved to the right, each perceptibly slower than the one above it, but the difference in pace was small enough to permit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent, and so walk uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless middle way. </s>
<s>  beyond this middle way was another series of endless platforms rushing with varying pace to graham's left. </s>
<s>  and seated in crowds upon the two widest and swiftest platforms, or stepping from one to another down the steps, or swarming over the central space, was an innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of people. </s>
<s>  "you must not stop here," shouted howard suddenly at his side. </s>
<s>  "you must come away at once. </s>
<s> " graham made no answer. </s>
<s>  he heard without hearing. </s>
<s>  the platforms ran with a roar and the people were shouting. </s>
<s>  he perceived women and girls with flowing hair, beautifully robed, with bands crossing between the breasts. </s>
<s>  these first came out of the confusion. </s>
<s>  then he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume was the pale blue that the tailor's boy had worn. </s>
<s>  he became aware of cries of "the sleeper. </s>
<s>  what has happened to the sleeper?" and it seemed as though the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of human faces, and then still more thickly. </s>
<s>  he saw pointing fingers. </s>
<s>  he perceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade just opposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blue-clad people. </s>
<s>  some sort of struggle had sprung into life. </s>
<s>  people seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on either side, and carried away against their will. </s>
<s>  they would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick of the confusion, and run back towards the conflict. </s>
<s>  "it is the sleeper. </s>
<s>  verily it is the sleeper," shouted voices. </s>
<s>  "that is never the sleeper," shouted others. </s>
<s>  more and more faces were turned to him. </s>
<s>  at the intervals along this central area graham noted openings, pits, apparently the heads of staircases going down with people ascending out of them and descending into them. </s>
<s>  the struggle it seemed centred about the one of these nearest to him. </s>
<s>  people were running down the moving platforms to this, leaping dexterously from platform to platform. </s>
<s>  the clustering people on the higher platforms seemed to divide their interest between this point and the balcony. </s>
<s>  a number of sturdy little figures clad in a uniform of bright red, and working methodically together, were employed it seemed in preventing access to this descending staircase. </s>
<s>  about them a crowd was rapidly accumulating. </s>
<s>  their brilliant colour contrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their antagonists, for the struggle was indisputable. </s>
<s>  he saw these things with howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm. </s>
<s>  and then suddenly howard was gone and he stood alone. </s>
<s>  he perceived that the cries of "the sleeper" grew in volume, and that the people on the nearer platform were standing up. </s>
<s>  the nearer swifter platform he perceived was empty to the right of him, and far across the space the platform running in the opposite direction was coming crowded and passing away bare. </s>
<s>  with incredible swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space before his eyes. </s>
<s>  a dense swaying mass of people, and the shouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous incessant clamour: "the sleeper!" the sleeper!" and yells and cheers, a waving of garments and cries of "stop the ways!" they were also crying another name strange to graham. </s>
<s>  it sounded like "ostrog. </s>
<s> " the slower platforms were soon thick with active people, running against the movement so as to keep themselves opposite to him. </s>
<s>  "stop the ways," they cried. </s>
<s>  agile figures ran up swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearest to him, were borne rapidly past him, shouting strange, unintelligible things, and ran back obliquely to the central way. </s>
<s>  one thing he distinguished: "it is indeed the sleeper. </s>
<s>  it is indeed the sleeper," they testified. </s>
<s>  for a space graham stood without a movement. </s>
<s>  then he became vividly aware that all this concerned him. </s>
<s>  he was pleased at his wonderful popularity, he bowed,  seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his arm. </s>
<s>  he was astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked. </s>
<s>  the tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious violence. </s>
<s>  he became aware of crowded balconies, of men sliding along ropes, of men in trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space. </s>
<s>  he heard voices behind him, a number of people descending the steps through the archway. </s>
<s>  he suddenly perceived that his guardian howard was back again and gripping his arm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear. </s>
<s>  he turned, and howard's face was white. </s>
<s>  "come back," he heard. </s>
<s>  "they will stop the ways. </s>
<s>  the whole city will be in confusion. </s>
<s> " he perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars behind howard, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall man in vivid vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and all these people had anxious eager faces. </s>
<s>  "get him away," cried howard. </s>
<s>  "but why?" said graham. </s>
<s>  "i don't see--" "you must come away!" said the man in red in a resolute voice. </s>
<s>  his face and eyes were resolute, too. </s>
<s>  graham's glances went from face to face, and he was suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavour in life, compulsion. </s>
<s>  some one gripped his arm. </s>
<s>  he was being dragged away. </s>
<s>  it seemed as though the tumult suddenly became two, as if half the shouts that had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung into the passages of the great building behind him. </s>
<s>  marvelling and confused, feeling an impotent desire to resist, graham was half led, half thrust, along the passage of blue pillars, and suddenly he found himself alone with howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward. </s>
<s>  chapter vi the hall of the atlas from the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when graham found himself in the lift, was altogether barely five minutes. </s>
<s>  and as yet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him, as yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched everything with wonder, with a sense of the irrational, with something of the quality of a realistic dream. </s>
<s>  he was still detached, an astonished spectator, still but half involved in life. </s>
<s>  what he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed in the setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre. </s>
<s>  "i don't underst" he said. </s>
<s>  "what was the trouble? my mind is in a whirl. </s>
<s>  why were they shouting? what is the danger?" "we have our troubles," said howard. </s>
<s>  his eyes avoided graham's enquiry. </s>
<s>  "this is a time of unrest. </s>
<s>   in fact, your appearance, your waking just now, has a sort of connexion--" he spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. </s>
<s>  he stopped abruptly. </s>
<s>  "i don't underst" said graham. </s>
<s>  "it will be clearer later," said howard. </s>
<s>  he glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the lift slow. </s>
<s>  "i shall understand better, no doubt, when i have seen my way about a little," said graham puzzled. </s>
<s>  "it. </s>
<s>  will be--it is bound to be perplexing. </s>
<s>  at present it is all so strange. </s>
<s>  anything seems possible. </s>
<s>  anything in the details even. </s>
<s>  your counting, i underst is different. </s>
<s> " the lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long passage between high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables. </s>
<s>  "what a huge place this is!" said graham. </s>
<s>  "is it all one building? what place is it?" "this is one of the city ways for various public services. </s>
<s>  light and so forth. </s>
<s> " "was it a social trouble--that--in the great roadway place? how are you governed? have you still a police?" "several," said howard. </s>
<s>  "several? " "about fourteen. </s>
<s> " "i don't understand. </s>
<s> " "very probably not. </s>
<s>  our social order will probably seem very complex to you. </s>
<s>  to tell you the truth, i don't understand it myself very clearly. </s>
<s>  nobody does. </s>
<s>  you will, perhaps--bye and bye. </s>
<s>  we have to go to the council. </s>
<s> "  graham's attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his inquiries and the people in the passages and halls they were traversing. </s>
<s>  for a moment his mind would be concentrated upon howard and the halting answers he made, and then he would lose the thread in response to some vivid unexpected impression. </s>
<s>  along the passages, in the halls, half the people seemed to be men in the red uniform. </s>
<s>  the pale blue canvas that had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear. </s>
<s>  invariably these men looked at him, and saluted him and howard as they passed. </s>
<s>  he had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were a number of girls sitting on low seats and as though in a class. </s>
<s>  he saw no teacher, but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice proceeded. </s>
<s>  the girls regarded him and his conductor, he thought, with curiosity and astonishment. </s>
<s>  but he was hurried on before he could form a clear idea of the gathering. </s>
<s>  he judged they knew howard and not himself, and that they wondered who he was. </s>
<s>  this howard, it seemed, was a person of importance. </s>
<s>  but then he was also merely graham's guardian. </s>
<s>  that was odd. </s>
<s>  there came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung so that he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon, but no more of them. </s>
<s>  then vague impressions of galleries and of casual astonished passers-by turning round to stare after the two of them with their red-clad guard. </s>
<s>  the stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary. </s>
<s>  he was speedily fatigued by this excessive haste. </s>
<s>  he asked howard to slacken his speed. </s>
<s>  presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great street space, but this was glazed and did not open, and they were too high for him to see the moving platforms below. </s>
<s>  but he saw people going to and fro along cables and along strange, frail-looking ridges. </s>
<s>  and thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it. </s>
<s>  they crossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass, so clear that it made him giddy even to remember it. </s>
<s>  the floor of it also was of glass. </s>
<s>  from his memory of the cliffs between new quay and boscastle, so remote in time, and so recent in his experience, it seemed to him that they must be near four hundred feet above the moving ways. </s>
<s>  he stopped, looked down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red multitudes, minute and fore- shortened, struggling and gesticulating still towards the little balcony far below, a little toy balcony, it seemed, where he had so recently been standing. </s>
<s>  a thin haze and the glare of the mighty globes of light obscured everything. </s>
<s>  a man seated in a little open- work cradle shot by from some point still higher than the little narrow bridge, rushing down a cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling. </s>
<s>  graham stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish in a great circular opening below, and then his eyes went back to the tumultuous struggle. </s>
<s>  along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots. </s>
<s>  this broke up into individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring down the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central area. </s>
<s>  these men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons. </s>
<s>  they seemed to be striking and thrusting. </s>
<s>  a great shouting, cries of wrath, screaming, burst out and came up to graham, faint and thin. </s>
<s>  "go on," cried howard, laying hands on him. </s>
<s>  another man rushed down a cable. </s>
<s>  graham suddenly glanced up to see whence he came, and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of cables and girders, dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of windmills, and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky. </s>
<s>  then howard had thrust him forward across the bridge, and he was in a little narrow passage decorated with geometrical patterns. </s>
<s>  "i want to see more of that," cried graham, resisting. </s>
<s>  "no, no," cried howard, still gripping his arm. </s>
<s>  "this way. </s>
<s>  you must go this way. </s>
<s> " and the men in red following them seemed ready to enforce his orders. </s>
<s>  some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared down the passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that had seemed a door to graham, and led the way through it. </s>
<s>  graham found himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber. </s>
<s>  the attendant in black and yellow crossed this, thrust up a second shutter and stood waiting. </s>
<s>  this place had the appearance of an ante-room. </s>
<s>  he saw a number of people in the central space, and at the opposite end a large and imposing doorway at the top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained but giving a glimpse of some still larger hall beyond. </s>
<s>  he perceived white men in red and other negroes in black and yellow standing stiffly about those portals. </s>
<s>  as they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, "the sleeper," and was aware of a turning of heads, a hum of observation. </s>
<s>  they entered another little passage in the wall of this ante-chamber, and then he found himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that passed round the side of the great hall he had already seen through the curtains. </s>
<s>  he entered the place at the corner, so that he received the fullest impression of its huge proportions. </s>
<s>  the black in the wasp uniform stood aside like a well-trained servant, and closed the valve behind him. </s>
<s>  compared with any of the places graham had see thus far, this second hall appeared to be decorate with extreme richness. </s>
<s>  on a pedestal at the remote end, and more brilliantly lit than any other object, was a gigantic white figure of atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe upon his bowed shoulders. </s>
<s>  it was the first thing to strike his attention, it was so vast, so patiently and painfully real, so white and simple. </s>
<s>  save for this figure and for a dais in the centre, the wide floor of the place was a shining vacancy. </s>
<s>  the dais was remote in the greatness of the area. </s>
<s>  it would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group of seven men who stood about a table on it, and gave an inkling of its proportions. </s>
<s>  they were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to have arisen that moment from their seats, and they were regarding graham steadfastly. </s>
<s>  at the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances. </s>
<s>  howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this mighty labouring figure. </s>
<s>  then he stopped. </s>
<s>  the two men in red who had followed them into the gallery came and stood on either hand of graham. </s>
<s>  "you must remain here," murmured howard, "for a few moments,"  without waiting for a reply, hurried away along the gallery. </s>
<s>  " __why?"__ began graham. </s>
<s>  he moved as if to follow howard, and found his path obstructed by one of the men in red. </s>
<s>  "you have to wait here, sire," said the man in red. </s>
<s>  __"why?"__ "orders, sire. </s>
<s> " "whose orders? " "our orders, sire. </s>
<s> " graham looked his exasperation. </s>
<s>  "what place is this?" he said presently. </s>
<s>  "who are those men? " "they are the lords of the council, sire. </s>
<s> " "what council? " "__the__ council. </s>
<s> " "oh!" said graham, and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other man, went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white, who stood watching him and whispering together. </s>
<s>  the council? he perceived there were now eight, though how the newcomer had arrived he had not observed. </s>
<s>  they made no gestures of greeting. </s>
<s>  they stood regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might have stood in the street regarding a distant balloon that had suddenly floated into view. </s>
<s>  what council could it be that gathered there, that little body of men beneath the significant white atlas, secluded from every eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness? and why should he be brought to them, and be looked at strangely and spoken of inaudibly? howard appeared beneath, walking quickly across the polished floor towards them. </s>
<s>  as he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar movements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. </s>
<s>  then he ascended the steps of the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the end of the table. </s>
<s>  graham watched that visible inaudible conversation. </s>
<s>  occasionally, one of the white-robed men would glance towards him. </s>
<s>  he strained his ears in vain. </s>
<s>  the gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated. </s>
<s>  he glanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants. </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  when he looked again howard was extending his hands and moving his head like a man who protests. </s>
<s>  he was interrupted, it seemed, by one of the white-robed men rapping the table. </s>
<s>  the conversation lasted an interminable time to graham's sense. </s>
<s>  his eyes rose to the still giant at whose feet the council sat. </s>
<s>  thence they wandered at last to the walls of the hall. </s>
<s>  it was decorated in long painted panels of a quasi-japanese type, many of them very beautiful. </s>
<s>  these panels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark metal, which passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries, and the great structural lines of the interior. </s>
<s>  the facile grace of these panels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the centre of the scheme. </s>
<s>  graham's eyes came back to the council, and howard was descending the steps. </s>
<s>  as he drew nearer his features could be distinguished, and graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his cheeks. </s>
<s>  his countenance was still disturbed when presently he reappeared along the gallery. </s>
<s>  "this way," he said concisely, and they went on in silence to a little door that opened at their approach. </s>
<s>  the two men in red stopped on either side of this door. </s>
<s>  howard and graham passed in, and graham, glancing back, saw the white-robed council still standing in a close group and looking at him. </s>
<s>  then the door closed behind him with a heavy thud, and for the first time since his awakening he was in silence. </s>
<s>  the floor, even, was noiseless to his feet. </s>
<s>  howard opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguous chambers furnished in white and green. </s>
<s>  "what council was that? " began graham. </s>
<s>  "what were they discussing? what have they to do with me?" howard closed the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something in an undertone. </s>
<s>  he walked slanting ways across the room and turned, blowing out his cheeks again. </s>
<s>  "ugh!" he grunted, a man relieved. </s>
<s>  graham stood regarding him. </s>
<s>  "you must underst" began howard abruptly, avoiding graham's eyes, "that our social order is very complex. </s>
<s>  a half explanation, a bare unqualified statement would give you false impressions. </s>
<s>  as a matter of fact--it is a case of compound interest partly--your small fortune, and the fortune of your cousin warming which was left to you--and certain other beginnings--have become very considerable. </s>
<s>  and in other ways that will be hard for you to underst you have become a person of significance--of very considerable significance--involved in the world's affairs. </s>
<s> " he stopped. </s>
<s>  "yes?" said graham. </s>
<s>  "we have grave social troubles. </s>
<s> " "yes? " "things have come to such a pass that, in fact, is advisable to seclude you here. </s>
<s> " "keep me prisoner! " exclaimed graham. </s>
<s>  "well--to ask you to keep in seclusion. </s>
<s> " graham turned on him. </s>
<s>  "this is strange!" he said. </s>
<s>  "no harm will be done you. </s>
<s> " "no harm ! " "but you must be kept here--"  "while i learn my position, i presume. </s>
<s> " "precisely. </s>
<s> " "very well then. </s>
<s>  begin. </s>
<s>  why __harm?__" " not now. </s>
<s> " "why not? " "it is too long a story, sire. </s>
<s> " "all the more reason i should begin at once. </s>
<s>  you say i am a person of importance. </s>
<s>  what was that shouting i heard? why is a great multitude shouting and excited because my trance is over, and who are the men in white in that huge council chamber? " "all in good time, sire," said howard. </s>
<s>  "but not crudely, not crudely. </s>
<s>  this is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. </s>
<s>  your awakening. </s>
<s>  no one expected your awakening. </s>
<s>  the council is consulting. </s>
<s> " "what council? " "the council you saw. </s>
<s> " graham made a petulant movement. </s>
<s>  " this is not right," he said. </s>
<s>  " i should be told what is happening. </s>
<s>  "you must wait. </s>
<s>  really you must wait. </s>
<s> " graham sat down abruptly. </s>
<s>  "i suppose since i have waited so long to resume life," he said, "that i must wait a little longer. </s>
<s> " "that is better," said howard. </s>
<s>  "yes, that is much better. </s>
<s>  and i must leave you alone. </s>
<s>  for a space. </s>
<s>  while i attend the discussion in the council. </s>
<s>  i am sorry. </s>
<s> " he went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished. </s>
<s>  graham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in some way he never came to underst turned about, paced the room restlessly, made the circuit of the room, and sat down. </s>
<s>  he remained sitting for some time with folded arms and knitted brow, biting his finger nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions of this first hour of awakened life. </s>
<s>  the vast mechanical spaces, the endless series of chambers and passages, the great struggle that roared and splashed through these strange ways, the little group of remote unsympathetic men beneath the colossal atlas, howard's mysterious behaviour. </s>
<s>  there was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in his mind--a vast inheritance perhaps misapplied--of some unprecedented importance and opportunity. </s>
<s>  what had he to do? and this room's secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonment! it came into graham's mind with irresistible conviction that this series of magnificent impressions was a dream. </s>
<s>  he tried to shut his eyes and succeeded, but that time-honoured device led to no awakening. </s>
<s>  presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments of the two small rooms in which he found himself. </s>
<s>  in a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished. </s>
<s>  he was clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with a little greyshot beard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked now with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but graceful manner. </s>
<s>  he seemed a man of five-and-forty perhaps. </s>
<s>  for a moment he did not perceive this was himself. </s>
<s>  a flash of laughter came with the recognition. </s>
<s>  "to call on old warming like this!" he exclaimed, "and make him take me out to lunch! " then he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few familiar acquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his amusement realised that every soul with whom he might jest had died many score of years ago. </s>
<s>  the thought smote him abruptly and keenly. </s>
<s>  he stopped short, the expression of his face changed to a white consternation. </s>
<s>  the tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge facade of that wonderful street reasserted itself. </s>
<s>  the shouting multitudes came back clear and vivid, and those remote, inaudible, unfriendly councilors in white. </s>
<s>  he felt himself a little figure, very small and ineffectual, pitifully conspicuous. </s>
<s>  and all about him, the world was--strange. </s>
<s>  chapter vii in the silent rooms presently graham resumed his examination of his apartments. </s>
<s>  curiosity kept him moving in spite of his fatigue. </s>
<s>  the inner room, he perceived, was high, and its ceiling dome shaped', with an oblong aperture in the centre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad vans seemed to be rotating, apparently driving the air up the shaft. </s>
<s>  the faint humming note of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet place. </s>
<s>  as these vans sprang up one after the other, graham could get transient glimpses of the sky. </s>
<s>  he was surprised to see a star. </s>
<s>  this drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these rooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the cornices. </s>
<s>  there were no windows. </s>
<s>  and he began to recall that along all the vast chambers and passages he had traversed with howard he had observed no windows at all. </s>
<s>  had there been windows? there were windows on the street indeed, but were they for light? or was the whole city lit day and night for evermore, so that there was no night there? and another thing dawned upon him. </s>
<s>  there was no fireplace in either room. </s>
<s>  was the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or was the whole city uniformly heated or cooled? he became interested in these questions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls, the simply constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedroom service was practically abolished. </s>
<s>  and over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form and colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. </s>
<s>  there were several very comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance like jelly. </s>
<s>  then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no writing materials. </s>
<s>  "the world has changed indeed," he said. </s>
<s>  he observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of peculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that harmonized with the decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre of this side projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a white smooth face to the room. </s>
<s>  a chair faced this. </s>
<s>  he had a transitory idea that these cylinders might be books, or a modern substitute for books, but at first it did not seem so. </s>
<s>  the lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. </s>
<s>  at first sight it seemed like russian. </s>
<s>  then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated english about certain of the words. </s>
<s>           "oi man huwdbi kin" forced itself on him as "the man who would be king. </s>
<s> " "phonetic spelling," he said. </s>
<s>  he remembered reading a story with that title, then he recalled the story vividly, one of the best stories in the world. </s>
<s>  but this thing before him was not a book as he understood it. </s>
<s>  he puzzled out the titles of two adjacent cylinders. </s>
<s>  'the heart of darkness,' he had never heard of before nor 'the madonna of the future'--no doubt if they were indeed stories, they were by post victorian authors. </s>
<s>  he puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it. </s>
<s>  then he turned to the square apparatus and examined that. </s>
<s>  he opened a sort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within, and on the upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell. </s>
<s>  he pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased. </s>
<s>  he became aware of voices and music, and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front face. </s>
<s>  he suddenly realised what this might be, and stepped back to regard it. </s>
<s>  on the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured, and in this picture were figures that moved. </s>
<s>  not only did they move, but they were conversing in clear small voices. </s>
<s>  it was exactly like reality viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through a long tube. </s>
<s>  his interest was seized at once by the situation, which presented a man pacing up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant woman. </s>
<s>  both were in the picturesque costume that seemed so strange to graham. </s>
<s>  "i have worked," said the man, "but what have you been doing?" "ah!" said graham. </s>
<s>  he forgot everything else, and sat down in the chair. </s>
<s>  within five minutes he heard himself named, heard "when the sleeper wakes," used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed himself by, a thing remote and incredible. </s>
<s>  but in a little while he knew those two people like l . </s>
<s>  intimate friends. </s>
<s>  at last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of the apparatus was blank again. </s>
<s>  it was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see, unscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire economic struggle. </s>
<s>  there were allusions he did not underst incidents that conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of dubious enlightenment. </s>
<s>  the blue canvas that bulked so largely in his first impression of the city ways appeared again and again as the costume of the common people. </s>
<s>  he had no doubt the story was contemporary, and its intense realism was undeniable. </s>
<s>  and the end had been a tragedy that oppressed him. </s>
<s>  he sat staring at the blankness. </s>
<s>  he started and rubbed his eyes. </s>
<s>  he had been so absorbed in the latter-day substitute for a novel, that he awoke to the little green and white room with more than a touch of the surprise of his first awakening. </s>
<s>  he stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland. </s>
<s>  the clearness of the kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the vast place of streets, the ambiguous council, the swift phases of his waking hour, came back. </s>
<s>  these people had spoken of the council with suggestions of a vague universality of power. </s>
<s>  and they had spoken of the sleeper. </s>
<s>  it had not really struck him vividly at the time that he was the sleeper. </s>
<s>  he had to recall precisely what they had said. </s>
<s>  he walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of the revolving fan. </s>
<s>  as the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery came in rhythmic eddies. </s>
<s>  all else was silence. </s>
<s>  though the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he perceived the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep blue--black almost, with a dust of little stars. </s>
<s>  he resumed his examination of the rooms. </s>
<s>  he could find no way of opening the padded door, no bell nor other means of calling for attendance. </s>
<s>  his feeling of wonder was in abeyance. </s>
<s>  but he was curious, anxious for information. </s>
<s>  he wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new things. </s>
<s>  he tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to him. </s>
<s>  presently he became restless and eager for information, for distraction, for fresh sensations. </s>
<s>  he went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled out the method of replacing the cylinders by others. </s>
<s>  as he did so, it came into his mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed the language so that it was still clear and understand- able after two hundred years. </s>
<s>  the haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical fantasia. </s>
<s>  at first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous. </s>
<s>  he presently recognized what appeared to him to be an altered version of the story of tannhauser. </s>
<s>  the music was unfamiliar. </s>
<s>  but the rendering was realistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. </s>
<s>  tannhauser did not go to a venusberg, but to a pleasure city. </s>
<s>  what was a pleasure city? a dream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer. </s>
<s>  he became interested, curious. </s>
<s>  the story developed with a flavour of strangely twisted sentimentality. </s>
<s>  suddenly he did not like it. </s>
<s>  he liked it less as it proceeded. </s>
<s>  he had a revulsion of feeling. </s>
<s>  these were no pictures, no idealisations, but photographed realities. </s>
<s>  he wanted no more of the twenty-second century venusberg. </s>
<s>  he forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth century art, and gave way to an archaic indignation. </s>
<s>  he rose, angry and half ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even in solitude. </s>
<s>  he pulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought for a means of stopping its action. </s>
<s>  something snapped. </s>
<s>  a violet spark stung and convulsed his arm and the thing was still. </s>
<s>  when he attempted next day to replace these tannhauser cylinders by another pair, he found the apparatus broken. </s>
<s>  he struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro, struggling with intolerable vast impressions. </s>
<s>  the things he had derived from the cylinders and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him. </s>
<s>  it seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty years of life he had never tried to shape a picture of these coming times. </s>

<s>  but conflicts in the city ways! and the systematised sensuality of a class of rich men! he thought of bellamy, the hero of whose socialistic utopia had so oddly anticipated this actual experience. </s>
<s>  but here was no utopia, no socialistic state. </s>
<s>  he had already seen enough to realise that the ancient antithesis of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand and abject poverty on the other, still prevailed. </s>
<s>  he knew enough of the essential factors of life to understand that correlation. </s>

<s>  he listened for long spaces under the ventilator to catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding in the city. </s>
<s>  he began to talk to himself. </s>
<s>  "two hundred and three years! " he said to himself over and over again, laughing stupidly. </s>

<s>  he remembered fragments, for the most part trivial moments, things of no great importance that he had observed. </s>
<s>  his boyhood seemed the most accessible at first, he recalled school books and certain lessons in mensuration. </s>
<s>  then he revived the more salient features of his life, memories of the wife long since dead, her magic influence now gone beyond corruption, of his rivals and friends and betrayers, of the swift decision of this issue and that, and then of his , last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves, and at last of his strenuous studies. </s>
<s>  in a little while he perceived he had it all again. </s>

<s>  and the hue of it was a deepening misery. </s>
<s>  was it worth re-polishing? by a miracle he had been lifted out of a life that had become intolerable. </s>
<s>  he reverted to his present condition. </s>
<s>  he wrestled with the facts in vain. </s>
<s>  it became an inextricable tangle. </s>
<s>  he saw the sky through the ventilator pink with dawn. </s>
<s>  an old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his memory. </s>
<s>  "i must sleep," he said. </s>
<s>  it appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distress and from the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs. </s>
<s>  he went to the strange little bed, lay down and was presently asleep. </s>
<s>  he was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments before he left them, for he remained imprisoned for three days. </s>
<s>  during that time no one, except howard, entered his prison. </s>
<s>  the marvel of his fate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel of his survival. </s>
<s>  he had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this unaccountable solitude. </s>
<s>  howard came regularly with subtly sustaining and nutritive fluids, and light and pleasant foods, quite strange to graham. </s>
<s>  he always closed the door carefully as he entered. </s>
<s>  on matters of detail he was increasingly obliging, but the bearing of graham on the great issues that were evidently being contested so closely beyond the soundproof walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate. </s>
<s>  he evaded, as politely as possible, every question on the position of affairs in the outer world. </s>
<s>  and in those three days graham's incessant thoughts went far and wide. </s>
<s>  all that he had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing, worked together in his mind. </s>
<s>  almost every possible interpretation of his position he debated--even as it chanced, the right interpretation. </s>
<s>  things that presently happened to him, came to him at last credible, by virtue of this seclusion. </s>
<s>  when at length the moment of his release arrived, it found him prepared. </s>
<s>  howard's bearing went far to deepen graham's impression of his own strange importance. </s>
<s>  the door between its opening and closing seemed to admit with him a breath of momentous happening. </s>
<s>  his enquiries became more definite and searching. </s>
<s>  howard retreated through protests and difficulties. </s>
<s>  the awakening was unforeseen, he repeated. </s>
<s>  it happened to have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion. </s>
<s>  "to explain it i must tell you the history of a gross and a half of years," protested howard. </s>
<s>  "the thing is this," said graham. </s>
<s>  "you are afraid of something i shall do. </s>
<s>  in some way i am arbitrator--i might be arbitrator. </s>
<s> " " it is not that. </s>
<s>  but you have--i may tell you this much--the automatic increase of your property puts great possibilities of interference in your hands. </s>
<s>  and in certain other ways you have influence, with your eighteenth century notions. </s>
<s> " "nineteenth century," corrected graham. </s>
<s>  "with your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as you are of every feature of our state. </s>
<s> " "am i a fool? " "certainly not. </s>
<s> " "do i seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?" "you were never expected to act at all. </s>
<s>  no one counted on your awakening. </s>
<s>  no one dreamt you would ever awake. </s>
<s>  the council had surrounded you with antiseptic conditions. </s>
<s>  as a matter of fact, we thought that you were dead--a mere arrest of decay. </s>
<s>  and--but it is too complex. </s>
<s>  we dare not suddenly --while you are still half awake. </s>
<s> " "it won't do," said graham. </s>
<s>  "suppose it is as you say--why am i not being crammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit me for my responsibilities? am i any wiser now than two days ago, if it is two days, when i awoke?" howard pulled his lip. </s>
<s>  "i am beginning to feel--every hour i feel more clearly--a sense of complex concealment of which you are the salient point. </s>
<s>  is this council, or committee, or whatever they are, cooking the accounts of my estate? is that it? " "that note of suspicion--" said howard. </s>
<s>  " ugh!" said graham. </s>
<s>  "now, mark my words, it will be ill for those who have put me here. </s>
<s>  it will be ill. </s>
<s>  i am alive. </s>
<s>  make no doubt of it, i am alive. </s>
<s>  every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more vigorous. </s>
<s>  no more quiescence. </s>
<s>  i am a "__live!__" howard's face lit with an idea. </s>
<s>  he came towards graham and spoke in an easy confidential tone. </s>
<s>  "the council secludes you here for your good. </s>
<s>  you are restless. </s>
<s>  naturally--an energetic man! you find it dull here. </s>
<s>  but we are anxious that everything you may desire--every desire--every sort of desire . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  there may be something. </s>
<s>  is there any sort of company? " he paused meaningly. </s>
<s>  " yes," said graham thoughtfully. </s>
<s>  " there is. </s>
<s> " "ah! __now!__ we have treated you neglectfully. </s>
<s> " "the crowds in yonder streets of yours. </s>
<s> " "that," said howard, "i am afraid--. </s>
<s>  but--" graham began pacing the room. </s>
<s>  howard stood near the door watching him. </s>
<s>  the implication of howard's suggestion was only half evident to graham company? suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand some sort of __company__? would there be any possibilities of gathering from the conversation o£ this additional person some vague inkling of the struggle that had broken out so vividly at his waking moment? he meditated again, and the suggestion took colour. </s>
<s>  he turned on howard abruptly. </s>
<s>  "what do you mean by company? " howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. </s>
<s>  "human beings," he said, with a curious smile on his heavy face. </s>
<s>  "our social ideas," he said, "have a certain increased liberality, perhaps, in comparison with your times. </s>
<s>  if a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as this--by feminine society, for instance. </s>
<s>  we think it no scandal. </s>
<s>  we have cleared our minds of formulae. </s>
<s>  there is in our city a class, a necessary class, no longer despised--discreet--" graham stopped dead. </s>
<s>  "it would pass the time," said howard. </s>
<s>  "it is a thing i should perhaps have thought of before,  as a matter of fact, so much is happening--" he indicated the exterior world. </s>
<s>  graham hesitated. </s>
<s>  for a moment the figure of a possible woman that his imagination suddenly created dominated his mind with an intense attraction. </s>
<s>  then he flashed into anger. </s>
<s>  "no i" he shouted. </s>
<s>  he began striding rapidly up and down the room. </s>
<s>  "everything you say, everything you do, convinces me--of some great issue in which i am concerned. </s>
<s>  i do not want to pass the time, as you call it. </s>
<s>  yes, i know. </s>
<s>  desire and indulgence are life in a sense-- and death! extinction! in my life before i slept i had worked out that pitiful question. </s>
<s>  i will not begin again. </s>
<s>  there is a city, a multitude--. </s>
<s>  and meanwhile i am here like a rabbit in a bag. </s>
<s> " his rage surged high. </s>
<s>  he choked for a moment and began to wave his clenched fists. </s>
<s>  he gave way to an anger fit, he swore archaic curses. </s>
<s>  his gestures had the quality of physical threats. </s>
<s>  "i do not know who your party may be. </s>
<s>  i am in the dark, and you keep me in the dark. </s>
<s>  but i know this, that i am secluded here for no good purpose. </s>
<s>  for no good purpose. </s>
<s>  i warn you, i warn you of the consequences. </s>
<s>  once i come at my power--" he realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself. </s>
<s>  he stopped. </s>
<s>  howard stood regarding him with a curious expression. </s>
<s>  "i take it this is a message to the council," said howard. </s>
<s>  graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man, fell or stun him. </s>
<s>  it must have shown upon his face. </s>
<s>  at any rate howard's movement was quick. </s>
<s>  in a second the noiseless door had closed again, and the man from the nineteenth century was alone. </s>
<s>  for a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands half raised. </s>
<s>  then he flung them down. </s>
<s>  "what a fool i have been!" he said, and gave way to his anger again, stamping about the room and shouting curses. </s>
<s>  for a long time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy, raging at his position, at his own folly, at the knaves who had imprisoned him. </s>
<s>  he did this because he did not want to look calmly at his position. </s>
<s>  he clung to his anger--because he was afraid of fear. </s>
<s>  presently he found himself reasoning with himself this imprisonment was unaccountable, but no doubt the legal forms--new legal forms--of the time permitted it. </s>
<s>  it must, of course, be legal. </s>
<s>  these people were two hundred years further on in the march of civilisation than the victorian generation. </s>
<s>  it was not likely they would be less--humane. </s>
<s>  yet they had cleared their minds of formulae! was humanity a formula as well as chastity? his imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him. </s>
<s>  the attempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestions, though for the most part logically valid, were quite unavailing. </s>
<s>  "why should anything be done to me? " "if the worst comes to the worst," he found himself saying at last, "i can give up what they want. </s>
<s>  but what do they want? and why don't they ask me for it instead of cooping me up? " he returned to his former preoccupation with the council's possible intentions. </s>
<s>  he began to reconsider the details of howard's behaviour, sinister glances, inexplicable hesitations. </s>
<s>  then, for a time, his mind circled about the idea of escaping from these rooms. </s>
<s>  but whither could he escape into this vast, crowded world? he would be worse off than a saxon yeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century london. </s>
<s>  and besides, how could anyone escape from these rooms? "how can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me? " he thought of the tumult, the great social trouble of which he was so unaccountably the axis. </s>
<s>  a text, irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistent, came floating up out of the darkness of his memory. </s>
<s>  this also a council had said: "it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people. </s>
<s> " chapter viii the roof spaces as the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and permitted glimpses of the night, dim sounds drifted in thereby. </s>
<s>  and graham, standing underneath, wrestling darkly with the unknown powers that imprisoned him, and which he had now deliberately challenged, was startled by the sound of a voice. </s>
<s>  he peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation, dark and dim, the face and shoulders of a man regarding him. </s>
<s>  when a dark hand was extended, the swift van struck it, swung round and beat on with a little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade, and something began to fall therefrom upon the floor, dripping silently. </s>
<s>   graham looked down, and there were spots of blood at his feet. </s>
<s>  he looked up again in a strange excitement. </s>
<s>  the figure had gone. </s>
<s>  he remained motionless--his every sense intent upon the flickering patch of darkness, for outside it was high night. </s>
<s>  he became aware of some faint, remote, dark specks floating lightly through the outer air. </s>
<s>  they came down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan. </s>
<s>  a gleam of light flickered, the specks flashed white, and then the darkness came again. </s>
<s>  warmed and lit as he was, he perceived that it was snowing within a few feet of him. </s>
<s>  graham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again. </s>
<s>  he saw the head of a man pass near. </s>
<s>  there was a sound of whispering. </s>
<s>  then a smart blow on some metallic substance, effort, voices, and the vans stopped. </s>
<s>  a gust of snowflakes whirled into the room, and vanished before they touched the floor. </s>
<s>  "don't be afraid," said a voice. </s>
<s>  graham stood under the van. </s>
<s>  "who are you?" he whispered. </s>
<s>  for a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan, and then the head of a man was thrust cautiously into the opening. </s>
<s>  his face appeared nearly inverted to graham. </s>
<s>  his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes of snow upon it. </s>
<s>  his arm went up into the darkness holding something unseen. </s>
<s>  he had a youthful face and bright eyes, and the veins of his forehead were swollen. </s>
<s>  he seemed to be exerting himself to maintain his position. </s>
<s>  for several seconds neither he nor graham spoke. </s>
<s>  "you were the sleeper?" said the stranger at last. </s>
<s>  "yes," said graham. </s>
<s>  "what do you want with me?" "i come from ostrog, sire. </s>
<s> " "ostrog?" the man in the ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was towards graham. </s>
<s>  he appeared to be listening. </s>
<s>  suddenly there was a hasty exclamation, and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape the sweep of the released fan. </s>
<s>  and when graham peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly falling snow. </s>
<s>  it was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the ventilator. </s>
<s>  but at last came the same metallic interference again. </s>
<s>  the fans stopped and the face reappeared. </s>
<s>  graham had remained all this time in the same place, alert and tremulously excited. </s>
<s>  "who are you? what do you want?" he said. </s>
<s>  "we want to speak to you, sire," said the intruder. </s>
<s>  "we want--i can't hold the thing. </s>
<s>  we have been trying to find a way to you these three days. </s>
<s> " "is it rescue? " whispered graham. </s>
<s>  " escape?" "yes, sire. </s>
<s>  if you will. </s>
<s> " "you are my party--the party of the sleeper?" "yes, sire. </s>
<s> " "what am i to do?" said graham. </s>
<s>  there was a struggle. </s>
<s>  the stranger's arm appeared, and his hand was bleeding. </s>
<s>  his knees came into view over the edge of the funnel. </s>
<s>  "stand away from me," he said, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and one shoulder at graham's feet. </s>
<s>  the released ventilator whirled noisily. </s>
<s>  the stranger rolled over, sprang up nimbly and stood panting, hand to a bruised shoulder, and with his bright eyes on graham. </s>
<s>  "you are indeed the sleeper," he said. </s>
<s>  "i saw you asleep. </s>
<s>  when it was the law that anyone might see you. </s>
<s> " "i am the man who was in the trance," said graham. </s>
<s>  "they have imprisoned me here. </s>
<s>  i have been here since i awoke--at least three days. </s>
<s> " the intruder seemed about to speak, heard something, glanced swiftly at the door, and suddenly left graham and ran towards it, shouting quick incoherent words. </s>
<s>  a bright wedge of steel flashed in his h and he began tap, tap, a quick succession of blows upon the hinges. </s>
<s>  "mind!" cried a voice. </s>
<s>  "oh!" the voice came from above. </s>
<s>  graham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet, ducked, was struck on the shoulder by one of them, and a heavy weight bore him to the earth. </s>
<s>  he fell on his knees and forward, and the weight went over his head. </s>
<s>  he knelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him. </s>
<s>  "i did not see you, sire," panted the man. </s>
<s>  he rose and assisted graham to arise. </s>
<s>  "are you hurt, sire?" he panted. </s>
<s>  a succession of heavy blows on the ventilator began, something fell close to graham's face, and a shivering edge of white metal danced, fell over, and lay flat upon the floor. </s>
<s>  "what is this?" cried graham, confused and looking at the ventilator. </s>
<s>  "who are you? what are you going to do? remember, i understand nothing. </s>
<s> " "stand back," said the stranger, and drew him from under the ventilator as another fragment of metal fell heavily. </s>
<s>  " we want you to come, sire," panted the newcomer, and graham glancing at his face again, saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his fore- head, and a couple of little trickles of blood starting therefrom. </s>
<s>  "your people call for you. </s>
<s> " "come where? my people? " "to the hall about the markets. </s>
<s>  your life is in danger here. </s>
<s>  we have spies. </s>
<s>  we learned but just in time. </s>
<s>  the council has decided--this very day-- either to drug or kill you. </s>
<s>  and everything is ready. </s>
<s>  the people are drilled, the wind-vane police, the engineers, and half the way-gearers are with us. </s>
<s>  we have the halls crowded--shouting. </s>
<s>  the whole city shouts against the council. </s>
<s>  we have arms. </s>
<s> " he wiped the blood with his hand. </s>
<s>  "your life here is not worth--" "but why arms? " "the people have risen to protect you, sire. </s>
<s>  what? " he turned quickly as the man who had first come down made a hissing with his teeth. </s>
<s>  graham saw the latter start back, gesticulate to them to conceal themselves, and move as if to hide behind the opening door. </s>
<s>  as he did so howard appeared, a little tray in one hand and his heavy face downcast. </s>
<s>  he started, looked up, the door slammed behind him, the tray tilted side- ways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear. </s>
<s>  he went down like a felled tree, and lay as he fell athwart the floor of the outer room. </s>
<s>  the man who had struck him bent hastily, studied his face for a moment, rose, and returned to his work at the door. </s>
<s>  "your poison!" said a voice in graham's ear. </s>
<s>  then abruptly they were in darkness. </s>
<s>  the innumerable cornice lights had been extinguished. </s>
<s>  graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly snow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. </s>
<s>  three knelt on the van. </s>
<s>  some dim thing--a ladder was being lowered through the opening, and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light. </s>
<s>  he had a moment of hesitation. </s>
<s>  but the manner of these men, their swift alacrity, their words, marched so completely with his own fears of the council, with his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a moment. </s>
<s>  and his people awaited him! "i do not underst" he said, "i trust. </s>
<s>  tell me what to do. </s>
<s> " the man with the cut brow gripped graham's arm. </s>
<s>  "clamber up the ladder," he whispered. </s>
<s>  "quick. </s>
<s>  they will have heard--" graham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put his foot on the lower rung,  turning his head, saw over the shoulder of the nearest man, in the yellow flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over howard and still working at the door. </s>
<s>  graham turned to the ladder again, and was thrust by his conductor and helped up by those above, and then he was standing on something hard and cold and slippery outside the ventilating funnel. </s>
<s>  he shivered. </s>
<s>  he was aware of a great difference in the temperature. </s>
<s>  half a dozen men stood about him, and light flakes of snow touched hands and face and melted. </s>
<s>  for a moment it was dark, then for a flash a ghastly violet white, and then everything was dark again. </s>
<s>  he saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast city structure which had replaced the miscellaneous houses, streets and open spaces of victorian london. </s>
<s>  the place upon which he stood was level, with huge serpentine cables iying athwart it in every direction. </s>
<s>  the circular wheels of a number of windmills loomed indistinct and gigantic through the darkness and snowfall, and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful white light smote up from below, touched the snow eddies with a transient glitter, and made an evanescent spectre in the night. </s>
<s>  and here and there, low down! some vaguely outlined wind-driven mechanism flickered with livid sparks. </s>
<s>  all this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stood about him. </s>
<s>  someone threw a thick soft cloak of fur-like texture about him, and fastened it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders. </s>
<s>  things were said briefly, decisively. </s>
<s>  someone thrust him forward. </s>
<s>  before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm. </s>
<s>  "this way," said this shape, urging him along, and pointed graham across the flat roof in the direction of a dim semicircular haze of light. </s>
<s>  graham obeyed. </s>
<s>  "mind!" said a voice, as graham stumbled against a cable. </s>
<s>  "between them and not across them," said the voice. </s>
<s>   "we must hurry. </s>
<s> " "where are the people? " said graham. </s>
<s>  "the people you said awaited me? " the stranger did not answer. </s>
<s>  he left graham's arm as the path grew narrower, and led the way with rapid strides. </s>
<s>  graham followed blindly. </s>
<s>  in a minute he found himself running. </s>
<s>  "are the others coming?" he panted, but received no reply. </s>
<s>  his companion glanced back and ran on. </s>
<s>  they came to a sort of pathway of open metal-work, transverse to the direction they had come, and they turned aside to follow this. </s>
<s>  graham looked back, but the snowstorm had hidden the others. </s>
<s>  "come on!" said his guide. </s>
<s>  running now, they drew near a little windmill spinning high in the air. </s>
<s>  "stoop," said graham's guide, and they avoided an endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane. </s>
<s>  "this way!" and they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted thawing snow, between two low walls of metal that presently rose waist high. </s>
<s>  "i will go first," said the guide. </s>
<s>  graham drew his cloak about him and followed. </s>
<s>  then suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter leapt to the snowy darkness of the further side. </s>
<s>  graham peeped over the side once and the gulf was black. </s>
<s>  for a moment he regretted his flight. </s>
<s>  he dared not look again, and his brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow. </s>
<s>  then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat space damp with thawing snow, and for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that went to and fro underneath. </s>
<s>  he hesitated at this unstable looking substance, but his guide ran on unheeding, and so they came to and clambered up slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass. </s>
<s>  round this they went. </s>
<s>  far below a number of people seemed to be dancing, and music filtered through the dome. </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  graham fancied he heard a shouting through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him on with a new spurt of haste. </s>
<s>  they clambered panting to a space of huge windmills, one so vast that only the lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight and rushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow. </s>
<s>  they hurried for a time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and came at last above a place of moving platforms like the place into which graham had looked from the balcony. </s>
<s>  they crawled across the sloping transparency that covered this street of platforms, crawling on hands and knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall. </s>
<s>  for the most part the glass was bedewed, and graham saw only hazy suggestions of the forms below, but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was clear, and he found himself looking sheerly down upon it all. </s>
<s>  for awhile, in spite of the urgency of his guide, he gave way to vertigo and lay spread-eagled on the glass, sick and paralysed. </s>
<s>  far below, mere stirring specks and dots, went the people of the unsleeping city in their perpetual daylight, and the moving platforms ran on their incessant journey. </s>
<s>  messengers and men on unknown businesses shot along the drooping cables and the frail bridges were crowded with men. </s>
<s>  it was like peering into a gigantic glass hive, and it lay vertically below him with only a tough glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall. </s>
<s>  the street showed warm and lit, and graham was wet now to the skin with thawing snow, and his feet were numbed with cold. </s>
<s>  for a space he could not move. </s>
<s>  "come on!" cried his guide, with terror in his voice. </s>
<s>  "come on!" graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort. </s>
<s>  over the ridge, following his guide's example, he turned about and slid backward down the opposite slope very swiftly, amid a little avalanche of snow while he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some broken gap should come in his way. </s>
<s>  at the edge he stumbled to his feet ankle deep in slush thanking heaven for an opaque footing again. </s>
<s>  his guide was already clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse. </s>
<s>  through the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vast windmills, and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced with a deafening sound. </s>
<s>  it was a mechanical shrilling of extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously from every point of the compass. </s>
<s>  "they have missed us already!" cried graham's guide in an accent of terror, and suddenly, with a blinding flash, the night became day. </s>
<s>  above the driving snow, from the summits of the wind-wheels, appeared vast masts carrying globes of livid light. </s>
<s>  they receded in illimitable vistas in every direction. </s>
<s>  as far as his eye could penetrate the snowfall they glared. </s>
<s>  "get on this," cried graham's conductor, and thrust him forward to a long grating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two slightly sloping expanses of snow. </s>
<s>  it felt warm to graham's benurrled feet, and a faint eddy of steam rose from it. </s>
<s>  "come on!" shouted his guide ten yards off,  without waiting, ran swiftly through the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the next range of wind-wheels. </s>
<s>  graham, recovering from his astonishment, followed as fast, convinced of his imminent capture. </s>
<s>  in a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black shadows shot with moving bars beneath the monstrous wheels. </s>
<s>  graham's conductor ran on for some time, and suddenly darted sideways and vanished into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge support. </s>
<s>  in another moment graham was beside him. </s>
<s>  they cowered panting and stared out. </s>
<s>  the scene upon which graham looked was very wild and strange. </s>
<s>  the snow had now almost ceased. </s>

<s>  but the broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly white, broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable darkness, vast ungainly titans of shadow. </s>
<s>  all about them, huge metallic structures, iron girders, inhumanly vast as it seemed to him, interlaced, and the edges of wind-wheels, scarcely moving in the lull, i passed in great shining curves steeper and steeper up into a luminous haze. </s>
<s>  wherever the snow-spangled light struck down, beams and girders, and incessant bands running with a halting, indomitable resolution passed upward and downward into the black. </s>
<s>  and with all that mighty activity, with an omnipresent sense of motive and design, this snow-clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all human presence save themselves, seemed as trackless and deserted and unfrequented by men as some inaccessible alpine snowfield. </s>
<s>  "they will be chasing us," cried the leader. </s>
<s>  "we are scarcely halfway there yet. </s>
<s>  cold as it is we must hide here for a space--at least until it snows more thickly again. </s>
<s> " his teeth chattered in his head. </s>
<s>  "where are the markets? " asked graham staring out. </s>
<s>  "where are all the people? " the other made no answer. </s>
<s>  "look!" whispered graham, crouched close, and became very still. </s>
<s>  the snow had suddenly become thick again, and sliding with the whirling eddies out of the black pit of the sky came something, vague and large and very swift. </s>
<s>  it came down in a steep curve and swept round, wide wings extended and a trail of white condensing steam behind it, rose with an easy swiftness and went gliding up the air, swept horizontally forward in a wide curve, and vanished again in the steaming specks of snow. </s>
<s>   through the ribs of its body, graham saw two little men, very minute and active, searching the snowy areas about him, as it seemed to him, with field glasses. </s>
<s>  for a second they were clear, then hazy through a thick whirl of snow, then small and distant, and in a minute they were gone. </s>
<s>  "now!" cried his companion. </s>
<s>  "come!" he pulled graham's sleeve, and incontinently the two were running headlong down the arcade of ironwork beneath the wind-wheels. </s>
<s>  graham, running blindly, collided with his leader, who had turned back on him suddenly. </s>
<s>  he found himself within a dozen yards of a black chasm. </s>
<s>  it extended as far as he could see right and left. </s>
<s>  it seemed to cut off their progress in either direction. </s>
<s>  "do as i do," whispered his guide. </s>
<s>  he lay down and crawled to the edge, thrust his head over and twisted until one leg hung. </s>

<s>  his head reappeared. </s>
<s>  "it is a ledge," he whispered. </s>
<s>  "in the dark all the way along. </s>
<s>  do as i did. </s>

<s>  for a sickly moment he had courage neither to go on nor retreat, then he sat and hung his leg down, felt his guide's hands pulling at him, had a horrible sensation of sliding over the edge into the unfathomable, splashed, and felt himself in a slushy gutter, impenetrably dark. </s>
<s>  "this way," whispered the voice, and he began crawling along the gutter through the trickling thaw, pressing himself against the wall. </s>
<s>  they continued along it for some minutes. </s>
<s>  he seemed to pass through a hundred stages of misery, to pass minute after minute through a hundred degrees of cold, damp, and exhaustion. </s>
<s>  in a little while he ceased to feel his hands and feet. </s>
<s>  the gutter sloped downwards. </s>
<s>  he observed that they were now many feet below the edge of the buildings. </s>
<s>  rows of spectral white shapes like the ghosts of blind-drawn windows rose above them. </s>
<s>  they came to the end of a cable fastened above one of these white windows, dimly visible and dropping into impenetrable shadows. </s>
<s>  suddenly his hand came against his guide's. </s>
<s>  "still!" whispered the latter very softly. </s>
<s>  he looked up with a start and saw the huge wings of the flying machine gliding slowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of snow-flecked grey-blue sky. </s>
<s>  in a moment it was hidden again. </s>
<s>  "keep still. </s>
<s>  they were just turning. </s>
<s> " for awhile both were motionless, then graham's companion stood up, and reaching towards the fastenings of the cable fumbled with some indistinct tackle. </s>
<s>  "what is that? " asked graham. </s>
<s>  the only answer was a faint cry. </s>
<s>  the man crouched motionless. </s>
<s>  graham peered and saw his face dimly. </s>
<s>  he was staring down the long ribbon of sky, and graham, following his eyes, saw the flying machine small and faint and remote. </s>
<s>  then he saw that the wings spread on either side, that it headed towards them, that every moment it grew larger. </s>
<s>  it was following the edge of the chasm towards them. </s>
<s>  the man's movements became convulsive. </s>
<s>  he thrust two cross bars into graham's hand. </s>
<s>  graham could not see them, he ascertained their form by feeling. </s>
<s>  they were slung by thin cords to the cable. </s>
<s>  on the cord were hand grips of some soft elastic substance. </s>
<s>  "put the cross between your legs," whispered the guide hysterically, "and grip the holdfasts. </s>
<s>  grip tightly, grip!" graham did as he was told. </s>
<s>  "jump," said the voice. </s>
<s>  "in heaven's name, jump!" for one momentous second graham could not speak. </s>
<s>  he was glad afterwards that darkness hid his face. </s>
<s>  he said nothing. </s>
<s>  he began to tremble violently. </s>
<s>  he looked sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the sky as it rushed upon him. </s>
<s>  "jump! jump--in god's name! or they will have us," cried graham's guide, and in the violence of his passion thrust him forward. </s>
<s>  graham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry, a cry in spite of himself, and then, as the flying machine swept over them, fell forward into the pit of that darkness, seated on the cross wood and holding the ropes with the clutch of death. </s>
<s>  something cracked, something rapped smartly against a wall. </s>
<s>  he heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its rope. </s>
<s>  he heard the aeronauts shout. </s>
<s>  he felt a pair of knees digging into his back. </s>
<s>  he was sweeping headlong through the air, falling through the air. </s>
<s>  all his strength was in his hands. </s>
<s>  he would have screamed but he had no breath. </s>
<s>  he shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter. </s>
<s>  he recognised the great passage with the running ways, the hanging lights and interlacing girders. </s>
<s>  they rushed upward and by him. </s>
<s>  he had a momentary impression of a great circular aperture yawning to swallow him up. </s>
<s>  he was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping with aching hands, and behold! a clap of sound, a burst of light, and he was in a brightly lit hall with a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet. </s>
<s>  the people! his people! a proscenium, a stage rushed up towards him, and his cable swept down to a circular aperture to the right of this. </s>
<s>  he felt he was travelling slower, and suddenly very much slower. </s>
<s>  he distinguished shouts of "saved! the master. </s>
<s>  he is safe!" the stage rushed up towards him with rapidly diminishing swiftness. </s>
<s>  then--. </s>
<s>  he heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified, and this shout was echoed by a shout from below. </s>
<s>  he felt that he was no longer gliding along the cable but falling with it. </s>
<s>  there was a tumult of yells, screams and cries. </s>
<s>  he felt something soft against his extended h and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm. </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  . </s>
<s>  he wanted to be still and the people were lifting him. </s>
<s>  he believed afterwards he was carried to the platform and given some drink, but he was never sure. </s>
<s>  he did not notice what became of his guide. </s>
<s>  when his mind was clear again he was on his feet. </s>
<s>  eager hands were assisting him to stand. </s>
<s>  he was in a big alcove, occupying the position that in his previous experience had been devoted to the lower boxes. </s>
<s>  if this was indeed a theatre. </s>
<s>  a mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar, the shouting of a countless multitude. </s>
<s> " it is the sleeper! the sleeper is with us!" "the sleeper is with us! the master--the owner! the master is with us. </s>
<s>  he is safe. </s>
<s> " graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people. </s>
<s>  he saw no individuals, he was conscious of a froth of pink faces, of waving arms and garments, he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring over him, buoying him up. </s>
<s>  there were balconies, galleries, great archways giving remoter perspectives, and everywhere people, a vast arena of people, densely packed and cheering. </s>
<s>  across the nearer space lay the collapsed cable like a huge snake. </s>
<s>  it had been cut by the men of the flying machine at its upper end, and had crumpled down into the hall. </s>
<s>  men seemed to be hauling this out of the way. </s>
<s>  but the whole effect was vague, the very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the voices. </s>
<s>  he stood unsteadily and looked at those about him. </s>
<s>  someone supported him by one arm. </s>
<s>  "let me go into a little room," he said, weeping. </s>
<s>  "a little room," and could say no more. </s>
<s>  a man in black stepped forward, took his disengaged arm. </s>
<s>  he was aware of officious men opening a door before him. </s>
<s>  someone guided him to a seat. </s>
<s>  he staggered. </s>
<s>  he sat down heavily and covered his face with his hands. </s>
<s>  he was trembling violently, his nervous control was at an end. </s>
<s>  he was relieved of his cloak, he could not remember how. </s>
<s>  his purple hose he saw were black with wet. </s>
<s>  people were running about him, things were happening, but for some time he gave no heed to them. </s>
<s>  he had escaped. </s>
<s>  a myriad of cries told him that. </s>
<s>  he was safe. </s>
<s>  these were the people who were on his side. </s>
<s>  for a space he sobbed for breath, and then he sat still with his face covered. </s>
<s>  the air was full of the shouting of innumerable men. </s>
<s>  chapter ix the people march he became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention, looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment. </s>
<s>  he took the dose forthwith, and in a moment he was glowing. </s>
<s>  a tall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder, and pointed to the half open door into the hall. </s>
<s>  this man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the great theatre. </s>
<s>  behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe, whom graham, even in this confusion, perceived to be beautiful. </s>
<s>  her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity,-were fixed on him, her lips trembled apart. </s>
<s>  a partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering, clapping and shouting that died away and began again, and rose to a thunderous pitch, and so continued intermittently all the time that graham remained in the little room. </s>
<s>  he watched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some clumsy explanation. </s>
<s>  he stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly. </s>
<s>  he grasped the arm of this shouting person. </s>
<s>  "tell me !" he cried. </s>
<s>  " who am i? who am i?" the others came nearer to hear his words. </s>
<s>  "who am i?" his eyes searched their faces. </s>
<s>  "they have told him nothing!" cried the girl. </s>
<s>  "tell me, tell me !" cried graham. </s>
<s>  "you are the master of the earth. </s>
<s>  you are owner of half the world. </s>
<s> " he did not believe he heard aright. </s>
<s>  he resisted the persuasion. </s>
<s>  he pretended not to underst not to hear. </s>
<s>  he lifted his voice again. </s>
<s>  "i have been awake three days--a prisoner three days. </s>
<s>  i judge there is some struggle between a number of people in this city--it is london?" "yes," said the younger man. </s>
<s>  "and those who meet in the great hall with the white atlas? how does it concern me? in some way it has to do with me. </s>
<s>  why, i don't know. </s>
<s>  drugs? it seems to me that while i have slept the world has gone mad. </s>
<s>  i have gone mad. </s>
<s> " "who are those councillors under the atlas? why should they try to drug me?" "to keep you insensible," said the man in yellow. </s>
<s>  "to prevent your interference. </s>
<s> " " but _why?__" "because __you__ are the atlas, sire," said the man in yellow. </s>
<s>  "the world is on your shoulders. </s>
<s>  they rule it in your name. </s>
<s> " the sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one monotonous voice. </s>
<s>  now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came a deafening tumult, a roaring and thundering, cheer crowded on cheer, voices hoarse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted the people in the little room could not hear each other shout. </s>
<s>  graham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had just heard. </s>
<s>  "the council," he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a name that had struck him. </s>
<s>  "but who is ostrog?" he said. </s>
<s>  "he is the organiser--the organiser of the revolt. </s>
<s>  our leader--in your name. </s>
<s> " "in my name?-- and you? why is he not here?" "he--has deputed us. </s>
<s>  i am his brother--his half-brother, lincoln. </s>
<s>  he wants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him. </s>
<s>  that is why he has sent. </s>
<s>  he is at the wind-vane offices directing. </s>
<s>  the people are marching. </s>
<s> " "in your name," shouted the younger man. </s>
<s>  "they have ruled, crushed, tyrannised. </s>
<s>  at last even--" "in my name! my name! master?" the younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder, indignant and vociferous, a high penetrating voice under his red aquiline nose and bushy moustache. </s>
<s>  "no one expected you to wake. </s>
<s>  no one expected you to wake. </s>
<s>  they were cunning. </s>
<s>  damned tyrants! but they were taken by surprise. </s>
<s>  they did not know whether to drug you, hypnotise you, kill you. </s>
<s> " again the hall dominated everything. </s>
<s>  "ostrog is at the wind-vane offices ready--. </s>
<s>  even now there is a rumour of fighting beginning. </s>
<s> " the man who had called himself lincoln came close to him. </s>
<s>  "ostrog has it planned. </s>
<s>  trust him. </s>
<s>  we have our organisations ready. </s>
<s>  we shall seize the flying stages--. </s>
<s>  even now he may be doing that. </s>
<s>  then--" "this public theatre," bawled the man in yellow, "is only a contingent. </s>

<s>  therefore i exercise myself in arms, and seek to put off the day when the vigour of youth must leave me. </s>
